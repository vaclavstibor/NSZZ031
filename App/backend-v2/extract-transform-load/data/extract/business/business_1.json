        "content": "Inflation is back down to more normal levels. But at the Bank of England, there are concerns that the battle to keep it close to the 2% target set by the previous government has yet to be decisively won. Official figures from June show the headline measure remained bang on target for a second month in a row, raising hopes that the worst of the inflationary burst after the exit from Covid lockdowns and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has passed. After the Bank hiked interest rates 14 times, to 5.25% – the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis – to fight inflation, there have been hopes for some time that a return to more normal levels could warrant a cut in official borrowing costs. Having come down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, signs of stability in consumer price growth will come as welcome relief to households and businesses. However, the cost of living still remains significantly higher than three years ago, and the Bank is worried that inflation will bump back above its target within months. Of most concern to Threadneedle Street will be signs of stubborn inflationary pressure in the services sector – one of the key areas the Bank has said it closely monitors when considering whether to sanction a rate cut. The latest figures showed services inflation held steady at 5.7%, a blow for those advocating a cut. The ONS said three main sub-sectors were contributing to the sticky levels of price growth: restaurants and cafes, rents and hotels. Some economists said this could be down to Taylor Swift’s Era’s tour landing in Britain last month, triggering a boom in demand for hotels and other consumer-facing services as Swifties flocked to concert venues across the UK. For stubborn inflation, read: “It’s me, hi, I’m the problem, it’s me?” The ONS isn’t so sure. The government statisticians logged many of the prices in their dataset before the concerts took place, while its samples were taken from hotels across the country, not just in places where Taylormania had taken hold. There may have been some evidence of Swift’s impact in inflation in hotels, where average price growth rose from 7% in May to 9.8% in June. But cultural services inflation, which would capture ticket prices, dipped from 7.4% to 7.3%. Financial markets are, however, taking a cue that domestic inflationary pressures could prove more persistent than hoped. The chances of the Bank cutting rates at its next policy meeting on 1 August have slipped from about 50% to close to 35%, while the pound strengthened to a one-year high, breaking through $1.30 on the global currency markets. Several members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, including its chief economist, Huw Pill, have warned in the past week that service sector inflation and a tight jobs market could force Threadneedle Street to take a cautious approach. Official figures from the jobs market are due to be published on Thursday, giving the central bank plenty of time to come up with a view before its next meeting. Some economists, however, believe that when it comes to signs of inflation persistence in the service sector, the Bank should shake it off. Goods prices, and in particular durable goods prices, remain firmly in deflation. Producer price inflation – reflecting factory gate prices, which can act as a guide to future consumer prices – was also weaker than expected. With concerns that high interest rates are weighing heavily on the economy and households unnecessarily, there will be growing demands for a cut in borrowing costs.",

        "content": "Rachel Delacour, chief executive and founder of sustainability management firm Sweep,which works with the energy firm SSE and others, welcomed the government’s plans to establish Great British Energy and invest billions in renewables, as mentioned in today’s king’s speech. GB Energy will be headquartered in Scotland, where much of the UK’s oil and gas and offshore wind industries are based). She said this is “a major step in the right direction for the UK’s journey towards net zero”. She added All organisations need to tackle their greenhouse gas emissions, and governments creating the conditions for them to access cleaner energy is a key part of the puzzle. However, it is crucial that the government puts the appropriate structure in place around a project of this size. This means monitoring it through stringent data collection processes, understanding the impact Great British Energy will have on the environment itself, and providing its users – especially businesses – with the detailed insights needed to reduce carbon emissions. It is only through taking such measures that Great British Energy can truly monitor its impact across the UK and support UK businesses to meet science-based climate targets. Anthony Codling, housing analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: King’s Speech, no surprises, but no details either. The King said that his government would Get Britain building through planning reform as they seek to accelerate the delivery of high quality infrastructure and housing through a Planning and Infrastructure Bill. There was no mention of targets, no 1.5m homes, and no mention of social housing ‘percentages’, suggesting that Labour will take a pragmatic approach to social and affordable housing supply. However, we expect that Labour will push ahead with its plan to build 1.5m homes over the next five years and do all it can to the planning system to help get Britain building. We expect the housebuilders shares to re-rate as the Labour Policies move from manifesto pledges to policy action. Renters will be happy that no fault evictions will be banned, and homeowners will welcome the plans to reform leasehold and commonholds. The king’s Speech has set out plans to “start mending broken public services,” says the union Unison. Its general secretary Christina McAnea said: These bills are the start of the long process to mend much of what’s been broken by Conservative governments and generate the growth to get public services thriving once more. Labour’s workplace rights package promises to be a game changer. For too long, bad bosses have had it all their own way. The new deal is a chance to reset the dial in favour of good employers and every UK worker and jobseeker. Outdated practices like ‘fire and rehire’ and zero-hours are to be consigned to history in a move that’s understandably proved popular with voters from across the political spectrum. Social care gets some attention at last too. After years of government neglect, the fair pay agreement is the first sign things are set to change, with a national care service the ultimate prize. Once the new pay agreement is in place, wages in care will rise across England, easing the sector’s staffing nightmare and relieving pressure on the NHS. The government’s growth agenda is closely linked to devolved regional and local services, yet many councils are teetering on the brink of effective bankruptcy. Devolving powers and reforming planning regimes can only help generate growth if local government receives sustainable, long-term funding and is able to retain expert staff. Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pension schemes bill, announced in the king’s speech, is good news, bringing simplicity and greater flexibility, something that the financial services firm has been calling for. Boosting retirement outcomes through a leaner, more efficient system is at its heart. Government estimates that the introduction of these measures could boost the average person’s pension pot by 9% over the course of their career. With recent data from HL’s Savings and Resilience Barometer showing only 38% of households are on track for a moderate retirement such changes are vital. There are measures in place aimed at dealing with the lingering ‘lost pots’ problem with deferred pots being automatically brought together in one place. Keeping track of every pension can mean people enter retirement with a better view of exactly how much they have and this can significantly improve retirement decision making. Ensuring we can build on the small pots plan and use the infrastructure to support a Lifetime Pension will be essential to stop the flow of small pots and allow for people who change jobs frequently to take control of their retirement planning. Allowing people to choose their pension provider will also have benefits for engagement and improve market competition based on which schemes support people and their retirements the best. Schemes will also be under pressure to prove they are offering value for money through the introduction of a standardised test. How metrics related to cost, returns, service and member engagement will be crucial here. Value for money should also drive consolidation within the pensions market amounting to a smaller number of much larger defined contribution schemes. The shift towards consolidation across both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes is expected to bring more efficiencies and lower costs. It will also boost the ability for UK pension schemes to invest in more productive assets – a key goal for government which can not only boost pension scheme growth and people’s retirement incomes - but also that of the UK economy. Pete Mugleston, managing director of the website onlinemortgageadvisor, has also looked at the housing measures: In light of the recent King’s Speech by the Labour government, the proposed housing policies signify a turning point for the UK housing market. By addressing long-standing issues and introducing new initiatives, the Labour government hopes to reinvigorate the sector. Labour’s plan to build 1.5m homes and have mandatory housing targets for councils over the next five years is encouraging. Increasing the housing supply can help alleviate the intense competition that often drives up property prices. By expanding the availability of homes, the government aims to create a more balanced market where buyers have more choices, reducing the pressures homeowners often feel with aggressive bidding and overpaying. This new policy can also stimulate business spending and attract foreign investment, leading to job creation and a more robust economy in the future. Turning to renters, he said: One of the most significant elements of the King’s Speech is Labour’s plans to protect renters’ rights by reintroducing the Renters Reform Bill. Central to this bill is empowering renters to challenge “unreasonable” rent increases. This is welcome news for many renters in the UK who are currently dealing with the cost of living crisis, where their rent has increased more than their wages. For those looking to buy houses, these reforms have the potential to bring much-needed relief. By increasing the housing supply across the country these policies could stabilise or even lower property prices, making homeownership more attainable for many first-time homeowners. Pair this with inflation holding steady at 2% this month, it could indicate to the Bank of England to finally lower interest rates from 5.2%. ‘This should make mortgages more affordable and reduce homeowners’ monthly payments helping to ease the financial burden for many. Here is some instant reaction to the king’s speech. Nigel Bishop of Recoco Property Search said: Labour’s announcement to levy VAT on private school fees has been labelled one of the party’s more controversial ones. This will leave many parents unable to afford private school education and inevitably impact on the property market by boosting demand for properties in close proximity to good state schools. Properties in these catchment areas can already ask a 20% premium and a politically-caused boost in demand for such homes will create an even more competitive market for buyers. Labour’s manifesto pledged to improve the UK’s housing market and the party is under immense pressure to deliver. One promise was to build 1.5 million homes and we are interested to learn more about Labour’s plans to utilise “poor quality” green belt areas as this will likely be met by protests from some local residents and organisations. Britain’s new centre-left government said it will help the country move on from a cost-of-living crisis by focusing on wealth creation, as it set out its plans for the coming year. A speech written by the Labour government and delivered in parliament by King Charles III said Labour will get more houses and infrastructure projects built, strengthen workers’ rights and create a new industrial strategy. The king said the goal is to “see rising living standards in all nations and regions of the United Kingdom.” Labour won the UK’s general election on 4 July by a landslide, with voters keen to see change after 14 years of Conservative Party rule. King Charles is setting out Labour government’s plans and priorities in his speech at the state opening of parliament, and you can following it live here: The German government has passed its 2025 budget after months of wrangling, Reuters reported citing government sources -- even though a €17bn gap between projected spending and revenue has still to be covered. The government hopes to plug the hole with additional tax revenues when the economy picks up. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, skirted a recession at the start of the year but growth has been slower than expected. Germany’s budget for next year includes a record €78bn of investments and net borrowing of €43.8bn, and an economic package aimed at reviving growth. The budget totals €481bn, and complies with a constitutionally enshrined cap on spending, known as the debt brake. German finance minister Christian Lindner said today: We are complying with the debt brake, which makes us an anchor of stability in Europe. With our growth initiative, we are providing important economic policy impetus to make Germany more attractive as a business location. New room for manoeuvre in the budget can only be created through more economic growth. A year before Germany’s next federal election, and ahead of regional elections in September, reaching agreement on the budget has been a major test for the coalition government made of chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats, the Greens and the liberals (FDP). In June’s European election, the ruling parties fared poorly, and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) came second behind the conservatives. Here are the main drivers behind UK inflation holding at 2% in June: In the eurozone, annual inflation dipped to 2.5% in June from 2.6% in May. A year earlier, the rate was 5.5%, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. The lowest annual inflation rates were registered in Finland (0.5%), Italy (0.9%) and Lithuania (1.0%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Belgium (5.4%), Romania (5.3%), Spain and Hungary (both 3.6%). The highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services, followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, non-energy industrial goods and energy. The pound has risen by 0.5% to $1.3032, its highest level since mid-July last year, after the higher-than-expected UK inflation figures, which analysts said diminished the chances of an August rate cut. Against the euro, sterling touched a two-year high of €1.1927 and is now trading at €1.1905. Sterling has risen by 2.4% against the dollar so far this year, and by 3.3% against the euro. The FTSE 100 index has lost nearly 20 points to 8,146, a 0.2% fall, while other European markets have also slipped, dragged down by the Dutch semicondutor firm ASML following a weak forecast. Investors are also concerned about potentially stricter US trade rules. Facing pushback to its chip crackdown on China, the US has told its allies that it is considering using the most severe trade restrictions available if companies such as Tokyo Electron and ASML continue to give China access to advanced semiconductor technology, Bloomberg News reported. It said: Seeking leverage with allies, the US is mulling whether to impose a measure called the foreign direct product rule, or FDPR, said people familiar with recent discussions. The rule lets the country impose controls on foreign-made products that use even the tiniest amount of American technology. Here is our full story on HSBC naming its new boss. HSBC has appointed its finance chief, Georges Elhedery, as the bank’s new chief executive to replace Noel Quinn, who is stepping down after five years in the role. He was widely seen as the top favourite for the job. Elhedery, who will take on the post in September, is being promoted from chief financial officer, which he took up in January last year. He can speak passable Mandarin, making him the first CEO in HSBC’s modern history to have that key language skill, according to Bloomberg. House price inflation in the UK picked up in May, while rents also continued to rise, according to official figures. House prices rose for a third month in a row, increasing by an annual 2.2% after a 1.3% rise in April, according to the Office for National Statistics. Private rents climbed by 8.6% in the year to June, down a tad from May’s annual rate of 8.7%. Workers at Amazon’s Coventry warehouse have voted against a historic trade union recognition deal, in a setback for campaigners who had been pushing for the right to collectively bargain over pay and conditions. Workers voted by a majority to reject the proposal for the GMB trade union to represent them in negotiations with the US online retailer. Union officials said Amazon had “created a culture of fear” and used intimidatory tactics to stifle support among the 3,000 strong workforce at the West Midlands hub after a battle for recognition lasting more than year. Stuart Richards, a GMB senior organiser, said the union would consider a legal challenge. From day one Amazon have been relentless in their attacks on their own workforce. We’ve seen workers pressured into attending six hours of anti-union seminars on top of the fortune spent by Amazon bosses to scare workers. Here is our full story inflation again: A consortium led by British tycoon Mike Jatania is close to agreeing a rescue deal for the Body Shop, administrators of the high street beauty chain said. A bidding team headed by by Jatania’s investment firm Aurea is in exclusive talks with joint administrators at FRP Advisory, with the former chief executive of beauty brand Molton Brown, Charles Denton, being lined up to lead the management team. In a joint statement issued by Aurea and administrators of the Body Shop International, they said they hope that a deal can be struck in the “coming weeks”. Aurea is now going through The Body Shop books, they added. Following a competitive bidding process, the joint administrators of The Body Shop International have now entered into an exclusivity agreement with a consortium led by Auréa group, with the management team to be led by former Molton Brown CEO Charles Denton. While the deal is not yet complete, we believe the combined experience of the consortium, together with the existing management team, represents the best outcome for creditors and will ultimately ensure the long-term success of The Body Shop. A period of due diligence will now take place, with the intention to complete the transaction in the coming weeks. The Body Shop collapsed into administration in early February, leading to hundreds of job losses and dozens of store closures. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at the brokerage Finalto, has looked at sterling: The Fed could cut rates ahead of the Bank of England, which should offer some near-term support for sterling. My fear is that the BoE is being too cautious here. Nevertheless if we see this move in sterling sustained we should consider a new trading range for the pound between $1.30 and $1.40. We should not discount the effects of the politics on this for now, in the eyes of investors at least – a degree more clarity and consistency in terms of policymaking. There is clearly a reset and people are looking at the UK with fresh eyes. The economy seems to be moving in the right direction and we are handling higher rates a lot better than expected despite the relatively strong transmission of monetary policy vs the US. That strong transmission should work in our favour when the BoE does start to cut…maybe the Bank is mindful that there is a lot of pent up energy in the old bulldog yet and it’s going be careful about unleashing it. Steve Clayton, head of equity funds at Hargreaves Lansdown, has looked at this morning’s main developments in the UK: Inflation figures released this morning show the Consumer Prices Index holding at 2% for the second month in succession. The headline figure will be welcomed in Downing Street, but the Bank of England is likely to be concerned that the pace of inflation in dervices remains stubbornly high at 5.7%, also unchanged on the month. Services inflation had been predicted to fall this month and its failure to do so could well leave the Bank’s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee wary of making any early reductions in UK rates…. suggesting good news for savers, but more pain for mortgage holders who may have to wait longer to see their monthly payments start to ease. Turning to the king’s speech at 11.30am BST, he said: King Charles will deliver the second King’s Speech of his reign later today, on behalf of the new Labour Government. Around 35 laws are set to be outlined as PM Starmer’s government unveils its plan to ‘take the brakes off Britain’. Key measures expected in the speech include a new planning bill, which will make it harder for councils to block development and powers forcing them to identify development land in their areas. More devolution in England will see mayoral powers increased, whilst GB Energy will be set up to drive de-carbonisation of the power grid with an £8.3bn budget to kick-start projects. Not everything will be new; bills tabled previously by the Conservatives but not yet enacted, like the phased ban on smoking are set to be put back onto the government’s agenda too. Babcock, the aerospace, defence and engineering company, said that it has seen a further deterioration in its performance under a contract to build five Type 31 frigates for the Royal Navy. The company is setting aside a further £90m provision, taken against upcoming full year results. The provision relates to expected future wage costs. The contract had allowed for wages rising in line with the consumer price index, but Babcock is finding that labour simply can’t be found in sufficient quantities at the wage rates built into the contract. The company also reports that Type 31 aside, underlying profits are sharply higher, and the improving state of its pension fund will allow future top-up contributions by the company to be £25m a year lower. HSBC has announced that Georges Elhedery, a long-time HSBC staffer, most recently serving as its chief financial officer, has been appointed to the top slot, replacing outgoing CEO Noel Quinn whose departure was announced a few weeks ago. Elhedery, a graduate of the Paris’s Ecole Polytechnique and the ENSAE, takes up his new role in September. Reckitt Benckiser said its Mead Johnson infant formula business has suffered a tornado strike to its warehouse in Mount Vernon, Indiana. No staff were injured by the tornado strike, although the surrounding community did see severe damage. Reckitt said the warehouse is out of action and business will be hit in the near term while it reorganises its operations. Sterling has just risen through the $1.30 mark after the higher-than-expected inflation figures. It’s up by 0.32% at $1.3007, the highest level in a year. Sterling also hit a near-two-year high against the euro of €1.1921. It’s also king’s speech day. At about 11.30am, shortly after leading the royal procession into the House of Lords and hopping on to his throne, King Charles will set out the new government’s agenda, writes my colleague Archie Bland. With Labour’s manifesto plan for mandatory housing targets at the heart of it, it’s probably going to be short on surprises. But it will start to flesh out the detail of how Keir Starmer intends to govern – and whether his party’s swollen backbench numbers might bring headaches as well as parliamentary security. Peter Arnold, UK chief economist at the EY Item Club, said: Inflation is unlikely to fall much further now. The contribution from the food and services categories should decline gradually as firms pass on the gains from their lower energy bills. However, the drag from falling energy prices will start to fade from July, and this is likely to mean that headline inflation temporarily drifts up towards the end of this year. But the bigger picture is one where the inflation pressure of the past three years has dissipated, and the EY Item Club expects a period of relatively low and stable inflation to underpin steady improvements in household spending power. The minutes of last month’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting made it clear that the committee is split, he said. The more hawkish members may see today’s data as evidence that their concerns about inflation persistence are well founded. The implications for the more dovish members are unclear. On the one hand, they indicated they were becoming less interested in backward-looking measures of inflation persistence and were adopting a more forward-looking approach. And that shift had occurred despite a string of overshoots for services inflation. But on the other hand, from a presentational point of view, they might feel that they need to wait for inflation to surprise on the downside before they move. A hawkish response from markets to today’s data might also encourage the MPC to wait. The BBC’s economics editor Faisal Islam said: Joel Hills, business and economics editor at ITV, said: Financial markets now see a 35% chance of an August rate cut, down from nearly 50% earlier this morning, and the pound has risen by 0.2% against the dollar to $1.2994. Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: For the majority of the MPC [ monetary policy committee], today’s inflation report won’t be as encouraging as it may have anticipated. Undoubtedly, today’s services print raises the bar for an August rate cut. But there is a key caveat here. With live music and accommodation prices rising at such speed, the MPC could potentially be minded to look past some of the upside in services inflation. To be sure, we now think that an August rate cut is finely balanced. A lot will now depend on the strength of the May wage and unemployment data. European stock markets have opened lower. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.43% and the Shanghai exchange lost 0.39% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng edged up by 0.1%. UK’s FTSE 100 index down 22 points, or 0.1%, at 8,156 Germany’s Dax down 0.4% France’s CAC down 0.3% Spain’s Ibex down 0.2% Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said headline inflation is likely to rise again this month on the back of energy costs, and it will take time to get services inflation down because wage growth remains strong. The services surprise was narrow this month, focused in accommodation services which rose 3.3% month-to-month, well above our forecast, 0.5%, which we suspect was close to the consensus forecast. We assume some of this was driven by surging demand due to live music events, with prices for the latter also rising sharply, by 7.5% year-over-year. That said, we had thought hotel prices would surge more if the ONS collected CPI on June 18—when Taylor Swift held an event in Cardiff—rather than June 11, which is when the ONS did collect prices. The surge in hotel prices is no doubt erratic, but there may also be some more underlying strength in that component than we assumed. Also supporting services inflation were rents rising 7.2% year-over-year in June, up from 7.0% in May and other services inflation ticking up to 5.2% year-over-year from 5.1% as we expected. Elsewhere services inflation eased mostly as expected but remained strong. Turning to the outlook for inflation, he said: We expect inflation to rise to 2.2% in July as utility prices fall less this year than in July 2023. Looking further ahead, food and non-energy goods inflation have no further to fall now they have converged to producer output price inflation while Ofgem will likely hike the utility price cap by 12% in October after wholesale energy costs have risen. Those components have accounted for almost all—9.0 percentage points—of CPI inflation’s 9.1pp fall since October 2022. Their contribution to year-over-year CPI inflation will rise 86bp by December. Getting inflation sustainably back to the 2% target will require services inflation to drop closer to 3.5%, but that will take time because wage growth remains strong. We look for CPI services inflation to fall only to 4.9% at the end of 2024. HSBC has named its finance chief Georges Elhedery as chief executive to replace 37-year veteran Noel Quinn. Elhedery, who will take on the role in September, has been promoted to the role after becoming its chief financial officer in January 2023. Sir Mark Tucker, the bank’s chair, said that Elhedery was the outstanding candidate and had a track record of “driving growth, delivering simplification and containing costs”. The appointment comes after Quinn unexpectedly announced that he was stepping down from the role after an “intense” five-year period. He will step down officially on 2 September but will remain available to the group until his gardening leave period ends on 30 April 2025. Elhedery will continue as CFO during this transition period. Elhedery began at HSBC in 2005 and has held roles as the of co-chief executive in HSBC’s global banking and markets division, while also leading the bank’s Middle Eastern, north Africa and Turkiye regional business between 2016 and 2019. Tucker said: During his career he has worked in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Since joining the board as group chief financial officer in early 2023 and throughout the selection process, he has demonstrated his strategic insight and vision, and deep international perspectives. The appointment comes after HSBC reported an 1.8% drop in pre-tax profit to $12.7bn (£10.1bn) in the first three months of 2024, better than analysts had forecast. Revenues increased by 3% to $20.8bn. The pound has now risen by 0.16% against the dollar to $1.2986, edging closer to the $1.30 level. It is also up by 0.1% versus the euro, at €1.1911. Isaac Stell, investment manager at the Wealth Club, said: Inflation in June was slightly ahead of expectations, but remains at the Bank of England’s target. The largest upward impact came from restaurants and hotels in a month where Taylor Swift has been touring the UK. The Swift effect remains a global phenomenon, and could well find its way into future economic textbooks. Eyes will now turn to the Bank of England’s meeting on the 1st August and the next interest rate decision. On target inflation may increase appetite for a rate cut, but core inflation looks less promising, muddying the water particularly around the stickier services inflation numbers, and making an August cut look increasingly unlikely. The pound has edged up marginally this morning, in a sign that currency markets at least don’t think rates will be cut in the short term. Other economists also say that the data lowers the chances of an interest rate cut in August. Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: The Bank will be relieved that headline inflation has remained at target in June in line with their expectations. That relief will be tempered though by services inflation holding at 5.7%, well above their expectations. Stickiness in services inflation – a key measure of domestic inflationary pressures – lowers the likelihood of an August rate reduction. All eyes will be on tomorrow’s wage data to see whether it will spur a summer rate cut by the MPC. Inflation is likely to rise slightly in the coming months, as energy price inflation picks up reinforcing sticky services inflation. But all being well, inflation should moderate further out, supporting a downward trend in interest rates. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: Headline inflation is in retreat and is running well below rates in the US and the euro area. Much of this decline reflects the effects of high food and energy prices dropping out of the numbers. Stripping those components out, UK core inflation is running at an uncomfortable 3.5%, above rates in the US and the euro area. A pick up in UK activity since the start of the year means that the service sector is generating quite high levels of inflation. That suggests the Bank of England has limited scope to cut rates this year. Dales explained: By staying at 5.7% in June, services inflation remained well above the 5.1% rate in June that the Bank of England forecast back in May. Admittedly, a lot of that overshoot happened in April and May. And that didn’t stop the BoE from sounding a bit dovish at the subsequent June policy meeting. Even so, the BoE expected services inflation to fall 0.2 percentage points in June, which didn’t happen. And only some of the stickiness of services inflation in June may be due to the influence of Taylor Swift’s concerts. They may have been behind some of the large rise in hotels inflation from 7.0% to 9.8%. But cultural services inflation, which would capture any influence from the ticket prices, dipped from 7.4% to 7.3%. As a result, it’s not obvious that the BoE can ignore a chunk of the stickiness of services inflation. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: Even though consumer prices index inflation stayed exactly in line with the 2.0% target in June, it’s the stability of services inflation at 5.7% that’s the blow. And it looks as though only a small part of that may have been due to the temporary effects of Taylor Swift’s concerts. As a result, the chances of an interest rate cut in August have diminished a bit more. Taylor Swift may have put pressure on UK inflation as fans splashed out on costly concert tickets, hotels and meals out. The American singer toured Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London in June. However, economists say that the Bank of England is likely to be more worried about sticky services inflation, which remained at an annual rate of 5.7% in June. Wage data tomorrow should shed further light on these price pressures. Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at the investment firm abrdn, said: Today’s inflation report will keep the Bank of England’s August rate decision on a knife edge. The strength of hotel price growth is suggestive of a so-called Taylor Swift effect on prices, but policy makers will almost certainly look through this kind of dynamic. More fundamentally, the ongoing stickiness of services inflation will leave the Bank wondering how long inflation will stay at the 2% target once favourable base effects have passed and domestic price pressures start to drive headline inflation again. Tomorrow’s wage data will provide more clues about these price pressures, and the Bank will hope to see a further moderation in wage growth. For now, we continue to expect a rate cut in August, but this will require the upcoming data to cooperate. In May, inflation hit the Bank of England’s target of 2% for the first time in nearly three years. Financial markets see a near-50% chance of a rate cut at the central bank’s next meeting on 1 August. The pound rose slightly on the higher-than-expected inflation data, and is trading at $1.2977. It has gained nearly 2% against the dollar this year. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: The data showed that inflation in Britain stagnated in June versus the expectation of a further easing. And higher-than-expected figures cooled down the expectation of an August rate cut from the Bank of England. But because the September Fed rate cut is already fully priced in, there is still room for a dovish BoE pricing into late summer – which means that we shall still see a limited upside potential in Cable: the $1.30 level could be hard to clear. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. It’s inflation day in the UK today. The headline annual inflation rate stayed at 2% in June, unchanged from May, according to the Office for National Statistics. Analysts had expected a further dip to 1.9%. Inflation was last lower than this in April 2021, when it stood at 1.5%. On a monthly basis, the consumer prices index rose by 0.1% in June from May. The largest upward contribution to inflation came from restaurants and hotels, where prices of hotels rose more than a year ago; the largest downward contribution came from clothing and footwear, with prices of garments falling this year having risen a year ago. The core rate of inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, stayed at 3.5%. The inflation figures will be the last the Bank of England sees before it decides on 1 August whether to cut interest rates from their current level of 5.25%. Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: It is welcome that inflation is at target, but we know that for families across Britain prices remain high. We face the legacy of fourteen years of chaos and economic irresponsibility. That is why this Government is taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of Britain better off.

        "content": "Pernod Ricard has agreed to sell off the majority of its international wine brands, including Jacob’s Creek and Campo Viejo, as the drinks company aims to focus on its spirits and champagne business. The Paris-based company, which is known for selling spirits such as Absolut vodka and Beefeater gin, said it was selling its wine brands produced in Australia, Spain and New Zealand to the owner of Australia’s Accolade Wines. Pernod did not disclose how much it was receiving from selling the brands to Australian Wine Holdco Ltd (AWL) but said the products sold 10m cases a year. It said the sale, which is expected to complete in the second half of 2025, would allow it to redirect its resources to its premium spirits and champagne brands. Pernod Ricard is among the world’s largest wine and spirits sellers, with its brands including Havana Club rum, Jameson Irish whiskey and Perrier-Jouet champagne. It competes globally with the UK’s Diageo, the owner of the Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff brands. It posted more than £10bn in sales last year, and recorded an operating profit of £2.8bn. Wine sales made up just 4% of this, a 2% fall on the previous year. The sale will also include the brands Orlando and St Hugo, from Australia; Stoneleigh, Brancott Estate and Church Road from New Zealand; and Ysios, Tarsus and Azpilicueta, which are produced in Spain. Pernod will retain its US and French wine brands, as well as labels in Argentina and China. The Accolade Wines owner AWL is a consortium of institutional investors with backers including the private equity firm Bain Capital. Last year, the fund bought Accolade Wines, Australia’s second largest producer, after it struggled to adapt to new Chinese tariffs and consumers shifting away from lower-priced wine brands. A Pernod Ricard statement said: “We will sell our wine division to a player of global scale, with a route to market solely dedicated to the wine industry. “Our wine brands will benefit from the focus required to achieve their potential, reinforce their position, and seize new opportunities around the world.” Joshua Hartz, a spokesperson for AWL, said: “Backed by AWL, the combined business will be better able to adapt to changing consumer tastes and meet the structural challenges facing the global wine industry.”",

        "title": "Hopes of August rate cut fall after UK inflation stays at 2%",
        "content": "The chances of an August interest rate cut have taken a blow after a sharp jump in hotel prices meant progress in the UK’s fight against inflation stalled last month. A near 9% jump in the cost of a hotel room – blamed by some analysts on a “Taylor Swift effect” – offset the impact of cut-price clothing to leave the government’s preferred measure of the cost of living at its 2% target for a second month in a row in June. With measures of underlying inflation also holding steady, the City said the prospect of the Bank of England reducing the cost of borrowing from its current level of 5.25% at its next meeting on 1 August had diminished. Financial markets trimmed their forecasts for the likelihood of an August cut down from a 50% to a 35% chance on Wednesday after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released the inflation data. The pound rose above $1.30 against the US dollar on the currency markets for the first time in a year amid expectations that rates would remain on hold until September or even November. The ONS figures showed core inflation – which excludes food, energy, alcoholic drinks and tobacco – was unchanged at 3.5%. Inflation in the services sector – closely watched by the Bank of England – remained steady at 5.7%, higher than the 5.1% expected by Threadneedle Street. Hotel prices rose by 8.8% annually in June, compared with a much smaller rise of 1.7% a year earlier. Analysts suggested this jump was partly generated by demand for stays around last month’s eight UK dates of Taylor Swift’s global Eras tour. Isaac Stell, an investment manager at the Wealth Club, said: “Inflation in June was slightly ahead of expectations but remains at the Bank of England’s target. The largest upward impact came from restaurants and hotels in a month where Taylor Swift has been touring the UK. The Swift effect remains a global phenomenon and could well find its way into future economic textbooks.” Luke Bartholomew, the deputy chief economist at the fund manager Abrdn, said: “Today’s inflation report will keep the Bank of England’s August rate decision on a knife-edge. The strength of hotel price growth is suggestive of a Taylor Swift effect on prices, but policymakers will almost certainly look through this kind of dynamic.” However, other analysts said the ONS had collected prices for the June inflation report before the bulk of Swift’s tour dates. Paul Dales, of Capital Economics, said: “Even though CPI inflation stayed exactly in line with the 2.0% target in June … it’s the stability of services inflation at 5.7% that’s the blow. And it looks as though only a small part of that may have been due to the temporary effects of Taylor Swift’s concerts. As a result, the chances of an interest rate cut in August have diminished a bit more.” Although the consensus in the financial markets had been for a fall to 1.9% last month as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), the ONS said inflation was still at its joint lowest level in nearly three years. The annual increase in the cost of living was last lower in April 2021, when it stood at 1.5%. Prices overall rose by 0.1% last month, matching the increase in the same month of 2023. Food price inflation continued to ease, dropping from 1.7% to 1.5%, while clothing and footwear prices rose by 1.6% in the year to June compared with 3% in the year to May. Hotel and restaurant inflation rose from 5.8% to 6.3%. Threadneedle Street’s rate setters on its nine-strong monetary policy committee expect inflation to rise to 2.5% in the second half of 2024 before falling back below the official 2% target. The ONS chief economist, Grant Fitzner, said: “Hotel prices rose strongly while secondhand car costs fell but by less than this time last year. However, these were offset by falling clothing prices, with widespread sales driving down their cost.” Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “It is welcome that inflation is at target, but we know that for families across Britain prices remain high. We face the legacy of 14 years of chaos and economic irresponsibility. That is why this government is taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of Britain better off.” George Dibb, the associate director for economic policy at left-leaning thinktank the IPPR, said: “Today’s data confirms that inflation is well on its way towards normalisation. Some inflation drivers, such as core inflation, are still elevated, but the Bank of England’s policy stance remains too tight. Interest rates have been too high for too long and need to come down to not hamper growth.”",

        "content": "The Body Shop is close to being bought out of administration after it agreed to exclusive rescue talks with a consortium led by the British cosmetics tycoon Mike Jatania. Jatania’s investment company, Auréa, is in negotiations with the UK cosmetic chain’s administrators over a deal. The Body Shop fell into administration in February, leading to hundreds of job losses and more than 80 shop closures. Charles Denton, the former chief executive of the beauty brand Molton Brown, will lead the new management team if a deal is struck. A joint statement by Auréa and the administrators, FRP Advisory, said that after a competitive bidding process Jatania’s company had begun carrying out due diligence checks, with a sale expected to be agreed in the coming weeks. It said: “While the deal is not yet complete, we believe the combined experience of the consortium, together with the existing management team, represents the best outcome for creditors and will ultimately ensure the long-term success of The Body Shop.” The Body Shop was founded by the late environmental and human rights campaigner Anita Roddick in 1976 and became a staple of the British high street, selling ethically produced cosmetic and skincare products. In February it went into administration after its owner, Aurelius, which had bought the company for £207m three months earlier, said it could not revive the business’s fortunes. It owed creditors more than £276m at the time. Administrators have since closed 82 shops, leaving 116 open, while 489 shop jobs and 270 office jobs have been cut. Last week, Bloomberg reported that administrators were close to striking a deal with Auréa after it beat rival bidders at auction. Auréa is led by Jatania and the former UBS group banker Paul Raphael and Pharmapacks founder Andrew Vagenas. It owns brands including Herbivore Botanicals a plant-based cosmetics firm; Scandinavian Biolabs, a natural haircare product; and Decypher, which produces and sells foundation makeup. Jatania previously ran Lornamead, which owned personal care brands including Lypsyl, Woods of Windsor, Yardley and Harmony haircare. He sold it to a rival, Li &amp; Fung, for about £155m more than 10 years ago.",

        "content": "HSBC has named its finance chief, Georges Elhedery, as its new chief executive, handing the reins to a bank veteran just as the global lender steels itself for fresh tensions between the US and China. Elhedery, who will take on the post in September, will replace Noel Quinn, who in April made the unexpected announcement that he was stepping down from the role after an “intense” five-year stint as chief executive. The appointment continues a long tradition of being promoted from chief financial officer, which he took up in January last year. Sir Mark Tucker, the HSBC Group chair, said Elhedery was the outstanding candidate and had a track record of “driving growth, delivering simplification and containing costs”. The appointment comes after the CEO, the 37-year HSBC veteran Quinn, announced unexpectedly in April that he was stepping down from the role after an “intense” five-year period. He will stand down officially on 2 September, while Elhedery continues as CFO in the interim. Quinn will remain available to the group until his gardening leave period ends on 30 April next year. Elhedery began at HSBC in 2005 and has held roles as the co-chief executive in HSBC’s global banking and markets division, while also leading the bank’s Middle East, north Africa and Turkey regional business between 2016 and 2019. Tucker said: “During his career he has worked in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Since joining the board as group chief financial officer in early 2023 and throughout the selection process, he has demonstrated his strategic insight and vision, and deep international perspectives.” Elhedery takes up the role after HSBC reported an 1.8% drop in pre-tax profit to $12.7bn (£10.1bn) in the first three months of 2024, better than analysts had forecast. Revenues increased by 3% to $20.8bn. Quinn’s five-year tenure at the helm of HSBC began when he was promoted on an interim basis after the ousting of previous boss John Flint after 18 months in the role. In that period, Quinn navigated the bank through the pandemic and slashed 35,000 jobs to save £3.5bn a year. He also led the company as it fended off demands from top shareholder Ping An to split off HSBC’s Asian business. The announcement of Elhedery’s appointment on Wednesday also revealed that he would receive a base salary of £1.38m a year, with a fixed allowance of £1.7m and a pension allowance of £137,6000. Elhedery will also be eligible for an annual incentive award which will have a maximum value of 215% of his base salary, and a long-term incentive award scheme worth 320% of his salary. Elhedery said: “Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory.” • This article was amended on 17 July 2024. An earlier version misspelled the first name of Georges Elhedery as “George”.",

        "title": "Titanic shipyard owner Harland & Wolff awaits news of funding lifeline",
        "content": "Harland &amp; Wolff, the owner of the Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic, has insisted that it is still awaiting a government decision on a £200m intervention despite signs that Labour is due to reject the financial lifeline. The company is presenting an early test of the Labour government’s industrial policy, with 1,500 workers fearful the company is running out of time to secure funding needed to make it ready to build three warships for the Royal Navy. Harland &amp; Wolff (H&amp;W) was forced to suspend its London-listed shares a fortnight ago, and it has missed two deadlines to file audited accounts, raising questions over its finances and its ability to fulfil a £1.6bn contract to build the three fleet solid support ships that will carry supplies such as ammunition and food to the navy’s aircraft carriers. The government, under the Conservative party, had provisionally agreed a deal to 100% underwrite a £200m loan by a consortium of lenders to Harland &amp; Wolff to allow it to refinance its debts. The company on Tuesday said it had reduced its request for the guarantee from 100% to 80%, and that it had presented legal opinions showing that a guarantee would not violate state aid rules. However, the Financial Times reported that Labour had decided that giving the guarantee would be an inappropriate use of government funds, citing an unnamed Whitehall source saying: “Giving the loan guarantee would be deeply irresponsible.” The company has been investing heavily to recruit a workforce of 1,500 across the Belfast site, plus yards at Appledore in Devon, and Methil and Arnish in Scotland. It plans to split work on the fleet solid support vessels across the yards, while working in a consortium with Spain’s state-owned Navantia. H&amp;W said that the former chancellor Jeremy Hunt approved the loan guarantee in principle in December. The spokesperson said the company was informed in March that officials were concerned about the fact that the government was underwriting the full value of the loan. A 100% guarantee would be an unusual step that would leave the taxpayer liable for the full amount if the company failed. “Harland &amp; Wolff is aware that the new ministers are in the process of being briefed by civil servants on our case,” the spokesperson said. “We have proposed a reworked deal at the standard 80% guaranteed level, that has been awarded to hundreds of other companies, and look forward to hearing the government’s response. “With the new government having been in office for just over a week, it will take time to work through the process. As yet, we have not been informed of any decision, and we stand ready to meet with the new government at their convenience.” Failure to obtain the guarantee would be a major blow to H&amp;W, which agreed the deal over a year ago with UK Export Finance, a ministerial department. If a government guarantee for the loan is not forthcoming, the company would be forced to ask private lenders for money at standard market rates to refinance its £191m in liabilities. The company’s main priority is refinancing £91m in loans from Riverstone Credit Management, a US private investor that is charging an interest rate of more than 14%. Payment is due at the end of this year. H&amp;W held a board meeting on Tuesday to discuss its finances, according to two sources. However, it has not given workers any updates on the talks, and management of the main shipyard in Belfast has not been briefed, leaving workers unclear over the future of their jobs. “The longer this goes on, the more concern there is,” said a person involved in talks. Labour has taken power with the future of several other UK industrial sites in the balance, including Belfast’s Short Brothers factory, which is being sold by Spirit Aerosystems to Airbus, and the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, where talks between the new government and the owner Tata Steel over decarbonisation and jobs are ongoing.",

        "title": "Every water firm in England and Wales under investigation over sewage spills",
        "content": "The water regulator is taking action against four more water companies, including Severn Trent and United Utilities, meaning every wastewater company in England and Wales is under investigation over sewage spills. Ofwat said it had served formal notices on Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water, Hafren Dyfrdwy, Severn Trent and United Utilities, asking them to provide evidence for its investigation into companies’ wastewater management in England and Wales. The regulator has looked at the companies’ environmental performance and data about how often they spill from storm overflows. It said this had heightened its “concerns that these companies may not be fulfilling their obligations to protect the environment and minimise pollution”. This means Ofwat is taking enforcement action against all 11 water and wastewater companies in England and Wales over sewage pollution. Once it has fully investigated, it will publish its findings and where appropriate take action over any breaches of legal obligations. Along with the Environment Agency, the regulator is investigating water companies over suspicions of widespread illegal sewage discharges across the network from thousands of treatment plants. The investigations have been going on for more than two years, with no findings published so far. In March, analysis of the latest data showed that more than 2,000 overflows owned by a number of companies were discharging raw sewage into rivers and seas. Ofwat’s investigations into Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, South West Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water are ongoing. Southern Water remains subject to enforcement monitoring after a record £126m fine in 2019 over “shocking” failures at the company’s sewage treatment sites that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England. David Black, the Ofwat chief executive, said: “The fact that Ofwat now has enforcement cases with all 11 of the wastewater companies in England and Wales demonstrates how concerned we are about the sector’s environmental performance. “Where we find that companies have breached their obligations, we will continue to act – over recent years, we have imposed penalties and payments of over £300m on water and wastewater companies. “This is the largest and most complex investigation Ofwat has undertaken. However, Ofwat is committed to concluding these cases as quickly as possible, so that the sector can focus on delivering the £88bn expenditure the 2024 price review will unlock to deliver cleaner rivers and seas. “As part of this package of investment, £10bn is earmarked to tackle storm overflows with a target to reduce spills from storm overflows by 44%.” Severn Trent recently announced a programme to significantly reduce use of storm overflow, which Ofwat welcomed. Shares for Severn Trent and United Utilities, which are listed on the stock market, fell by about 4% and 3%, respectively, after the regulator’s announcement. Last week, Ofwat was criticised for letting water companies put up bills by an average 21%, or £94, over five years to fund improvements in environmental standards, at a time when customers have endured poor service, sewage dumping and leaks. This was described as a “bitter pill” by the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Campaigners for clean water, including the former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey, argue that customers are in effect paying twice, and that they should not be paying for infrastructure investment that should have already been carried out to comply with companies’ operational permits. Severn Trent, United Utilities and Hafren Dyfrdwy said they would work “constructively” with Ofwat. A spokesperson for Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water issued a similar statement, saying: “We have been working closely with our regulators on the monitoring of our wastewater treatment works and are investing at record levels to improve service.”",

        "title": "World needs economic stability after a tough few years, but if Trump wins we’re unlikely to get it | Larry Elliott",
        "content": "Opinion polls conducted since the weekend suggest Donald Trump’s narrow escape from the attempt on his life in Pennsylvania has made his return to the White House more likely. Until now, little attention has been paid to what Trump 2.0 would mean for the US and wider global economy. That will now change. What the world needs is a period of stability after the repeated blows of recent years. Were Trump to avenge his 2020 defeat at Joe Biden’s hands come November, it would mean the opposite. Sure, there are other reasons for being anxious about a second Trump presidency, but anybody wondering what the next big economic shock might be after the pandemic and the war in Ukraine need look no further than the frontrunner to be in charge of the world’s biggest economy in six months’ time. In its latest health check on the global economy on Tuesday, the IMF highlighted the risks of big swings in economic policy as a result of elections this year. It did not mention the US by name but the implication was clear enough. Unaffordable tax cuts could lead to bigger debt problems, push up long-term interest rates and ratchet up protectionism. The IMF said: “Trade tariffs, alongside a scaling up of industrial policies worldwide, can generate damaging cross-border spillovers, as well as trigger retaliation, resulting in a costly race to the bottom.” Trump’s economic strategy is highly protectionist, it is also incoherent and dangerous. It is incoherent because he appears to think the tariffs he intends to impose on goods entering the US from China (and other countries) will pay for cuts in income tax. In reality, tariffs mean higher prices for US consumers, which will hurt those on low and middle incomes the most. The tax cuts will mostly benefit corporations and better-off individuals. It is dangerous in a number of ways. For a start, there is the risk of prompting a full-blown trade war with China. Then there is the threat that higher prices for imports will drive up US inflation, leading to higher interest rates. Tough curbs on immigration are promised, and these will have the effect of reducing labour supply and adding to the upward pressure on wages. Finally, there are likely to be consequences should Trump go ahead with his isolationist diplomatic policy: more expensive commodities and more jittery financial markets. Trump likes a weak dollar, but in the past the dollar has strengthened in times of heightened global instability, something a Trump presidency makes far more likely. The possible consequences of all this are obvious: stagflation; attempts to strong arm the Federal Reserve into cuts in interest rates; an even bigger crisis for the heavily indebted poor countries that have borrowed in dollars; the further retreat of globalisation. And that’s not even taking into account the risk that the cold war with China could turn hot. Pressure was already mounting on Biden to withdraw from the race before the Pennsylvania shooting and he was already facing a tougher struggle than looked likely six months ago. Then the US was booming, but it is now slowing down and unemployment is on the rise. That’s never a good sign for incumbents in the Oval Office. That said, the US has been by far the best performing economy in the G7 since the end of the Covid pandemic. Inflation rose – as it did across the developed world – in 2021 and 2022, but not to the levels seen in Europe. Biden has delivered on infrastructure and provided a boost to manufacturing, and the subsidies contained in the Inflation Reduction Act represent a more interventionist industrial strategy designed to stimulate green growth. He has delivered for working Americans. However, Biden has the same problem that Rishi Sunak had during the UK general election: voters feel poorer even though they are better off. In the half-dozen or so swing states that will decide who wins in November Trump is ahead. These are not insurmountable leads and in normal circumstances a sitting president would still be reasonably confident of victory at this stage of the campaign. These, though, are not normal times. Trump has been successful in convincing large numbers of voters that the US is doing worse than it actually is. Indeed, he spotted the potential to tap into the discontent of hollowed-out middle America long before his political opponents did. That sense of decline lives on, especially among Republicans. Americans are far more positive about the state of their own finances than they are about the economy in general. The fact that growth is now slowing under the weight of higher interest rates makes it far harder for Biden to counter Trump’s narrative that things have taken a turn for the worse since he was defeated in 2020. The Fed now appears to be gearing up to cut interest rates in September but by then it may be too little, too late for Biden. The state of the economy is no longer Biden’s biggest problem. Sure, the latest unemployment figures showed the US jobless rate rising from 4% to 4.1% in June but by historical standards that is still low. What concerns voters is whether Biden is fit to be president right now, let alone for another four years, and the indications are that he is not. Mistaking Volodymyr Zelenskiy for Vladimir Putin at last week’s Nato summit was merely the latest damaging gaffe. Trump is not exactly a model of cogency either but that’s not the point. He appears to many Americans to be more capable than Biden, particularly after last month’s disastrous head-to-head debate. It boils down to this: would an alternative Democrat candidate be able to flip the campaign so that it focuses on the economic successes of the past four years rather than Biden’s frailty?

        "title": "Microsoft deal with AI startup to be investigated by UK competition watchdog",
        "content": "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched a full investigation into Microsoft’s deal with AI startup Inflection. Earlier this year, Mustafa Suleyman – who started Inflection in January 2022, two months after leaving Google – and a number of his colleagues were hired by Microsoft to lead the tech company’s new AI division. At the same time, Microsoft signed deals with Inflection to access its AI models. The arrangement was criticised by regulators at the time as it avoided the regulatory attention of an outright acquisition. In April, the UK regulator said it was “considering whether it is or may be the case that the transaction has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger”, and opened a three-month comment period. It now has enough evidence to begin a full investigation, it said, with a decision on whether to progress to the next stage due by 11 September. A Microsoft spokesperson said: “We are confident that the hiring of talent promotes competition and should not be treated as a merger. We will provide the UK Competition and Markets Authority with the information it needs to complete its inquiries expeditiously.” An Inflection spokesperson said: “Inflection AI is moving rapidly to implement our new enterprise product and strategy while continuing to support our core technology platform. While we don’t want ongoing regulatory inquiries to become a distraction to our commercial focus, we are happy to cooperate with the authorities in their investigation of Microsoft.” At the time of the Microsoft and Inflection AI tie-up, the EU antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, said: “We have registered that this is happening and also registering that it’s happening in a way so that it escapes our scrutiny from our usual boxes.” The CMA’s move comes amid broader concerns about competition in the AI sector. Another deal involving Microsoft and French AI startup Mistral was investigated by the CMA at the same time as the Inflection inquiry, though the regulator later dropped its investigation. A deal between Amazon and AI lab Anthropic is also being investigated by the CMA as a potential merger. Anthropic has committed to using Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider, while Amazon has taken a $4bn (£3.1bn) stake in the company, which develops the Claude LLM (large language model). Meanwhile, ChatGPT maker OpenAI took a substantial investment from Microsoft in 2019. This was paid in part in credits for its cloud computing service. Last week, Microsoft dropped its “observer” seat on the board of OpenAI. Instead, Microsoft and Apple, which had been about to take up a similar role, will attend “regular stakeholder meetings”, an OpenAI spokesperson said. The CMA is also investigating the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, after the former took a substantial stake in the latter’s for-profit arm. OpenAI once described the stake as making Microsoft the “minority owner” but this was quietly updated to note the company simply had a “minority economic interest”.",

        "title": "Southern Water boss handed £183,000 bonus despite huge rise in bills",
        "content": "The chief executive of Southern Water has received a £183,000 bonus despite submitting a business plan that has been criticised by the industry regulator and attempting to raise bills more than any other English water company. Lawrence Gosden received the bonus as part of a £764,000 pay package, up from £428,000 a year earlier, according to the company’s annual report. Southern Water, which serves 2.5 million customers across south-east England, had proposed to raise water bills by 73% to £727 under its five-year business plan to 2030. Last week, the regulator, Ofwat, said the plan “fell short” of minimum expectations and categorised it as “inadequate”. However, it still provisionally allowed a bill increase from £420 to £603, the biggest rise in the country as the company tries to raise funds to fix leaky infrastructure. Including inflation, the increase is even higher – from £451 to £722. Gosden was appointed during the pandemic, in May 2020, to turn around struggling Southern, replacing Ian McAulay who had told MPs he would swim in the rivers and sea amid criticism over sewage dumping. Gosden has worked in the water industry for more than three decades. The report showed the finance chief, Stuart Ledger, received £610,000 – including a £128,000 bonus – up from the £170,000 package he received the previous year, when he joined shortly before the end of the financial year. Ofwat is belatedly attempting to crack down on bonuses paid out in the water industry, as suppliers face anger from the public and MPs over the release of raw sewage into waterways, company debt levels, the dividends paid out, and executive pay. The chief executive of struggling Thames Water, Chris Weston, this month defended his bonus of £195,000 for his first three months in charge. In response to Gosden’s bonus, first reported by the Financial Times, the former Undertones singer turned water campaigner Feargal Sharkey posted on X: “See this is how it works. Publish an ‘inadequate’ business plan, persuade the regulator to allow you to increase customers’ bills by 60% over the next 5 years and you get a £764,000 salary including a £183,000 bonus. ‘Trebles all round.’” Southern Water said Gosden and Ledger had hit targets for improving water quality, reducing pollution and cutting customer complaints. However, they missed goals for leakage, sewer flooding, customer experience and cash management. “This bonus will not be paid for from customers’ bills and will be borne by shareholders,” the company said. Southern, which supplies water to customers across a large stretch of south-east England from Hampshire to Kent, as well as the Isle of Wight, said Gosden and Ledger declined to take a bonus for the year before. Southern remains subject to enforcement monitoring after a record £126m fine in 2019. On Tuesday, Ofwat broadened its investigation into wastewater management across the industry. In 2021, Southern received a £1bn cash injection to save it from possible renationalisation. It is majority owned by the Australian investor Macquarie, which has been criticised for its stewardship of Thames Water. Last weekend, a £1.2bn scheme for Southern to recycle effluent from the sewage system in Hampshire and turn it into drinking water was called costly and a threat to the environment. A spokesperson for Southern Water said: “Having declined a bonus last year, Southern Water’s chief executive and chief financial officer will receive a partial bonus in 2024, paid by shareholders rather than from customer’s bills, after the board’s remuneration committee acknowledged progress made in delivering on the company’s ambitious turnaround plan. “Despite the region’s wettest year on record, the committee highlighted significant advances in treated water quality, a reduction in overall pollution numbers, and falling customer complaints, but also recognised areas where further progress is needed.”",

        "content": "Any prospects of the Fed pushing through a July rate cut has likely quashed by the better-than-expected US retail data, which was unchanged in June (despite forecasts for a 0.3% drop). However, comments by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell are still reverberating, after he hinted that the Fed won’t necessarily wait to see its 2% inflation target met before pulling the trigger on rate cuts. That has bolstered expectations that a rate cutting cycle could start in September. Back in the UK, grocery inflation has continued to ease, with price growth having fallen to 1.6% over the 4 weeks to 7 July, the lowest level since September 2021. Our other main stories: Thanks for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow morning frm 8am. –KM Major US indexes are bucking the global trend and have opened higher at the start of trading: S&amp;P 500 is up 0.28% at 5,647 points Dow is up 0.55% at 40,433 points Nasdaq is up 0.3% at 18,538 points The global economy faces the prospect of interest rates being higher for longer unless there is more progress in reducing service sector inflation, the International Monetary Fund has warned. While the Washington-based IMF nudged up its 2024 growth forecasts for the UK and the eurozone, it identified the stickiness of price growth in the service sector as a potential headache for central banks. The IMF did not single out the UK by name but its blanket warning chimes with comments from Bank of England policymakers about the risks of service sector inflation becoming embedded. Since the start of the year the headline rate of UK inflation has halved to 2% while service sector inflation has fallen from 6.5% to 5.7%. The Office for National Statistics will release the latest cost of living figures on Wednesday. A stronger than expected start to 2024 has resulted in the IMF raising its growth estimate for the UK from 0.5% to 0.7%, while the eurozone was upgraded from 0.8% to 0.9%. Read more here: Mohamed El-Erian, the president of Queens’ College at the University of Cambridge (as well as a former IMF deputy director and ex-chief economic adviser at Allianz) says the US retail sales data print will dampen hopes that the Fed might move to cut interest rates at their next meeting on 30-31 July. He said on X: BREAKING: US retail sales have avoided a forecasted decline, remaining unchanged in June despite predictions for a 0.3% drop. The US Census Bureau said adjusted estimates showed US retail and food sales were virtually unchanged from the previous month, and up 2.3% compared to a year earlier. The better-than-expected data has extended gains for US stock futures: S&amp;P 500 futures are up 0.23% Dow Jones futures are up 0.29% Nasdaq futures are up 0.28% Oil prices have tumbled, having been hit by concerns of a further economic slowdown in China. The price of Brent crude is down 1.7% at about $83.42 It comes after official figures released yesterday showed the Chinese economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter – much weaker than the 5.1% expected by the financial markets. While European indexes remain firmly in the red (the FTSE 100 is now down 0.5%), US futures are pointing to further gains for American-listed stocks this afternoon: S&amp;P 500 futures are up 0.16% Dow Jones futures are up 0.13% Nasdaq futures are up 0.23% It’s a mixed result from major US lenders Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, which are the last Wall Street giants to report Q2 results. A rebound in investment banking activity sent Morgan Stanley’s second quarter profits up a whopping 40% to $3.1bn in the three months to 30 June, up from $2.2bn a year earlier. It follows a boost in fees from investment banking activity, including M&amp;A, debt sales and stock offerings, following a two-year downturn for the wider industry caused by high borrowing costs and economic uncertainty. Revenue at Morgan Stanley’s investment banking division jumped 51% in the quarter to $1.6bn. But it was a much different results from Bank of America, which was hit by a drop in net interest income, as well as the amount of money it had to put aside for potential defaults. Net interest income (NII), which accounts for the difference between what is paid out for deposits versus what is earned from loans, fell 3% to $13.7bn in the quarter, while provisions for bad debts rose to $1.5bn from $1.1bn a year earlier. It contributed to a 6.7% decline in profits to $6.9bn. Tesla is embarking on a hiring spree that could see it onboard 800 new employees just three months after CEO Elon Musk triggered the largest round of layoffs in the company’s history. Analysis by Bloomberg (paywall) shows that the jobs, which have steadily showed up on Tesla’s career page in recent weeks, range from AI specialists to basic service roles. The jump in hires is likely to bring staff back into parts of the business where Tesla made too deep of cuts, but also reflects Musk’s plan to focus the business on AI, robotics and sustainable energy. It emerged in April that Tesla was laying off 14,000 staff, or around 10% of its global workforce, amid slow consumer demand and price pressure. Tesla said it had made approximately 387,000 deliveries to customers in the first quarter of 2024, missing market expectations by about 13%. It was its first fall in deliveries in nearly four years. The company cited production problems caused by unforeseen factors such as attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and an arson attack on its factory in Berlin, but the figures also pointed to a softening in global demand. Cineworld has reportedly launched talks with its commercial landlords, including Landsec and Legal &amp; General, about plans to cut a quarter of its cinemas in Britain as part of a restructure plan. Sky News is reporting that the property owners, which together own about 30 of its multiplexes, are in active discussions with Cineworld ahead of a hearing about its restructuring. It is seeking rent reductions at 50 sites, and is hoping to convince a majority of creditors to approve its proposals to shut 25 sites. A number of landlords are said to be considering opposing the proposals, according to Sky. However, it is unclear whether that would be in sufficient number to block the restructuring plan. It’s a sea of red across major indexes this morning, and while the FTSE 100 has pared some of its losses since the start of trading – having opened down 0.4% – it is still down 0.18%. London’s blue chip index has been dragged down by Burberry (-3.5%) after yesterday’s profit warning and the shock departure of its CEO, as well as Rio Tinto (-3.2%), following a disappointing trading update. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said Burberry extended yesterday’s losses as investors continued to lose patience with the luxury goods company. While it is getting a new boss this week, the scale of the challenge to fix the business looks large. On miner Rio Tinto, he added: Rio Tinto disappointed with its latest production update, with iron ore the biggest worry area after a weak quarter for output. Experian’s update was generally fine but didn’t deliver the earnings upgrades needed to justify its premium stock rating, leaving investors a tad miffed. It also didn’t help that chief operating officer Craig Boundy handed in his notice as he’s got a new job running McAfee. Water companies Severn Trent and United Utilities are also weighing on the FTSE 100, with investors selling off their stock after regulator Ofwat said it was investigating the firms over sewage spills. Ocado CEO Tim Steiner held a media call this morning, after upgrading guidance at its technology arm, which sells warehouse robots to other retailers around the world. While technology revenues climbed by almost 22% in the six months to 2 June, there have been concerns that clients, such as the Canadian supermarket Sobeys and Kroger in the US, were pausing the rollout of robotic warehouses. Steiner explained that clients had based their rollout plans on trends seen during the Covid pandemic, when online shopping surged, but then fell back as shops reopened. He brushed off investor concerns, saying “we expect to see a lot of long-term growth,” and added that the global shift to online shopping had resumed. Steiner also said consumer sentiment was also improving, amid further easing of price inflation: It’s definitely improved. Consumers are in a better position than they were this time about a year ago, when it felt like everything was constantly moving up at crazy levels, other than people’s incomes. Grocery inflation is running at 1.6% now, below average wage rises. “Obviously consumers are still feeling the pinch”, Steiner added. Commenting on whether Ocado would keep its stock market listing in the UK, he said: The London market can be tough for some companies. Obviously, we’ve got a very strong retail presence here in the UK with Ocado Retail, it’s a natural place for that business to be listed. In the long term future as a global tech company, could you consider other markets? You could but we’re actually really focused at the moment on serving our clients well… And those efforts are really where we’re focusing our time and not on where we’re listed. Steiner reckons that there is still demand for Ocado’s fast-delivery service Zoom, despite the demise of rivals such as Getir and Gorillas. He said: “I do think that there is demand for ultra fast services.” Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky has told the BBC he is committed to the Royal Mail’s obligation to deliver letters across the UK six days a week, if he succeeds in his £3.6bn takeover of the business. That differs from what has been put in writing, with Kretinsky having previously committed to honouring the so-called Universal Service Obligation, but only for five years. Theoretically, that could mean the prospective new owner could walk away after that period. But in an exclusive interview with the BBC, Kretinsky said: As long as I’m alive, I completely exclude this, and I’m sure that anybody that would be my successor would absolutely understand this. I say this as an absolutely clear, unconditional commitment: Royal Mail is going to be the provider of Universal Service Obligation in the UK, I would say forever, as long as the service is going to be needed, and as long as we are going to be around. Kretinsky explained that the five-year written commitment was “the longest commitment that has ever been offered in a situation like this”. Shareholders are expected to greenlight the deal in a vote held on 25 September. Though the government also has a say over whether it goes ahead, meaning Kretinsky’s written and verbal obligations are likely to come under further scrutiny. US retail sales due out this afternoon could bolster hopes for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank says: Retail sales in the US are expected to have fallen 0.2% in June. Such weakness would back the Fed’s easing inflation story and further reinforce the expectation of a September Fed cut. That is likely to add fuel to Fed chair Jerome Powell’s comments that inflation need not fall to 2% before cutting rates. Some good news for Ocado that sent its shares surging 18% this morning. The online-only retailer upgraded its annual guidance, saying its key tech solutions division would achieve “mid-teens” EBITDA margins in the current financial year. That is up from previous guidance of over 10%. Kantar data also showed Ocado remained the fastest growing grocer for the fifth month running, with sales up 10.7% over the 12 weeks to 7 July. It now has a hold on 1.8% of the market, up 0.1 percentage points compared with the same period last year. That was faster than discounter Lidle, which saw a 7.8% jump in sales, taking its market share to 8.1%. Ocado shares jumped as much as 18% at the start of trading, and are now up a slightly less exuberant (but still impressive) 11%. That’s good news for a stock that had lost about 55% of its value so far this year. The water regulator for England and Wales is taking action against four more water companies including Severn Trent and United Utilities over sewage spills, just days after being accused of showing “contempt” to customers over the latest water bill price rises. Ofwat said it had served formal notices on Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water, Hafren Dyfrdwy, Severn Trent and United Utilities asking them to provide evidence for its investigation into companies’ wastewater management in England and Wales. The regulator has looked at the firms’ environmental performance and data about how often they spill from storm overflows. It said this had heightened its “concerns that these companies may not be fulfilling their obligations to protect the environment and minimise pollution”. This means Ofwat is now taking enforcement action against all 11 water and wastewater companies in England and Wales over sewage pollution. Once it has fully investigated, it will publish its findings and where appropriate take action over any breaches of legal obligations. Investigations into Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, South West Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water began two years ago and are ongoing. Southern Water remains subject to enforcement monitoring after a record £126m fine in 2019 over “shocking” failures at the company’s sewage treatment sites that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England. Read more here: Grocery inflation has dropped to its lowest level since September 2021, according to fresh data from market research firm Kantar. Food inflation fell 1.6% in the four weeks to July 7, down from 2.1%, with toilet tissues, dog food and butter accounting for the largest fall in prices over the period. However, prices have continued to rise for items including vitamins, supplements, fruit juices and deodorants. But overall, falling price inflation helped fuel sales of branded products by 3.6%, outpacing grocery stores’ own-label products, which grew at 2.7%. Easing price growth also coincided with the fastest rise in monthly footfall so far in 2024. People made 2% more trips to the supermarket over the four-week period than they did a year earlier, Kantar said. And, of course, the men’s Euros football tournament helped fuel purchases of beers crisps and snacks on match days though low alcohol beer sales soared on weekdays as Britons celebrated in relative moderation. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: England’s hopes might have been dashed on Sunday, but there was still some cause for celebration in the grocery industry. Football fans drove beer sales up by an average of 13% on the days that the England men’s team played, compared with the same day during the previous week. Sales of crisps and snacks also got a boost, up by 5% compared with the month before. With many matches played on “school nights”, though, some Britons chose moderation. Spending on no and low-alcohol beer soared by 38% on matchdays. European markets are open for trading and major indexes are all in the red this morning: EUROPE’S STOXX 600 DOWN 0.5% GERMANY’S DAX DOWN 0.6% BRITAIN’S FTSE 100 DOWN 0.4% FRANCE’S CAC 40 DOWN 0.6% SPAIN’S IBEX DOWN 0.7% EURO STOXX INDEX DOWN 0.6%, EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS DOWN 0.6% Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. The long wait for US interest rate cuts could soon be over. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has dropped hints that the central bank will not need to see inflation hit its 2% target before cutting interest rates. Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington DC, Powell said: The implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you’ve probably waited too long, because the tightening that you’re doing, or the level of tightness that you have, is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%. Instead, he explained that policymakers are looking for “greater confidence” that price inflation is striding towards that figure: What increases that confidence in that is more good inflation data, and lately here we have been getting some of that. Traders are currently betting on at least two rate cuts before the end of 2024, starting in September. That could result in a drop in the main federal funds rate, from its current range of 5.25% to 5.50%. Fed policy makers are next set to meet on July 30-31, though they are expected to hold interest rates steady.

        "content": "The UK faces the prospect of interest rates being higher for longer unless there is more progress in reducing service sector inflation, the International Monetary Fund has warned. While the Washington-based IMF nudged up its 2024 growth forecasts for the UK, it identified the stickiness of price growth in the service sector as a potential headache for the Bank of England. The IMF’s economic counsellor, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said the UK was similar to the US in having “somewhat persistent services inflation”. His comments chime with comments from Bank of England policymakers about the risks of service sector inflation becoming embedded. Since the start of the year the headline rate of UK inflation has halved to 2% while service sector inflation has fallen from 6.5% to 5.7%. The Office for National Statistics will release the latest cost of living figures on Wednesday. The IMF said its forecasts for the global economy had not changed much since the release of its world economic outlook (WEO) in April. Its July WEO update left 2024 growth unchanged at 3.2%, while its estimate for 2025 was revised up from 3.2% to 3.3%. A stronger than expected start to 2024 has resulted in the IMF raising its growth estimate for the UK from 0.5% to 0.7%, while the eurozone was upgraded from 0.8% to 0.9%. The fund believes UK growth will continue to pick up and has pencilled in expansion of 1.5% in 2025. Elsewhere, the IMF said the growth gap between the US and the EU would narrow over the next 18 months. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said: “While it’s welcome that the IMF is forecasting growth to pick up this time, I am under no illusion to the scale of the challenge facing the economy and the inheritance this new government faces. That is why we are already taking the tough decisions to fix the foundations of our economy, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of our country better off.” While the IMF believes the global economy is on course for a slowdown but not a recession it said the service sector cost pressures were holding up progress in the fight to bring inflation down sustainably. “As in April, we project global inflation will slow to 5.9% this year from 6.7% last year, broadly on track for a soft landing,” Gourinchas said. “But in some advanced economies, especially the US, progress on disinflation has slowed, and risks are to the upside.” Risks of persistent inflation in the services sector were tied to wage and price setting, given that labour accounted for a high share of the costs in that sector. The service sector accounts for about 80% of the UK economy’s output. “Persistently elevated uncertainty around the inflation outlook has led central banks in major advanced economies to become somewhat more cautious about the pace of policy easing, compared with their positions at the end of the first quarter,” the IMF said. The IMF also expressed concern about the potential for significant swings in economic policy as a result of elections this year, with knock-on effects to the rest of the world. Without singling out any country, Gourinchas said he was worried about mounting protectionism. “The gradual dismantling of our multilateral trading system is another key concern. More countries are now going their own way, imposing unilateral tariffs or industrial policy measures whose compliance with World Trade Organization rules is questionable at best,” Gourinchas said. “Our imperfect trading system could be improved, but this surge in unilateral measures isn’t likely to deliver lasting and shared global prosperity. If anything, it will distort trade and resource allocation, spur retaliation, weaken growth, diminish living standards, and make it harder to coordinate policies that address global challenges, such as the climate transition.”",

        "content": "Shortly before Christmas 1997, Tracy Blackwell found herself in New York with nothing but two suitcases and the sinking feeling that she would have to make another fresh start. At 30, she had just moved there from London with her employer, Goldman Sachs. And while she safely made it stateside, a transatlantic cargo ship had capsized off the Azores, taking all her worldly possessions with it. “You can look back and laugh, but at the time … you don’t know where to start,” Blackwell says. But the US native was more than up to starting from scratch. Back in the UK since the early years of this century, she has risen to chief executive of the London-based Pension Insurance Corporation (PIC), a City firm that helps companies offload the risks of their final salary pension schemes. Since its founding in 2006, PIC has become a market leader in defined benefit pension buyouts, managing the retirement schemes of more than 339,900 policyholders employed by companies including M&amp;S, De Beers and Cadbury. As a major investor with, managing assets of £46.8bn, PIC – and Blackwell, who sits on Labour’s British infrastructure council – has the ear of the new government, as chancellor Rachel Reeves seeks to attract cash for her national wealth fund (NWF), launched last week. This is a kind of power Blackwell never expected to hold. Born in the US rustbelt to a single mother aged just 18, she did not have an easy start. But Blackwell did not intend to stay in Rockford, Illinois, long. “I was in the catchment area for the best high school and I was one of the poorest ones there,” Blackwell says. “I realised that I wanted to do something and I wasn’t going to succeed living in Rockford.” So with money saved from an after-school job scooping ice-cream at Baskin-Robbins, she jumped on a plane to tour Europe. It was a transformative experience for the 17-year-old, whose only previous travel experience was a trip to Hawaii won in a breakfast cereal competition five years earlier. In 1985, as a way of keeping her options open, she enrolled in the University of Illinois’s Gies College of Business. But while working 80-hour weeks – including a stint as a magician’s assistant – to fund her studies, Blackwell was inspired by a finance professor to pursue an interest in financial markets. “I love markets, because it’s everything. It’s how an individual business is running, it’s geopolitics, it’s national politics, it’s the news … It’s the living embodiment of what’s going on in the world. And that’s what I found fascinating.” After doing an MBA, she clinched an interview with Goldman Sachs in London. Passed over for a role in investment banking (she was later told she did not have the right “pedigree”), Blackwell was offered a job in the burgeoning derivatives industry, trading futures contracts, options and swaps, which had been invented just a year earlier. Blackwell, 56, gets a glint in her eye when she talks about those early years at Goldman, where she eventually moved into asset management. But then came the bank’s IPO in 1999. “The whole culture changed. It became much more ruthless, and less like a family,” Blackwell says. She left the City altogether and move to Norfolk with her husband as she considered her next move. In 2004, she was lured back to finance by former Goldman colleague Danny Truell, who had since become chief investment officer at the Wellcome Trust. Danny and his brother, Eddie, had watched the UK’s 2004 pension reforms with interest. Companies suddenly had to make ironclad guarantees to pay final salary pensions, having previously only paid out if financial conditions allowed. With pension schemes turning into hard liabilities on balance sheets, and requiring more funding every year, companies started closing and offloading those schemes to professional investors that could fund and manage them properly. The Truells saw an opportunity. They pitched the idea to Goldman, which turned them down only to start its own rival, Rothesay, a year later. Blackwell’s interest was piqued and she joined what would become PIC, which made money through surplus returns on long-term investments, including in infrastructure such as universities, renewable energy and social housing. After the 2007-08 financial crisis, PIC started striking pension deals, first with an engineering firm called Swan Hill. Other notable buyouts included a £660m deal with Cadbury and a £1.2bn deal with EMI, for which Blackwell’s team went head to head with Goldman. Blackwell has worked her way to the top of PIC, which now manages assets worth nearly £50bn. She has about £12bn invested in UK infrastructure, a figure both she and the Labour party would like to see grow. Newly installed ministers are hoping to jump-start investment, by getting rid of red tape through planning reforms and by spreading the risk though Reeves’s NWF, which aims to raise £3 in private cash for every £1 of state money put into projects including ports, gigafactories, hydrogen and steel. “If it works, brilliant,” Blackwell says. “It is imperative we get growth going. There is no question the planning system is holding it up.” There are wider bureaucratic problems, too, she says, particularly the way projects need approval from a wide array of arm’s-length public bodies. Her solution is to ensure that all such bodies have a “growth mantra”, and to offer businesses an easy way to bring frustrating delays to central government’s notice. “There’s a lot of really good ideas out there,” Blackwell says. “Some of this stuff just needs to be brought to the government’s attention faster, and they need to do something about it faster. If you’re an investor, you’re not gonna wait for three years to do anything. You’re gonna go somewhere else, because we can invest globally.” CV Age 56 Family Married with one son.

        "title": "Ocado shares jump as it narrows losses and boosts technology business",
        "content": "Shares in Ocado jumped by as much as 18% after the UK online grocer reported narrowing losses and raised its annual guidance for its technology arm, which sells warehouse robots to other retailers around the world. Technology revenues climbed by nearly 22% year on year in the six months to 2 June, while retail revenues were also up by 11%. Ocado sells groceries in the UK through its joint venture with Marks &amp; Spencer and was the fastest-growing grocer for the fifth month in a row based on recent sales figures, according to the data analytics company Kantar. Ocado now expects its tech division to achieve a “mid-teens” Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin this year, up from previous guidance of more than 10%. The company’s overall pre-tax loss in the first half of the year narrowed to £154m, from £290m a year earlier. This reassured investors, and drove Ocado shares sharply higher. The stock closed up 8% at 368.1p but hit 409.1p earlier in the day. The share price has lost 47% this year amid concerns that some clients, such as the Canadian supermarket Sobeys and Kroger in the US, are pausing the rollout of robotic warehouses. Tim Steiner, Ocado’s chief executive, explained that clients had based their plans on trends seen during the Covid pandemic when online shopping surged – but then fell back as shops reopened. He said the global shift to online shopping had resumed and brushed off investor concerns, saying: “We expect to see a lot of long-term growth.” With grocery inflation slowing sharply from last year’s double-digit increases, consumer sentiment has been rising. Steiner said: “It’s definitely improved. Consumers are in a better position than they were this time about a year ago, when it felt like everything was constantly moving up at crazy levels, other than people’s incomes.” He noted that grocery inflation is now running at 1.6%, according to Kantar, below average wage rises. But he added: “Obviously consumers are still feeling the pinch.” Commenting on whether Ocado would keep its stock market listing in the UK, he said: “The London market can be tough for some companies. Obviously, we’ve got a very strong retail presence here in the UK with Ocado Retail, it’s a natural place for that business to be listed. “In the long-term future as a global tech company, could you consider other markets? You could but we’re actually really focused at the moment on serving our clients well … And those efforts are really where we’re focusing our time and not on where we’re listed.” Steiner reckons that there is still demand for Ocado’s fast-delivery service Zoom, despite the demise of rivals such as Getir and Gorillas. He said: “I do think that there is demand for ultra-fast services.”",

        "content": "Falling inflation, football fans and fake tan drove supermarket shopping in recent weeks, when improving consumer confidence and excitement around the men’s Euros tournament were only slightly dampened by wet weather. Sales at supermarkets increased by 2.2% year on year over the four weeks to 7 July, with football fans driving up purchases of beers, crisps and snacks on match days. Grocery price inflation has fallen to 1.6% this month from June’s 2.1%, marking the lowest level since September 2021, according to retail analysts Kantar. That drop coincided with the fastest rise in monthly footfall so far this year, with Britons making 2% more trips to the supermarket than a year earlier. Excitement built as England made it to the Euros final, but were beaten by Spain 2-1 on Sunday night, dashing hopes of an end to 58 years without a major trophy. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: “England’s hopes might have been dashed on Sunday, but there was still some cause for celebration in the grocery industry. “Football fans drove beer sales up by an average of 13% on the days that the England men’s team played, compared with the same day during the previous week.” With most England matches played on “school nights”, many people opted for no or low-alcohol beer, with sales up by 38% on match days. The soggy summer weather boosted sales of artificial tan by 16%, while cold and flu medicine sales jumped by 35%, and dampened demand for sun cream, with sales down 10% compared with last year, when the UK enjoyed the warmest June on record. During the cost of living crisis consumers have switched to supermarkets’ cheaper own-label items but this trend has now reversed, with sales of branded products rising by 3.6%, outpacing own-label groceries at 2.7%. Before the king’s speech on Wednesday, which will set out the newly elected government’s legislative agenda for grocers and other sectors, McKevitt said: “The retail landscape looks very different from 2010 when the last Labour government was in power – and so do our shopping trolleys. “As diets have evolved, sales of popcorn, peanut butter and chilled vegetarian products, such as sausages and grills, have more than trebled. We’re also more likely to have premium ground and bean coffee in our cups now.” Ocado was the fastest-growing grocer for the fifth month in a row, with sales up by 10.7% over the 12 weeks to 7 July giving it a 1.8% market share. The discounter Lidl posted a 7.8% jump in sales, bringing its share of the market to 8.1%, while fellow budget retailer Aldi’s market share is 10%. Waitrose gained market share for the first time since January 2022, edging 0.1 percentage point higher to 4.5%, as spending at the upmarket grocer increased by 3.3%. Britain’s largest supermarket chain, Tesco, achieved its biggest gain in share since November 2021, taking 27.7% of the market, a 0.7 percentage point increase compared with last year.",

        "title": "UK ready to build ‘closer, more mature’ trade links with EU",
        "content": "Britain is taking its first steps towards forging closer trading links with the EU in meetings between the new business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and international counterparts in Italy. In his first overseas visit since Labour’s election landslide, Reynolds will tell a G7 meeting of trade ministers in the Italian city of Reggio Calabria that the new UK government wants to foster a “closer, more mature relationship with our friends in the EU”. Aiming to reset relations after a volatile period under successive Conservative administrations since the 2016 Brexit vote, he is expected to tell international ministers that Britain is “back on the world stage and ‘open for business’”. Reynolds will add: “We are seeking a closer, more mature, more level-headed relationship with our friends in the European Union – our nearest and largest trading partner, and we also intend to forge better trading relationships with countries around the world.” The meetings come as Keir Starmer tries to build closer links with Brussels by hosting EU leaders at Blenheim Palace near Oxford on Thursday, as part of a one-day European Political Community summit. The prime minister is attempting to walk a tightrope between strengthening EU relations while also telling voters that his government will not take Britain back into the single market or customs union. Starmer is instead relying on more modest reforms and a warmer tone with Brussels. The prime minister insisted during the election campaign that the UK would not rejoin the EU within his lifetime. Instead, Labour committed in its manifesto to building stronger trade and investment links with the 27-nation bloc, including through a veterinary agreement, support for touring artists, and mutual recognition deals for professional qualifications. The EU accounted for 41% of UK exports of goods and services and 52% of imports in 2023. Business leaders have urged Starmer to forge closer links with Brussels given the importance of the EU market to UK companies, while also calling for looser migration rules to give them more access to EU workers. Under the terms of the Brexit deal finalised by Boris Johnson’s government in late December 2020, and in force since January 2021, the UK and the EU are committed to reviewing the implementation of the agreement every five years, with Starmer expected to oversee the first such process in 2026. Some commentators have suggested the review could pose an opportunity for the deal to be renegotiated. However, EU officials have argued the process may only offer limited scope for change. Reynolds is expected on Tuesday to hold his first in-person meetings with G7 counterparts since his appointment earlier this month, including with the vice-president of the EU Commission Valdis Dombrovskis and the German vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck. The new government is hoping a “reset” of international relations will bolster Britain’s status among global businesses and investors, as part of efforts to secure the highest sustained rate of economic growth in the G7. It also comes amid rising geopolitical tensions and political uncertainty elsewhere. The US president, Joe Biden, appeared last week to back Starmer’s ambitions for closer EU ties, telling the prime minister in talks at the White House that this would also strengthen the transatlantic alliance with Washington.",

        "title": "Labour donor Dale Vince has libel case against Daily Mail thrown out",
        "content": "The millionaire Labour donor Dale Vince’s £100,000 libel case against the Daily Mail has been thrown out after a high court judge ruled it did not have a realistic chance of success. The green energy businessman and Forest Green Rovers chairman claimed the newspaper libelled him in a June 2023 article titled “Labour repays £100,000 to ‘sex harassment’ donor”. The Daily Mail article was about an entirely separate Labour donor called Davide Serra, who was said to be “a high-flying City financier accused of sex harassment”. The article included a photograph of Vince in his capacity as another high-profile Labour donor who had been the subject of press attention after attending a Just Stop Oil protest in Westminster. Vince’s lawyers accepted that anyone who read the entire article “would appreciate very quickly that he was not the person being accused of sexual harassment”. However, they claimed the Daily Mail had defamed Vince by innuendo, by putting a picture of him under a headline about a Labour donor being accused of sexual harassment. They said an ordinary reader would assume a headline and picture contained accurate information and “they did not need to read any further than to understand what the article was saying”. Associated Newspapers, the Daily Mail’s parent company, said the case was without merit as case law in England and Wales did not allow a headline and picture to be considered in isolation from the rest of the text. The company said a hypothetical reader, in the eyes of the law, would have read the whole piece and “readers who read only part of an article are not reasonable readers”. They successfully cited a precedent set in a 1995 legal case involving the News of the World and the actors who played Harold and Madge Bishop in the television soap Neighbours. The tabloid had published an article under the headline “Strewth! What’s Harold up to with our Madge?” accompanied by a photograph seemingly showing the two actors having sex. The text of the article later made it clear that the photographs had been produced by the makers of a “sordid” pornographic video game by superimposing the faces on to graphic images. The lords who ruled on the case described the News of the World article as “gutter journalism” that had caused great offence. However, they concluded that for the purposes of libel law, it must be assumed that an ordinary person would read beyond the headline and take in all the nuances of an article. Judge Jaron Lewis concluded that this principle applied to Vince’s case against the Daily Mail, meaning the headline and picture could not be considered in isolation from the rest of the article. As a result, he concluded that Vince’s case was “bound to fail” and could not proceed to trial. Vince said he would seek to appeal against the judge’s decision in an attempt to overturn the legal precedent, arguing that it did not reflect the reality of how people consume the news. He said: “A substantial number of people only read headlines and would have thus been given an entirely false impression. As it stands the Daily Mail can get away with this kind of personal smear – I’m trying to change that.” Vince, who gave millions to Labour in the run-up to the general election, is also suing the rightwing Guido Fawkes blog, the Reform UK MP Richard Tice and the former Conservative mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey over comments they made about Vince’s views on Hamas. Paul Staines, the editor of Guido Fawkes, has always hosted his blog offshore to minimise legal threats. He has now said he will give up these protections and fight the case.",

        "content": "Goldman Sachs has increased banker pay including bonuses by 17% after profits more than doubled in the second quarter, following a rebound in dealmaking. The Wall Street firm said it spent $4.2bn (£3.2bn) on compensation and benefits for its 45,300 staff in the three months to June, up almost a fifth from the same period last year. That figure accounts for salaries and pensions, as well as the amount being put aside for individual bonuses that are distributed at the end of the financial year. Overall, Goldman has spent $8.8bn on compensation and benefits for staff since January, which the bank said reflected “improved operating performance”. Financial filings show that Goldman’s profits surged 150% to $3bn in the second quarter, up from $1.2bn last year. Profits were boosted by a jump in business deals, with its investment bankers helping guide firms through a fresh wave of mergers and takeovers. That includes ExxonMobil’s $60bn takeover of Pioneer Natural Resources in May, for which Goldman acted as a broker alongside the rival banks Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. Goldman’s chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, said: “We are pleased with our solid second-quarter results and our overall performance in the first half of the year, reflecting strong year-on-year growth in both global banking and markets and asset and wealth management.” Investment bankers are emerging from a two-year slump in dealmaking, which was affected by high borrowing rates and economic uncertainty. A brighter economic outlook, as well as expectations that the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, has boosted demand for services from banks such as Goldman Sachs. That is likely to translate into larger bonuses, including for Goldman’s 6,000 UK staff, who will no longer be bound by a banker bonus cap that previously limited bonuses to twice the individual’s salary. The UK bonus cap was originally part of changes introduced after the 2007-08 banking crash, and aimed to stamp out a bonus culture blamed for encouraging short-term profits over longer-term stability. Prior to Labour’s general election victory, the incoming chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the party had no plans to reinstate the banker bonus cap. Richard Gnodde, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs International, announced in May that the bank would be changing its pay structure, giving hundreds of its highest-earning staff the ability to make 25 times their salaries in bonuses.",

        "title": "Burberry must end emphasis on shock factor and focus on being loved again",
        "content": "Burberry has blessings that other brands would kill for. Everyone knows what a Burberry trenchcoat is, and pretty much everyone would be thrilled to have one. Burberry is a household name at a time when shoppers buying luxuries prize a prestige brand more than anything else. It is one of the elite labels that have meaning in the world of power and status, not only fashion. In the trenchcoat – a perennial wardrobe classic – it owns prized real estate on the Monopoly board of luxury. (Consider how much mileage Gucci makes out of owning the loafer.) It has 168 years of heritage, and a bone-deep authenticity as the outfitter of Scott and Shackleton. It makes coats that last a lifetime, which chimes with modern values of sustainability. It stands for Britishness and quality. Success should, surely, be an open goal. Fashion is seldom that simple, however, and Burberry’s advantages are also its problems. It is a coat brand in a world where bags and shoes, not clothes, are cash cows. It is synonymous with Britishness, leaving it beached and disconnected from the continental powerhouses of Paris and Milan. Burberry’s fashion glory days were under the designer Christopher Bailey, who over the course of almost two decades transformed it from a reliable but dull coat maker into a style powerhouse. Bailey grabbed British cultural references that spoke to a broad audience – the Beatles, Princess Margaret, David Hockney, Marianne Faithfull – to create a look that was aspirational but accessible, classy without being snobbish. By packing his front rows with politicians and rappers, as well as actors and supermodels, he gave Burberry a context in culture. He popped the collar on the trenchcoat, streamlined it into a more flattering silhouette, and built out the colour palette from boring beige into soft neutrals. Bailey’s successors, the Italian designer Riccardo Tisci and, since 2022, the Yorkshire-born Daniel Lee, have attempted to take Burberry in a different direction – cooler, haughtier, edgier. Fickle consumers had grown tired of the cosy Burberry world that Bailey had built, and Tisci, who had enjoyed stellar success as a pioneer of luxury streetwear at Givenchy, believed he could bring the same magic to British shores. But neither Tisci nor Lee have found a way to join the dots between avant garde catwalk looks and what consumers want from Burberry. In recent seasons Burberry has taken the audience deliberately outside their comfort zone, with shows staged in huge tents in London parks with utilitarian stuffed bench seating and dark lighting. The vibe is one part explorers’ base camp, one part festival dance tent. The emphasis is on the shock – rather than the feelgood – factor. Burberry needs to create clothes – and, crucially, bags and shoes – that make fashion fall in love with the brand again. That the shake-up announced on Monday brings in Joshua Schulman – an alumnus of Coach and Michael Kors, the home of friendly-looking, accessible-level designer bags – as chief executive speaks to a change of direction. Lee is a highly talented designer, with an instinct for the zeitgeist that led to him transforming Bottega Veneta from a relatively obscure Milanese house into an Instagram sensation, before he took on Burberry. A trench with soft scallop edging, a rugged parka lined in a deep olive version of the Burberry check, a storm-collared leather jacket, are just three from a lineup of extremely desirable pieces in his most recent show. But in aiming for cool, his Burberry sometimes ends up feeling chilly and sullen. Warm reviews mean nothing if the people aren’t buying it. In fashion, the customer is always right.",

        "title": "Wall Street stocks rise after Donald Trump assassination attempt – as it happened",
        "content": "Shares in Donald Trump’s media company have surged to their highest point since mid-June in the opening minutes of trading on Wall Street, as investors bet that the attempted assassination of the former president will boost his chances of re-election. The share price of Trump Media and Technology Group soared as high as $46.27 on Monday morning in New York – before dropping back to $39. That was a steep 27% increase, although not quite the $50 mark that had been indicated in pre-market trading. The theory that traders appeared to be following was that the assassination attempt makes Trump’s election more likely in November, and that that would somehow increase earnings significantly from Truth Social, his rival network to X, formerly Twitter. But it was not just Trump-specific assets that gained ground. US markets also rose more broadly, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose to a new record high. Bob Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY Mellon, an investment bank, said: The narrative for the day rests on the “Trump Trade” with many investors assuming the weekend events add to the former president being re-elected. The logic being that the chances of tax cut extensions and higher trade tariffs – leading to even higher US fiscal deficits, even alongside potential growth headwinds and intense political pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease as inflation continues to subside near term. Some also suspect a possible withdrawal of US support for Ukraine would also up fiscal pressures in Europe, who may then have to pick up the funding for the war.

Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said: In a Republican administration, you’ll see a lower tax policy, lower regulatory policy... that’s typically good for stocks. We’re seeing some of that in terms of forward looking expectations from investors at this point. What will China do to try to hit its 5% annual growth target, given the slowdown revealed today? Duncan Wrigley, chief China+ economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said: President Xi Jinping today delivered a work report at the Third Plenum on deepening reform and promoting modernisation, with details yet to be released. The focus will probably be on promoting high-tech and manufacturing as the path to higher productivity and sustained growth in the longer term. Measures to encourage private-sector and foreign business investment are likely, but sweeping reforms to create a consumption-driven growth model, such as household residency reform or building a universal welfare system, are unlikely. The FTSE 100 is down by 0.3% in London. Burberry apart, some of the biggest fallers are miners, who have been hit by concerns over the Chinese economy. Mining company Antofagasta, whose speciality is copper, fell by 4.1%, while Anglo American fell by 2.1%. China is struggling to keep up the speed of its economy, as the property industry and consumption slow. Lynn Son, chief economist for Greater China at ING, an investment bank, said: The drag from the property market should come as no surprise. The actual drag on GDP growth will likely persist for an extended period of time, as even if prices bottom out, there is still a high level of inventories that need to be digested before new investment takes place. And that has hit consumption: A negative wealth effect from falling property and stock prices, as well as low wage growth amid various industries’ cost cutting, is dragging consumption and causing a pivot from big-ticket purchases toward a basic “eat drink and play” theme consumption. However, there was still demand from industry, which could help the Chinese economy weather the slump in spending: We continued to see strong growth in hi-tech manufacturing (8.8% YoY) and computer and electronic equipment manufacturing (11.3% YoY), which should remain a major area for growth as China prioritises its transition toward higher end manufacturing and establishing technological self-sufficiency. Pressure on Beijing to take steps to improve Chinese consumer confidence has intensified after news that weak retail spending dragged down the growth rate of the world’s second biggest economy. With falling house prices still acting as a drag on activity, official figures showed the Chinese economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter – much weaker than the 5.1% expected by the financial markets. Annual retail sales growth slowed from 3.2% to 2% in the three months ending in June – the weakest in 18 months – and fell slightly in June alone. You can read the full report here: We have had some economic updates on industry in Europe and the US. In Europe, industrial production data published this morning showed that output fell by 0.6% during May – less than the 0.8% expected by economists. Output over the course of the previous year was also revised up slightly, although it was still down by 2.9%. In the US, the New York Federal Reserve’s manufacturing survey showed activity slowing slightly – although it was better than expected. Goldman Sachs made profits of $3bn in the second quarter of 2024, more than double last year thanks to strong bond trading profits. The Wall Street bank’s revenues were $12.7bn for the second quarter of 2024, 17% higher than the second quarter of 2023, but 10% lower than the bumper first quarter of 2024 when it benefited from a surge in debt issues and some major mergers and acquisitions. Goldman’s share price is up by nearly a quarter so far in 2024, as investors appear to welcome a return to focusing on the investment banking that made it one of the best known names in US finance. Goldman had made a brief foray into consumer banking. The bank’s strong share price performance has benefited its bankers, whose shared bonus pot increased by 20% this year. David Solomon, Goldman’s chief executive, said: We are pleased with our solid second quarter results and our overall performance in the first half of the year, reflecting strong year-on-year growth in both global banking and markets and asset and wealth management. The Bank of England needs to “stop squeezing living standards” and cut interest rates, a senior policymaker has said. Swati Dhingra, a member of the central bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), said official borrowing costs should be cut at its next meeting on 1 August to ease pressure on households and businesses. Dhingra told the Rest is Money podcast: Now is the time to start normalising [interest rates], so that we can then finally stop squeezing living standards the way we have been to try and get inflation down. We are weighing on living standards and that cost does not need to be paid. Whether the Bank cuts borrowing costs in August for the first time since the Covid pandemic is thought to be on a knife-edge, with City investors pricing in a 50/50 chance of a cut from the current level of 5.25%. You can read the full report here: Shares in retail technology company Ocado have slumped by 11% after an investment broker downgraded its expectations. Ocado fell by 11.3% on Monday, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index. Only Burberry – now down 17% after dispensing with its chief executive – has done worse today. Ocado uses robots running around grids to try to make supermarket deliveries more efficient and therefore profitable. However, after surging in value during the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, investors have grown wary of its expected cash needs. Reuters reports that Bernstein, a US brokerage, has said the company’s shares will “underperform”, compared to a previous rating of “outperform”. It expects the share price to move towards 260p – a stark cut from its previous target of 1000p. The report suggests that Ocado should “consider its options” to go private in a grocery deal and reduce cash burn. That would be a major blow to the London Stock Exchange, given that Ocado is one of the few prominent UK tech companies. The broker said: Liquidity challenge is real and significant with both existing debt refinancing and a need for more cash soon. The UK government’s stake in NatWest has fallen below 20% for the first time since the bank was bailed out during the financial crisis. NatWest, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, said that the government now owns 19.97% of its shares, after selling off 81m. The government had owned 38% in May, before a programme of share sales. Paul Thwaite, NatWest’s chief executive, said: Returning NatWest Group to full private ownership remains a key ambition and we believe it is in the best interests of both the bank and all our shareholders. Let’s take a closer look at the numbers for Donald Trump’s media company: he could be in line for a paper gain of $2bn thanks to the soaring valuation after the failed assassination attempt over the weekend. Trump Media and Technology Group’s shares started trading at $57.25 on 26 March, when it merged with a special purpose acquisition company (Spac). It soared on its first day to a high of $79.38 – briefly valuing it at more than $10bn. It has not hit those heights since then. Spacs became a sensation during the financial market bubble during the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. A shell company lists on the stock market, raises a load of cash, and then looks for a company to merge with – offering a quicker route to a listing. Trump’s company – whose stock market ticker bears his initials, DJT – jumped on the Spac bandwagon, and benefited from the “meme stock” craze as many political supporters bought in. Yet the financial reality facing the company has been quite tricky, as the Truth Social network has struggled to attract the users to justify its lofty valuation. In April the company’s share price dropped as low as $22.55. It has never recovered to its opening price on 26 March, and by Friday it was at $30.89. In pre-market trading (which happens off the main stock exchange) the value of DJT shares rose by as much as 70%, although that surge has weakened somewhat in recent minutes. Google Finance suggests the share price is up 53% at $47.29. DJT was worth $5.87bn at the close on Friday, and Trump himself owns 60%, according to Refinitiv. If that 53% gain is replicated when US markets open, then the notional value of Trump’s fortune would rise by about $2bn. However, Trump is prevented from cashing out on his fortune until September, under terms that prevent him selling shares. The US presidential election does not take place until November. The reaction to the Trump assassination attempt on traditional financial markets has been fairly muted – especially compared with the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group share price surge. The US dollar is almost flat against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, while US futures prices suggest US benchmark stock indices will gain about 0.5% when they open later. US Treasury bond yields have tended to rise when the prospect of Donald Trump winning back the presidency appears to increase. That is on the assumption that his economic policies would increase inflation and add to government debt. The price of benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds fell in price on Monday. The yield on those bonds (which moves inversely to prices) rose by 0.02 percentage points to 4.206. The share price of Donald Trump’s media company has surged in pre-market trading after the attempted assassination of the US presidential candidate. Demand for shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG), the owner of the X rival Truth Social, appeared to soar on Monday. The share price rose 70% in trading ahead of the opening of New York’s Nasdaq stock exchange. Traders appear to be speculating that the assassination attempt makes a Trump victory in the November presidential election more likely, and that that would benefit TMTG, despite its financial struggles so far. The price of bitcoin has jumped 10% in a move that some analysts have linked to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on Saturday. The price of one bitcoin rose above $63,000 on Monday, and was up 9% over the day, according to Refinitiv. The cryptocurrency – which tends to be more volatile than many traditional assets – had slumped from above $70,000 in early June to below $54,000 in early July. Its record high was in March, when it hit 73,803. The theory is that the Trump’s defiance after the assassination attempt makes him more likely to win, and that he will then be more likely to ease regulations on bitcoin, as he has courted crypto advocates, including in a June meeting with crypto “miners” (owners of computers that make the calculations crucial to the decentralised cryptocurrency’s functioning). Many cryptocurrency advocates have links to libertarian politics. Rania Gule, market analyst at XS.com, an online trading platform, said that bitcoin had gained after Joe Biden’s poor performance in a debate against Trump earlier this month: I believe that US political news is driving gains in cryptocurrencies because it is a “speculation-driven” area. If re-elected, Trump may seek less stringent regulatory policies towards cryptocurrencies, potentially improving regulatory conditions and encouraging more investments. His policies towards international relations and foreign trade also have a significant impact on the market, as tensions or stability in international relations may lead to fluctuations in cryptocurrency markets.

UK revenues for the London-listed company were down 18%, while Asia Pacific revenues were down 15%. Toby Fowlston, chief executive, said: Fee income for the first half of 2024 continued to reflect the rebasing in market conditions relative to the post-pandemic peak. This period of market adjustment is now longer in duration than previously expected, with macroeconomic turbulence and political uncertainty restraining client and candidate confidence in certain geographies. Our near-term planning now assumes that any material improvement in confidence levels will be gradual, and likely not occur before 2025. Burberry’s struggles and the surprisingly weak Chinese economic figures are putting luxury and fashion stocks across Europe under pressure. Watch company Swatch Group also reported a steep fall in sales in the first half of its financial year. JP Morgan analysts said that Swatch has one of the highest exposures to China among its European rivals, according to Reuters. they wrote: We think the sector will likely come under pressure first thing this morning, and notably Richemont, the most obvious read-across. Cartier owner Richemont fell 2.6% and Louis Vuitton owner LVMH was down 1.7%. As might be expected after such a brutal set of news on Monday morning, Burberry’s share price has slumped. The fashion company is down 11% in early trading. It has been a pretty torrid year. You can see today’s slump in the very bottom right of the below chart, but it has been one-way traffic for much of 2024. Shares are down 45% for the year. It looks like those Chinese GDP data may have set the mood for Monday on stock markets, with Europe’s indices falling at the opening bell. London’s FTSE 100 and Spain’s Ibex are both down 0.4% in early trading, so it doesn’t seem to be a reaction to the football at least. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters: EUROPE’S STOXX 600 DOWN 0.3% GERMANY’S DAX DOWN 0.2% BRITAIN’S FTSE 100 DOWN 0.4% FRANCE’S CAC 40 DOWN 0.5%, SPAIN’S IBEX DOWN 0.4% EURO STOXX INDEX DOWN 0.4%; EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS DOWN 0.4% Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. All change at the top of British fashion: Burberry has announced the departure of chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd after it was forced to cancel its dividend after a slump in sales. Akeroyd has left the FTSE 100 company “with immediate effect by mutual agreement with the board”, Burberry said on Monday morning. Burberry has appointed American Joshua Schulman, a former Michael Kors boss, to replace him. Gerry Murphy, Burberry’s chair said the performance was “disappointing”. He said: We moved quickly with our creative transition in a luxury market that is proving more challenging than expected. The weakness we highlighted coming into full year 2025 has deepened and if the current trend persists through our second quarter, we expect to report an operating loss for our first half. In light of current trading, we have decided to suspend dividend payments in respect of full year 2025. The data published by Burberry in its accompanying trading update do not make for pretty reading for shareholders: comparable store sales are down by 21% to £458m in the 13 weeks to 29 June. In the Asia Pacific region sales are down by 23%. Revenues across the entire financial year could drop by 30%. Burberry said: We are operating against a backdrop of slowing luxury demand with all key regions impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty and contributing to the sector slowdown. Chinese GDP grows by 4.7%, below 5.1% forecast Buberry’s struggles have been put into context by Chinese GDP figures earlier this morning: growth slowed to 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter, down from 5.3% in the first quarter and below the 5.1% expected by economists polled by Reuters. China’s Communist party leaders are meeting for their “third plenum” this week, the forum that takes place about every five years at which they set out their long-term policies on the economy. The government is aiming for 5% growth in 2024, which may be a challenging target if the weakness persists. The figures were “hampered mainly by weak consumer spending and demand”, said analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid. They added: Other data showed that China’s retail sales slowed to +2.0% y/y in June (v/s +3.4% expected and the worst since December 2022) after advancing +3.7% in May, thus highlighting that the world’s second largest economy is struggling to boost consumption. Adding to the negative sentiment, China’s home prices fell again in June, declining -0.67% on the month with existing home prices declining -0.85%.

        "title": "UK has almost 1m EV chargers, with new public one installed every 25 minutes",
        "content": "There are now almost 1m electric car chargers in the UK, according to data, a figure that the industry argues is proof that installations are keeping pace with increasing sales of battery vehicles. There were 930,000 UK chargers at the end of June, according to ChargeUK, a lobby group, but the majority of these have been installed in homes and business premises, with only about 65,000 public chargers available. Public chargers range from ultra-rapids at motorway services to slow chargers on lamp-posts. The ChargeUK analysis showed that a new public charger was installed every 25 minutes in the spring quarter as companies raced to keep up with demand. Companies installed 5,100 public chargers during the second quarter of 2024, according to the data company Zapmap. The shift from polluting petrol and diesel vehicles to electric technology is seen as crucial for the world to cut carbon emissions and limit global heating. However, the perception of a slow rollout of charge points has been an important factor holding back some drivers from switching to electric cars. Vicky Read, the chief executive of ChargeUK, said that the analysis suggested some of those concerns may be misplaced. She said: “In little more than a decade, the UK’s charging sector has grown to become a major player in the green economy, providing the infrastructure that more than a million EV drivers rely on today and scaling fast to deliver the charging needed through to 2030 and beyond.” There are 1.1m electric vehicles on UK roads, including 167,000 cars sold in the first half of this year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders lobby group. That is a 9% increase compared with the previous year, although the share of electric sales only increased marginally to 16.6%, as relatively higher upfront prices and rising interest rates deterred some buyers. ChargeUK’s analysis, which was carried out by the thinktank New AutoMotive, suggested that the private sector was confident it could meet a target set by the previous Conservative government of 300,000 public charge points by 2030. Labour promised in its general election manifesto to “accelerate the rollout of charge points”, although it has not detailed how it will do this or whether it will stick to the 300,000 target. However, the charge point industry is concerned that the pace could slow if the government does not take action to speed up connections to the electricity grid and make it easier to receive permits and planning approvals for public chargers. “While the outlook is positive, there is still work to be done,” Read said. “Delivering what the UK needs by 2030 means continuing to grow at pace, ensuring that deployment ramps up in locations that have been hampered by delays, and ensuring the UK has a thriving EV market, so that investment in infrastructure continues at scale.” Shell Recharge, owned by the FTSE 100 oil company, is the leader in providing the most public charging points in the UK, with just under 9,000 public charging points. Pod Point and Connected Kerb are the next largest companies in a competitive market, with about 5,000 apiece.",

        "title": "China’s economic growth slows amid weak retail spending ",
        "content": "Pressure on Beijing to take steps to improve Chinese consumer confidence has intensified after news that weak retail spending dragged down the growth rate of the world’s second biggest economy. With falling house prices still acting as a drag on activity, official figures showed the Chinese economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter – much weaker than the 5.1% expected by the financial markets. Annual retail sales growth slowed from 3.2% to 2% in the three months ending in June – the weakest in 18 months – and fell slightly in June alone. Lynn Song, the chief China economist at ING bank, said retail sales growth was the lowest since the country emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns and showed the depressed state of consumer confidence remained a big headwind to the economic recovery. “A negative wealth effect from falling property and stock prices, as well as low wage growth amid various industries’ cost cutting is dragging consumption and causing a pivot from big-ticket purchases toward a basic ‘eat, drink and play’ theme,” Song said. The government in Beijing has set a growth target for 2024 of 5% – something analysts consider to be a stretch in the absence of tax cuts, spending increases and measures to help the property market. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to June, compared with a downwardly revised 1.5% in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said. To counter soft domestic demand and its property crisis, China has increased infrastructure investment and ploughed funds into hi-tech manufacturing. Strong export growth has partly compensated for the reluctance of consumers to spend. Figures released last week showed China’s exports in June were up 8.6% from a year earlier, while imports shrank by 2.3%. Duncan Wrigley, the chief China+ economist at Pantheon Macro, said: “The property market is showing tentative signs of bottoming out. New home prices sank 0.67% month on month in June, a trivial improvement from the 0.71% drop in May. Preowned home prices dropped 0.85%, after the 1.00% dive in May. Residential sales value fell 12.2% year on year in June, partly thanks to base effects, after crashing 26.4% in May.”",

        "title": "Information commissioner urges water firms to ‘be open’ about sewage spills",
        "content": "Water companies must be transparent with the public about sewage spill data, the UK’s information commissioner has warned. John Edwards has written to the water companies calling on them to be as transparent as possible with their customers, and has asked them to disclose information related to sewage discharges every month. Water companies have recently been uncooperative with data requests, refusing to reveal memos and data about sewage discharges. The companies operate a monopoly, meaning customers cannot switch to another provider if they are unhappy with the service. One of the few powers the public has is to request data about sewage spills under freedom of information laws. The true scale of sewage spills into English rivers was first revealed under data transparency laws. In 2020, the Guardian reported that water companies discharged raw sewage into rivers on more than 200,000 occasions in 2019. The figures were obtained via environmental information requests, and traced releases of sewage from storm drains in rivers across England by all nine water companies. Last year, there was a record amount of human waste dumped in waterways. In 2023, raw sewage was discharged for more than 3.6m hours into rivers and seas, in a 105% increase on the previous 12 months. Edwards said: “My message to water companies is simple – put transparency first. The public has no choice but to use our water companies, therefore these companies should ensure they have every confidence in doing so. The current concerns about sewage pollution have dented this confidence, so we’re calling on these companies to be open about their activities to help rebuild this trust. It’s both their responsibility and their legal obligation.” In May 2024, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) issued six water companies – Anglian Water, Severn Trent Water, South West Water, Northumbrian Water, United Utilities and Yorkshire Water – with decision notices requiring them to disclose the start and stop time of sewage discharges. David Black, the chief executive of the industry body Ofwat, said: “One of the prerequisites for building public trust is a culture of openness. As trust in the water sector is falling, that tells us companies have more to do. They should move to embrace open data as a matter of course, and they should be more open in sharing their plans and progress. And they should not wait to be pushed. Customers have paid companies to install monitors and collect their data. They have a right to see what it says.” Water companies have previously refused to release information about sewage spills when there are investigations ongoing into the leaks. Recently, a tribunal case found that a legal exception, which says releasing information would prejudice an investigation, did not apply to the requested information. Edwards said: “In the past, water companies have argued that disclosing information could prejudice ongoing investigations. It is now clear, following this tribunal ruling, that this defence should not stand in the way of transparency – just because information could be relevant to an ongoing investigation does not necessarily mean that it cannot or should not be released.”",

Households’ hopes for a cut received a setback last week when the Bank’s chief economist, Huw Pill, warned that key measures of inflation remained “uncomfortably high”. Jonathan Haskell, another member of the MPC, said last week that he favoured keeping rates unchanged. The most dovish member of the MPC, Dhingra has been a consistent advocate of cutting interest rates since first casting a vote to reduce official borrowing costs in February. She said inflation had fallen sharply and was on track to moderate further in the coming months. The consumer prices index (CPI) eased to 2% in May, down from 2.3% in April, hitting the Bank’s target. Producer prices – the prices charged by manufacturers, which can reflect future changes in consumer prices – have also fallen in recent months, according to official figures. Dhingra said this was a harbinger for consumer prices. “We still think there is more to come in terms of deflationary forces, including if you look at non-energy services which is what people have been concerned about,” she said. Interest rates were raised at 14 successive meetings of the MPC between December 2021 and August 2023, taking them from 0.1% to their current level – driving up the cost of mortgages and loans for households and businesses.",

        "title": "Burberry replaces chief executive as it issues fresh profit warning",
        "content": "Burberry has warned again on profits and ousted its chief executive, as the struggling British luxury fashion brand announced a change of direction to “reconnect” with core customers. In an unscheduled trading update on Monday, Burberry said Jonathan Akeroyd was leaving the company with immediate effect and “by mutual agreement with the board”. It comes less than three years after the former Versace boss was appointed in 2021. Burberry has parachuted in a former chief executive of the US fashion brand Coach, Joshua Schulman, to the top role to replace Akeroyd and revealed a list of “immediate actions” needed to reverse the company’s fortunes after issuing its second profit warning this year. It follows a double-digit decline in sales across its core markets in what the company described as a “disappointing” first quarter. Store sales in the Americas and Asia Pacific tumbled 23%, while sales in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa dropped 16%. Burberry’s London-listed shares plunged 15% after the gloomy statement on Monday morning, making it the top faller on the FTSE 100. The company also announced it was suspending shareholder dividend payouts. The fashion brand said that under Schulman’s leadership it would focus on “more of the timeless, classic attributes that Burberry is known for”. That will include an outerwear campaign to be launched globally in October, “building on the established resilience of our house icons”. “We believe there is an opportunity to reconnect with our core customer base and capitalise on the enduring appeal of Burberry’s iconic products and brand while delivering relevant newness,” the company said. The brand’s chair, Gerry Murphy, said that would mean shifting focus back on to products that have historically been key to the brand’s growth, including its trench coats and scarves, known for the distinctive Burberry check pattern. Burberry has been suffering amid a slowdown in demand for luxury goods, which also hit the sales of rivals including Kering, which owns brands including Gucci and Balenciaga, and Mulberry earlier this year. However, Burberry’s failure to revive sales has clearly caused concern among board members, including Murphy who called the first-quarter results “disappointing”. “We moved quickly with our creative transition in a luxury market that is proving more challenging than expected,” he said. “If the current trend persists through our Q2, we expect to report an operating loss for our first half.” Murphy added: “We expect the actions we are taking, including cost savings, to start to deliver an improvement in our second half and to strengthen our competitive position and underpin long-term growth.” Bosses confirmed on a press call that those actions would result in “a few hundred” job cuts, primarily in its UK corporate office, and that consultations were already under way. It will also mean working to improve online sales with a website revamp next month. Murphy pushed back against claims that Burberry’s strategy now appeared “incoherent”, arguing: “The strategy has been quite coherent for a while.” “With the benefit of hindsight, in a weak market we perhaps went a bit too far, too fast with the creative transition, at a time when customers are feeling a bit more challenged, [and] a bit more conservative,” he told journalists, explaining that shoppers seemed less willing to try new items that came with high price tags. “We’ve recognised that by saying, look: we’ve got to re-establish the prominence of our core offer … products that are timeless classics familiar to Burberry’s customers.” He said the board had not had any “serious discussions” about replacing the chief executive until very recently, and had already been speaking to Schulman, who is also a former director of the British luxury paint company Farrow &amp; Ball, about taking a potential role on its board. As for its outgoing boss, Murphy said Akeroyd was “popular and very well liked, and respected here by everybody, including the board. But sometimes, things don’t work as planned and you have to change your plans, and that’s what we’ve agreed with Jonathan and that’s really all I want to say about it.”",

        "content": "Lloyds Banking Group will start converting its disused office sites into social housing, as the UK’s largest mortgage provider lays the groundwork for a fresh housebuilding boom after Labour’s election win. The bank, which started reviewing its property portfolio during the Covid lockdown in 2020, is launching the programme with a decommissioned data and office space in Pudsey, West Yorkshire. Lloyds will sell the site to a local housing group with the agreement that 80 new homes will then be rented at about half the usual rate. Lloyds said it was assessing other potential offices and datacentres in the UK that it could do something similar with. Meanwhile, Lloyds announced it was also expanding its Citra Living private rental arm to become the first UK bank in the affordable housing market. Citra, which was launched in 2021 to diversify income from traditional lending, will buy the homes and remain the landlord, while local authorities take on everyday management. The pilot will start in Cambridge next month, with rentals offered to struggling households at 80% of market rates. It is part of a wider package of measures announced by the chief executive, Charlie Nunn, as he prepares to host housing bosses and policymakers for an inaugural social housing forum in London on Monday, where he will continue calls to build 1m social and affordable homes. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has pledged to build 1.5m new homes to address the UK’s housing crisis over the next five years. While Labour has not yet detailed how many of those homes will be offered social or affordable rates, Nunn said he was cautiously hopeful that the party would achieve more than the Tory party was able to during its 14 years in office. “Labour’s commitment to it is clearer than the last government,” Nunn told the Guardian. “We obviously didn’t see, in the last period of time, some of the changes that would be needed to really unlock the level of the ambition that we think is needed for the UK to prosper going forward.” Sceptics will question why a commercial lender would be willing to sacrifice larger profits, especially at a time when interest rates are expected to drop and eat into bank earnings. One reason is that affordable homes are a reliable source of income. With UK households facing a chronic shortage of new homes and near-record house prices, there will be consistent demand for affordable housing. Affordable rents can make it easier for people to save up a deposit to eventually buy a home. That could indirectly benefit Lloyds, which owns the Halifax brand and is the UK’s largest mortgage lender. “When you’re in the affordable space, [which is] the low end of the private rental space, we think that’s a really important pathway to home ownership,” Nunn said. Citra also launched its first rent-to-buy scheme last year. Nunn insisted there were no plans to package up and securitise the projects, which would involve bundling affordable rental contracts and selling off slices to investors on the open market. However, Lloyds may end up seeking co-investors, particularly insurers and pension providers, that are also on the hunt for reliable returns for savers and retirees. That could also involve deploying retirement savings from Lloyds’ Scottish Widows arm. “All pension plans have 30- or 40-year or 50-year payouts that they’re managing. There is that opportunity to put a percentage of that money into a long-term investment, like housing. So that’s not packaging them up or securitising … that’s actually putting them as a bedrock of a stable source of returns for pensioners,” Nunn said. Lloyds is also ring-fencing £200m worth of loans for small housing providers who would otherwise struggle to access funding. Nunn admitted there was a “low return hurdle”, meaning Lloyds is prepared to make less money on the loans than usual, but he insisted that it was “a return that does meet our shareholders expectations”. Nunn is now hoping his social housing forum, scheduled less than two weeks after the general election, gains the attention of the new Labour government. That could open the door to talks with Nunn’s social housing initiative group, which includes bosses from Homes England, Legal &amp; General, the housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Homes, the homelessness charity Crisis, as well as local authorities and housing associations. “I’d like to get a chance to engage on the policy agenda because we now have a group of people who have got really specific ideas,” Nunn said.",

        "title": "Number of agreed UK house sales over past month ‘up 15% on 2023’",
        "content": "The number of agreed house sales over the past month was 15% up on this time last year, according to Rightmove, as buyers anticipate “gamechanging” interest rate cuts they hope could come as early as August. Britain’s biggest property website said homebuyers largely shrugged off the “distractions” of the general election and the Euro 2024 football tournament to keep transactions well above this time last year. It said the average price of property coming to the market for sale dropped a fractional 0.4%, or £1,617, to £373,493, although it warned prices in the south-east fell by 2% alone. However, Rightmove said the number of sales being agreed was now an “encouraging” 15% above the same period a year ago and sales were likely to increase by the autumn. This time last year the UK market was struggling to cope with the peak of mortgage rates. The Rightmove director Tim Bannister said many would-be home movers were waiting for the first Bank of England rate cut, from a current level of 5.25%, before acting. Households’ hopes of a cut in interest rates received mixed messages last week. On Wednesday the chief economist of the Bank of England, Huw Pill, said key measures of inflation remained “uncomfortably high”, somewhat dampening hopes of an early August rate cut. However, a number of big-name lenders appeared to think otherwise, as by the end of last week they had all cut the price of their best mortgage deals. The UK’s biggest lender, Halifax, reduced its rates by up to 0.13%, while Barclays reduced them by up to 0.33%. The bank’s five-year fixed-rate mortgage is now the cheapest on the market at 4.08%. Their moves follow a series of cuts from lenders including NatWest and HSBC over the past few weeks. A rate war appears to be under way, say brokers. Adrian Anderson, the managing director of the brokerage Anderson Harris, said cheaper mortgage rates would have a positive impact on people’s ability and willingness to borrow. He also said he would not be surprised to see some five-year fixed-rate mortgages priced below 4% by the end of the year. Rightmove said that the average five-year fixed rate was now 4.97%, which while substantially below the peak of 6.11% in July 2023, is still much higher than the average of 2.51% that homebuyers were being offered back in July 2021. Rightmove’s Bannister said interest rate cuts could be the gamechanger that would kickstart the market. “A first base rate cut [by the Bank of England] for over four years, together with the new political certainty, could set the scene for a positive autumn market, with improved affordability and a more confident outlook in the second half of the year,” he said.",

        "content": "Nils Pratley’s article on the water industry in England and Wales provided a succinct summary of the sector’s history, and how it was brought down by investor greed and weak regulation (Cheap sales, debt and foreign takeovers: how privatisation changed the water industry, 10 July). The privatisation story, however, has two halves. The first was one of increased investment (after years of inadequate public funding), with improved operational and capital efficiency. Purposeful design headed off asset-stripping, while excessively entrepreneurial activities were constrained. The second half saw regulatory relaxation, weakened environmental enforcement, and infrastructure funds seeking better returns. Investors know that high returns can’t be sustainably delivered by low-risk businesses, but it didn’t stop new owners and lenders stepping in, leading to overborrowing. This is the heart of the issue, and a more proactive regulator might have headed this off – given that “whole company securitisation” was part of the private equity playbook by that time. Fortunately, Thames Water has plenty of funding to cover ongoing operating costs – but it may not be able to service its debt. This must be restructured to an affordable level, and financiers will have to bear the cost of their own greed or incompetence. Thereafter the company will be highly investable. Such a restructuring might best be negotiated without the need for receivership, nationalisation or special administration. Politically savvy financiers might welcome this. Yes, excess dividends may have been taken, but those are now gone – unless the companies acted illegally. However, like the billions lost to Covid misspending, HS2 and other government mistakes, we have to accept them – the difference being that these losses are recovered through highly visible water bills rather than opaquely through our taxes. Bill Kingdom Oxford • As a former regulator – in water, rail and the ill-fated London Underground public-private partnership (PPP) – I understood that the first rule of regulation should be that customers should only pay once. But this still raises the question of the nature of the “regulatory contract”. In the PPP, it was decided (rightly or wrongly) that the infrastructure companies should be paid the efficient cost of delivering outputs, even if these costs were initially underestimated. For most regulated industries, including water, the contract is essentially a fixed-price one, subject to adjustment only for specified items such as changes in legal obligations. Companies can challenge the proposed contract by appealing to the Competition and Markets Authority. If they do not appeal, then they are accepting the contract and have to deliver the regulated outputs, whatever the cost. Failure to deliver in one five-year period does not mean that the previous contract can be renegotiated. Indeed, serious failings should lead to additional penalties. So Feargal Sharkey is right to challenge Ofwat’s draft decisions (Ofwat accused of showing ‘contempt’ to customers over water bill price rises, 11 July) if the regulator has effectively reopened the previous contract. That is an empirical question that careful examination of the draft determinations (and final determinations of the previous review) can answer.

        "title": "Thames Water owner to liquidate solar energy subsidiary amid debt crisis",
        "content": "A solar energy project developer linked to Thames Water is to be liquidated and its staff made redundant as the crisis engulfing the debt-laden water supplier puts strain on its complex corporate structure. Trinzic Operations Ltd, which is ultimately owned by Thames’s parent company Kemble Water Holdings, is to be voluntarily shut down, the Guardian can reveal. Sources said Trinzic, which is based in London, is subject to a members’ voluntary liquidation – when a solvent company is shut down – and Kemble is attempting to recoup more than £25m from the business. A filing with the Insolvency Service shows that 37 employees will be made redundant at the company, which was set up to develop floating solar projects on Thames sites to boost the company’s renewable energy generation. The job losses start at the end of the month. Some employees may be given roles at Thames. It is understood Thames told Trinzic it did not plan to transfer any assets to Trinzic or enter any further commercial arrangements with it after a U-turn by investors on £500m of pledged funding in March. Despite efforts to find further investment, Trinzic will now be wound down. A source close to Thames said that Kemble was “urgently” attempting to recover funds from Trinzic, as consultants at Alvarez &amp; Marsal work with Kemble to assess its options. It is unclear whether, after the cash needed for restructuring is spent, any funds recovered from Trinzic will be distributed to external shareholders. Senior executives at Trinzic are understood to be in line for large payouts – in excess of 12 months’ salary. The majority of staff are expected to leave with redundancy payments worth at least three months’ pay. Thames Water is laden with £15.2bn of debt and said last week that it only has sufficient funding to run its operations until June next year. If it collapses, it is expected to be temporarily nationalised. Regulator Ofwat has put Thames into a form of special measures. The Guardian revealed in April that a development company that sells off land no longer needed by Thames, Kennet Properties, paid out a £14.5m dividend in the year to 31 March 2023 despite the difficulties faced by the wider group. At the time, sources close to Kemble said the Kennet dividend had ultimately reached Trinzic. In Thames’s complex structure, both companies sit outside the ringfenced operating company, which is regulated by Ofwat. The transfer of funds between the group’s web of companies have been under the spotlight as Thames struggles and the legacy of previous owners, who extracted huge dividends over a number of years, is examined. Ofwat is studying two sets of dividends, of £37.5m and £158m, approved in October and March. Trinzic was set up as Thames Water Ventures in 2021 under the stewardship of Tony Vasishta, a former executive at the telecoms company Liberty Global where he ran its real estate arm. The aim was to develop land no longer needed by the household water supplier to build projects generating solar power, storing energy and harnessing heat from the waste network to provide clean energy. The electricity generated would be sold back to Thames – a significant energy user with a £220m energy bill – at an agreed rate, cutting its costs and carbon emissions in the process. However, documents seen by the Guardian from April show that Thames believed Trinzic’s progress is “significantly behind” its original forecast. The venture was supposed to produce nearly 4,000 megawatt hours of electricity by June 2024, but it was on track to produce less than 1,000MWh by that point, the document said. Thames had already scrapped a target to hit net zero by 2030. An initial seven project sites were due to be transferred between 2020 and 2025, funded by the regulated Thames Water Utilities Ltd “with a view to sell to Trinzic upon completion”, documents said. However, they said that a contractor had “raised concerns about TW’s financial position”, causing delays. Delays were expected to sites in Little Marlow, Iver South and Swindon, it said. Sources said that executives at Thames and Trinzic had struggled to find a commercial model which benefited both parties, with Thames concerned it was taking on too much risk as they attempted to agree a 25-year power deal. Kemble declined to comment.",

        "title": "Labour should scrap two-child benefit cap sooner rather than later |  Larry Elliott",
        "content": "The first real test of Labour’s hardline approach to public spending has surfaced within a week of the party taking office – and it is a big one. The issue is child poverty and in particular the two-child benefit limit introduced by the Conservatives in April 2017. This prevents households from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third or any subsequent child born after this date. For good reason, the two-child limit is loathed by many Labour MPs because while having no impact on the number of children families have, it has had the predictable result of increasing poverty. The Resolution Foundation thinktank says the number of families affected by the policy has increased from 70,000 to 450,000 in the past six years and that a third of its impact is yet to come. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) says the two-child limit can cost households up to £3,455 a year – a massive hit to family budgets. Child poverty is at its highest ever level, and Labour says it has “an ambitious strategy” for reducing it. Currently, this ambitious strategy does not extend to scrapping the two-child benefit cap, even though CPAG says doing so would lift 300,000 children out of poverty at a cost of £1.7bn a year. No other single measure the government could take would be as cost-effective in reducing the number of children living below the breadline. Labour’s line is that scrapping the two-child limit is something not currently budgeted for in its programme, so abolition will have to wait until there is money to spare. The argument is that this would open the floodgates to a host of other demands. This might make short-term sense but it is still misguided. The two-child cap will not survive five years of a Labour government with such a commanding parliamentary majority, and so it is a question of when, not if, the policy originally brought in by George Osborne will be canned. Delaying that decision condemns more children to a life of misery and want. There is an economic case for a more generous approach to welfare – poor families tend to spend more of their income than rich families – but there is also a moral dimension. Needlessly pushing more children into hardship is plain wrong. Finally, £1.7bn is a tiny sum in the context of a £2.7tn economy, and there are plenty of ways the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, could find it without any difficulty. As the tax expert Richard Murphy has shown, taxing capital gains at the same rate as income would net the Treasury £12bn a year, while restricting tax relief on pensions to the basic rate of income tax would raise a further £14.5bn. Removing the losses the Bank of England makes on its gilt holdings from the way the government’s debt rule is calculated would raise an estimated £20bn, according to the consultancy Oxford Economics. Labour has been keen to do nothing – and say nothing – that might rattle the financial markets, and a degree of prudence makes sense. There are, though, limits to that approach. Reeves has made much of how Britain is living in an age of insecurity, and you don’t get much more insecure than a family suffering a benefit cut in excess of £3,000 a year. The two-child cap should go without delay.",

        "content": "Some 91% of the 1,290 business owners recently surveyed by the employee scheduling software maker Homebase said that they were happy with their jobs. Who are these happy people? And why are they so darned happy? It’s not the small business story we usually hear. The National Federation of Independent Businesses says small business owners’ optimism has been below average for 29 months and their uncertainty is the highest it’s been since 2020. Small businesses are “struggling” to make rent and “racking up” credit card debt. Many are “facing recession”, some say they “can’t survive” and others say they’re “feeling the pinch” or “stuck in an economic nightmare”. My clients complain to me all the time. They say their employees don’t show up to work. They tell me their suppliers don’t ship supplies on time. They have customers that haggle away their profits, delay their payments or simply don’t pay at all. Their accountants tell them to pay taxes with money that’s already been spent on inventory. They grapple with health insurance, workers’ compensation, logistics, duties, levies, finance fees, commissions and all the other little costs that add up to big expenses. They generally work long hours in dusty, dirty industrial complexes. They hate their competitors and their competitors hate them. And yet with all of these challenges, all of these headaches, all of these concerns, the Homebase survey says that basically all of them are happy? Is this possible? Yes, it is. Those same clients of mine who complain, kvetch and carp? The fact is they wouldn’t have it any other way. Even with all these headaches, most wouldn’t have it any other way. They enjoy running their businesses. They would never go back to being an employee for someone else. Happiness is relative. And they’re relatively happy. Is it because they’re “passionate” or “fulfilled” or “making a difference” or “changing the world”? That’s what those dreaming of starting up a business say … until they quickly realize that it’s a cold, hard world out there. Most of the business owners I know aren’t “entrepreneurs”. They’re not “launching a startup” or “pursuing their dreams”. They’re making sandwiches, fixing car engines, mowing lawns, fixing roofs and pouring cement. They’re driving trucks, cutting paperboard, distributing machinery parts and installing pipes. Many are doing this out of necessity, not out of choice. But that’s OK. They’re still happy. Is it because of money that they’re so happy? Definitely not. Sure, we read about the zillionaires who started out of their parents’ garages. But this only happens to one in a zillion. Most small business owners earn an average of $100,000 per year, far less than what many could make as an executive in corporate America. Plus, they wouldn’t have to worry about their health insurance, retirement and where the next check is coming from. And yet they’re happy. Why? It’s because of control. Like most people running a business, I can deal with all the bullshit, all the headaches and all the stresses. I can deal with the hours, the responsibilities and the risk. I can deal with all of this because the decisions are mine to make. Every problem I have is owned by me. Every decision I make affects my life. My 600-plus clients are my boss, not one person. Running a small business means having more options, more choices and more flexibility with one’s life. You can choose to work 20 hours a day or not. You can choose to work at 2am because you went to your kid’s soccer game that afternoon. My father once told me that employees are no more than two weeks away from unemployment. At least as a business owner, you’ve got a little more time than that. And you have the ability to change direction. The more you can control your fate, the greater your happiness.",

        "content": "Ed Davey hit the headlines for falling off a paddleboard, bungee jumping and Zumba dancing as part of his unconventional election campaign. But the Liberal Democrat leader’s attention-grabbing stunts paid off when his newly resurgent party won 72 seats, its highest total since 1923. Fresh from his triumph, Davey will be in the spotlight for a more sombre reason on Thursday, as he testifies to the public inquiry into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal. Davey, who was postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012, and Pat McFadden, Labour’s new chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, are among politicians who have had responsibility for the Post Office in the past and face questioning this month. The inquiry is examining the Post Office’s policy of hounding and prosecuting branch operators for more than a decade, alleging financial shortfalls in their accounts. It has since emerged that these discrepancies were caused by IT bugs within the Post Office Horizon computer system. All three main political parties face questions over what they knew about the scandal, which gained fresh prominence after a powerful ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, documented the fight for justice waged by Sir Alan Bates. McFadden – who was Labour’s election campaign co-ordinator and is now a powerful figure in Keir Starmer’s government – will give evidence to the inquiry on Thursday. McFadden was minister for postal affairs between 2007 and 2009 under Gordon Brown. He told the BBC earlier this year that he wished he had asked more questions about Horizon. He said: “Each time an MP raised a question about this, the reply would come back from the Post Office that they thought the system was robust, they had no evidence to suggest there was anything wrong with Horizon.” But even in 2009 there were warning signs. Computer Weekly published its first article about convicted Post Office operatives in May that year, and Bates formed his Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance a few months later. Davey became postal affairs minister in the coalition government in 2010. He has faced criticism for having initially refusing a meeting with Bates that year – although the pair did meet later. Writing in the Guardian, Davey said: “I’m sorry I did not see through the Post Office’s lies – and that it took me five months to meet Alan Bates.” Two former Lib Dem leaders who held office in the coalition government will also testify this month, including ex-business secretary Sir Vince Cable. Speaking to TalkTV this year, Cable said “large numbers” of ministers had been in charge during the scandal, which he termed a “terrible failure by the British state and government”. Before leading the Lib Dems for five months in 2019, Jo Swinson was postal affairs minister between 2012 and 2013 and again in 2014 to 2015. She will answer questions on 19 July. She was in the job when forensic investigator Second Sight carried out a review of the Horizon IT system and told parliament in July 2013 that its report had found “no evidence of system-wide problems with the Horizon software.” She has since said she had been misled. The toughest questioning is likely to be reserved for politicians who held office under Conservative governments from 2015, when the scandal was regularly hitting the headlines. In 2015 BBC’s Panorama highlighted concerns with Horizon and by 2016 Bates and 554 other subpostmasters had begun high court action against the Post Office. Baroness Neville-Rolfe, a junior minister between 2014 and 2016, is due to testify on 23 July. The inquiry has already heard that in 2015, Neville-Rolfe asked Tim Parker, who was taking over as chair of the Post Office, to look at the Horizon scandal with “fresh eyes” and examine concerns regarding the IT system. Parker has told the inquiry that he commissioned a barrister-led review, but its 2016 report was not shared with the Post Office board and the government was only briefed orally because of legal concerns. Greg Clark, business secretary between 2016 and 2019, will testify in late July, as will along with former ministers Margot James and Kelly Tolhurst. James told Channel 4 earlier this year that she wished she had done more to help operatives. Clark, James and Tolhurst all held government posts during the landmark 2019 high court case at which the Post Office continued to argue that its Horizon IT system was reliable and post office operators must be to blame for shortfalls. Davey and McFadden have been contacted for comment. • The headline of this article was amended on 14 July 2024. An earlier version referred to “three former Liberal Democrat leaders”. This has been changed to “Ed Davey and former Lib Dem leaders”.",

        "title": "For a government with two-term dreams, Labour is making a lot of short-term plans | Richard Partington",
        "content": "For a chancellor targeting a decade in power, Rachel Reeves is in a hurry. After 14 years in the wilderness for Labour, and several centuries of Britain awaiting its first female chancellor, it’s not surprising she is keen to get on with the job. So far, two ideas have predominated: blaming the Conservatives for the worst economic inheritance since the second world war, and laying the foundations for national renewal at breakneck speed. Reeves says there isn’t any time to waste to get Britain on track for the highest sustained levels of growth in the G7. But it is a task that will involve tough trade-offs and challenges, and will come to define Keir Starmer’s government. In the scramble to look busy, ministers have been hurriedly working behind the scenes to reshape the institutions of Whitehall and get the government machine aimed at Reeves’s primary objective. One quick win was the creation of a new council of economic advisers, housed within the Treasury and led by top London School of Economics academics John Van Reenen and Anna Valero. More changes are due in Wednesday’s king’s speech, including the government’s legislative plans for workers’ rights, planning reform, the NHS and Great British Energy, Ed Miliband’s prized low-carbon power company. Sources say we can expect a big announcement on infrastructure, too. The government is keen to show it is committed to getting mega-projects built after the stop-start failures of the Tory years. There is a rush to finalise plans, including the potential abolition of the National Infrastructure Commission, which would be replaced with a new body. Elsewhere, Starmer is setting up “delivery boards” packed with external experts for his five key “missions” for government: growth, energy, crime, education and health. The challenge, though, is whether the reforms will succeed in getting Britain’s economy back on track. Successive governments have carried out similar tyre changes on the Whitehall motor, only to end up with the wheels spinning on the road to prosperity. This time Labour is preparing to rely heavily on the private sector, in acknowledgment of tight constraints on the public finances. After the Tories’ Brexit-era “fuck business” approach, there is obvious latent potential to unlock. However, the government ought to be realistic about how far this might go. For decades, the UK has trailed comparable rich nations on business investment – a fact made worse by the economic vandalism of austerity, Brexit, and the churn of Conservative prime ministers. Figures from Capital Economics show total investment in the UK has shrunk from 26% of GDP in the late 1980s to 18% today – a bigger decline than the rest of the G7. That suggests Labour is aiming to get from the bottom of the investment league table to the top: the equivalent of Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016, a 5,000-1 dream come true. Bringing about stability will help. The UK now stands as a beacon of relative calm in an increasingly volatile world. There will be further tailwinds as inflation cools, and the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates soon. Reeves’s new national wealth fund could help encourage investment in some certain parts of the economy, as part of a broader modern industrial strategy – details of which are said to be in the pipeline. However, Labour’s manifesto implies cuts to public investment as a share of GDP from the current starting point, putting even more weight on the private sector to lead the charge in Britain’s unlikely Leicester-inspired campaign. Unlocking more private capital could require the government to be bolder with its own investment plans. To do so without deviating from Labour’s tax promises, Reeves could use the review of public spending she commissioned last week to pave the way for changes in the government’s fiscal rules. The chancellor is also said to be keen to revamp the Office for Budget Responsibility, including a request for reports on the long-term impact of capital spending decisions. Currently, the Treasury watchdog publishes five-year forecasts. But this fails to capture the benefits from big infrastructure programmes, which can take longer to materialise. Such a change could help strengthen the case for investment. There is ample evidence that this might be a good idea, including from Van Reenen and Valero, who were among the authors of a report earlier this year calling for a temporary boost to public borrowing to drive investment in sustainable technologies and infrastructure. “[It] would prove cost-effective and beneficial to living standards and economic competitiveness by increasing productivity and economic growth,” they wrote. In the early days of Labour’s putative decade in power, this could have the biggest effect on growth.",

        "title": "‘A beacon of hope’: England’s Euros success gives pubs a vital lift",
        "content": "Culture lovers flocked to the Hockley Social Club this year to marvel at the Birmingham Royal Ballet performing highlights from Tchaikovsky’s Sleeping Beauty. On Sunday, it will be the balletic grace of local lad Jude Bellingham that awakens the spirits of 1,000 football fans gathering to watch England battle Spain in the Euro 2024 final. The success of the Three Lions heralds a badly needed money-spinner for the venue, one that is particularly poignant because it came courtesy of a last-minute winner from another Birmingham hero, Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins. “We were booked up within minutes of the final whistle going,” says Jack Brabant, a Villa fan and director of the social club and its sister venue, Digbeth Dining Club. “It was a flood, we were just watching the ticker going up and we had to close off bookings completely.” The British Beer &amp; Pubs Association (BBPA) has estimated that Gareth Southgate’s men reaching the final means British bar staff will pull 10m extra pints, worth £48m. The broader hospitality sector stands to enjoy a boost of between £700m and £800m across the whole of the tournament, according to the trade body UK Hospitality. The upper end of the estimate is dependent on good weather and an England victory that would see fans take full advantage of government-approved late licensing, until 1am. That is why the final is “more than just a match; it is a beacon of hope”, according to the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, Michael Kill. The hospitality sector has had a rough time over the past four years, starting with the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced pubs, bars and clubs to shut their doors for weeks at a time. Successive blows have choked off the sector’s recovery, with more than 500 pubs closing for good in 2023. Now, Euro 2024 offers the biggest tournament takings boost since the 2018 World Cup. Covid restrictions were still in place for Euro 2020 [held in 2021] while Qatar 2022 was staged in winter, cannibalising pre-Christmas sales, and matches mostly kicked off during the day. “I can’t emphasis how important this is,” says Duncan Sambrook, managing director of Sambrook’s Brewery, which will be screening the final on five giants screens at its taproom in London’s Wandsworth. “It’s all been doom and gloom in our industry, one crisis after another. Staffing crisis, followed by energy crisis, followed by the cost of living crisis.” England’s success has come just when the sector needs it most, particularly given the poor summer weather so far. Sambrook’s takings on Wednesday, during the semi-final, were four times what they would normally be. Sunday’s surge could be even bigger on what would normally be a relatively quiet night. The taproom has arranged its seating to create a “stadium feel” and staff – in more than twice their normal numbers – will be wearing specially made shirts with their names on the back, emulating the sporting stars on the screen. Extra brewing began weeks ago, to ensure that the taps wouldn’t run dry if England – or in theory Scotland – made it to the latter stages. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, says the average sales uplift across the sector had been 30% on match days in the group stages but has since accelerated to 40%. She is hoping the sporting party will last beyond the tournament. “People are marketing it as a summer of sport. Yes you’ve got the Euros but on the back of that people are coming in to watch the cricket and lots of pubs are advertising the Olympics.” The sport-loving crowd has diversified too, with the triumphs of England’s women’s team broadening the customer base. The audience for the Lionesses, says Nicholls, brought in more extra revenue than the Six Nations rugby tournament. At Hockley Social Club, some of the ballet connoisseurs might even put in an appearance on Sunday. “The great thing about when teams do well is that it brings out the occasional fans, but they don’t necessarily want to be part of that beer-throwing laddish behaviour,” says Brabant. The venue has even married culture with football, with musicians from Birmingham Symphony Orchestra playing pieces including Nessun Dorma, the soundtrack to England’s agonising semi-final defeat at Italia 90. Like the title of Puccini’s aria, the hospitality sector is hoping that, come Sunday, nobody will be sleeping.",

        "title": "‘As prepared as we can be’: UK airlines and airports get ready for summer getaway",
        "content": "It’s time. The summer holidays are upon us and that sunshine jaunt booked back in January is suddenly imminent. But as the first travel chaos stories of the season start to pepper the headlines – a power cut here, a baggage meltdown there – clouds of anxiety can gather over daydreams of beach bliss. In the post-pandemic rush to head overseas, the air and travel industry uncovered ever more new things to go wrong. In 2022 came the realisation that there were simply not enough staff for the flights sold to take cooped-up Brits briefly off the island. Then last summer culminated in an unprecedented air traffic meltdown affecting tens of thousands of passengers. But the appetite for travel continues unabated: Stansted and Manchester airports had record numbers in June, while Heathrow saw its busiest ever day on 30 June. As ever more flights crowd into the airspace, and airlines sweat their assets with swift turnarounds and relentless activity, the potential for knock-on cancellations and delays is vast. As the lottery people like to say, “it could be you”, and indeed, it could: it’s more likely you will be stranded in a foreign airport or mysteriously sans baggage than win a pile of cash. Gratifyingly, the odds are still small. So how is 2024 shaping up – and what can airlines, or the nervous traveller, do to further minimise the risks? Extreme weather has been arguably the biggest headache for the travel industry so far, disrupting flights and threatening to blight summers one way or another, through foreign heatwave hell, staycation high water or an alarmingly early start to the hurricane season. That may have contributed to the rise in late bookings reported by the holiday firm Jet2, as people assess the alternatives. The extreme heat that affected much of southern Europe did not appear to deter bookings last year, according to easyJet. Even late summer wildfires in Rhodes and the warnings for tourists amid Greece’s 40C June heat are still pitted against the unusually wet and cold British summer. While holidaymakers may find something tolerable in between, the weather has been increasing disruption to flights. Between the peaks and troughs, summer storms are a growing issue with almost 48% more delays in Europe attributed to adverse weather in 2023 than in 2022, according to the Brussels air traffic organisation Eurocontrol. British Airways was among those making cancellations two weekends ago, with rerouting due to storms in which two of their planes were struck by lightning. Wet weather on returns home also has an impact: air traffic controllers increase the gaps between planes to ensure safe landings, limiting the number that can fly back in. Air traffic control more broadly has become a vexed issue for airlines, with strikes abroad and more recent troubles from staff shortages at Gatwick’s tower. Most ill-timed and inexplicable was a gremlin in the UK’s air traffic control system that halted flights for hours last August bank holiday: due either to a “black swan event”, according to those responsible at Nats (national air traffic services), or “engineers sitting at home in their jimmy-jams”, according to Ryanair’s furious boss, Michael O’Leary. Either way, Nats has worked to ensure that combination of events should never recur, while Gatwick said Nats had “successfully increased the number of controllers and assured us there will be the required resources to deliver this year’s busy summer schedules”. Staff shortages in multiple areas of aviation was the overwhelming story of 2022’s troubled summer, as airports and airlines struggled to recruit enough security line workers and baggage handlers in particular. Manchester airport was the scene of some of the worst queues, and there was trouble at Heathrow and elsewhere with passengers also held in long security and check-in delays. EasyJet and BA were among those forced to cancel thousands of flights in advance to try to pre-empt disruption. Extensive recruitment has filled those gaps. A Heathrow spokesperson said: “We’re fully staffed and as prepared as we can be.” And airport bosses stress that many of those raw recruits are now fully trained with a year’s experience behind them: Manchester airport last month saw 97% of passengers through security in less than 15 minutes, despite a power cut that meant a day of delay and cancellations. The last two years have also seen a rise in aviation strikes – with everyone from firefighters to refuellers seeking to follow overworked frontline staff in boosting low pay during the cost of living crisis. Recent disputes involving some workers at Gatwick, and Aer Lingus pilots, have for now been resolved. The impact for travellers has frequently been lower than threatened – even Border Force strikes last year delayed few people. But passengers can be cheered by the news that some of the most unpredictable and disruptive strikes, the dreaded wildcat actions by French air traffic controllers, have been rendered unlikely this summer due to a generous pre-Paris Olympics settlement. The Olympics have also ensured that the EU has delayed its entry-exit system until at least October – now a headache for another summer, particularly on the ground for the Port of Dover and Eurostar, both making extensive preparations. Dover nonetheless has warned travellers to expect “exceptionally busy” summer weekends this year due to the Olympics increasing traffic by up to 30%, leading to a two-hour processing time for ferries. Back at the airports, hopes are high for a smoother year. Aviation insiders maintain that a number of lurid headlines are overblown. Referring to a recent story depicting alleged chaos, one exasperated executive said: “That’s a picture of an orderly queue. That’s what an airport looks like.” And the stories can be self-fulfilling: during the staffing troubles of 2022, many holidaymakers took to arriving even earlier, filling terminals long before check-ins opened. As a source at a major carrier put it: “We’ve had a few difficult weekends. When things happens at the last minute it’s not predictable … There are lots of different challenging external factors. We’re always going to have things beyond our control.” To try to mitigate disruption, easyJet and BA have made large investments in their control centres at Luton and Heathrow to provide quicker and swifter responses to events. More automation and AI is being used to assess the availability of crew and planes to swiftly resolve the complex permutations of who and what can be reallocated, where, as need arises. Even if a new source of travel chaos is surely waiting in the wings, the industry is confident it is in a better place. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, said: “The summer season has got off to a positive start and, notwithstanding recent adverse weather and air traffic control challenges across Europe, airlines are looking forward to another busy summer taking millions of customers away on their holidays.” Another airline director urged: “Just make sure they buy travel insurance.”",

        "content": "Hackers stole call and text message records on “nearly all” of AT&amp;T’s customers, the communications giant disclosed on Friday. The immense data breach took records of tens of millions of people’s phone use from around a six-month period in 2022, along with a single day in January 2023. According to AT&amp;T, a suspect has been apprehended. AT&amp;T, which revealed the hack in a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, stated that the data includes records of which numbers customers texted or called over a certain period of time, as well as the number of times the calls took place. The data doesn’t include other kinds of personal information associated with the numbers or information on what was said during the interactions. “The data does not contain the content of calls or texts, personal information such as social security numbers, dates of birth, or other personally identifiable information,” AT&amp;T said in the filing. The company stated in its annual report last year that it had over 127m devices connected on its network, but did not state in the SEC filing exactly how many of these were part of the data breach. The Federal Communications Commission announced on Friday that it had opened an investigation into the hack, while AT&amp;T stated that it was taking action to prevent future attacks. “AT&amp;T has taken additional cybersecurity measures in response to this incident including closing off the point of unlawful access,” the company said in its filing. “AT&amp;T will provide notice to its current and former impacted customers.” Although the stolen data did not include the names associated with the phone numbers, that information would probably be easy to reverse-engineer using online data brokers and public records. The hack also affected non-AT&amp;T customers of mobile virtual network operators who were using the company’s wireless network. The company learned about the hack on 19 April, according to the filing, and is working with law enforcement efforts to find the perpetrators. It follows another hack of AT&amp;T’s data that it disclosed in March, which did contain the personal information, including social security numbers, of millions of users. Cyber-attacks have continued to target major companies across industries throughout this year, with hackers sometimes holding data ransom or releasing it online. Ticketmaster is still reeling from a hack in May that affected about 560 million customers, and has resulted in hackers leaking ticketing information online while demanding millions of dollars in ransom payments.",

        "content": "The pound has risen by 0.5%, hitting a daily high of $1.2981, boosted by strong economic growth data and the perceived stability offered by UK assets following Labour’s decisive election victory last week. Sterling is close to a one-year high of $1.2995, touched on 27 July 2023, and approaching the $1.30 level, where it last traded in April 2022. Britain risks a tech “talent drain” to the US if British pension funds fail to back the sector, according to the co-founder of a UK chipmaker that has announced its sale to Japan’s SoftBank. Nigel Toon, the co-founder and chief executive of Graphcore, said domestic pension funds were giving inadequate support to private businesses in the UK. “They’re certainly not investing in private companies here in the UK,” he said. “How can we expect businesses to grow without those pools of capital unless they secure funding from other sources?” As well as British pension fund investors missing out on the benefits, said Toon, there was a risk that UK tech talent is lured away by foreign investors that have stepped in to provide growth funding. US-based venture capital firms could, for instance, require British startups to move across the Atlantic, the Graphcore boss said. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. Have a fab weekend. We’ll be back on Monday. Take care – JK The UK justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has just announced the release of 1,000 prisoners in an attempt to ease the pressures faced by overcrowded prisons. James Timpson, now minister of state for prisons since resigning from his chief executive post at Timpson Group earlier this week, has long pushed for reform of prisons. He has made headlines for his radical approach to business including hiring ex-convicts, writes Jonathan Yeboah. The company was founded in 1865 by William Timpson and has since operated as a family business spanning through five generations. It has long specialised in shoe repairs, and has also expanded into key cutting, watch and phone repairs. A key Timpson principle has been giving people a second opportunity in life, and it started hiring former prisoners in 2002. Of its 5,600 staff, 10% are ex-offenders. It does not require its applicants to apply with a CV, rather, they look for “fun, interesting, snappy” people, James has said. Timpson’s net profit grew by 56% between 2021 and 2023, despite a fall in sales in the midst of the Covid pandemic. Last year, it made profits of £38.3m. The group owns seven subsidiaries which vary from photo printing to dry cleaning to locksmith services. Branch managers and their teams at Timpson are actively encouraged to offer discounts and even free services to customers. Remarkably, 4% of Timpson’s transactions are done at no charge. “Giving things away is the most profitable thing we do. Customers always remember kindness,” the company asserts. James Timpson, also the author of the book, The Happiness Index, urges businesses and business leaders to put people at the heart of business. Carpetright, one of the UK’s biggest flooring retailers, is seeking additional investment to stave off possible collapse after filing a notice of intention to appoint an administrator. The company confirmed it had filed the notice of intention with the high court to appoint administrators whilst it works to finalise additional investment to secure the long term future of the company. The move, first reported by the Times, effectively gives the company 10 days protection from creditors whilst sales negotiations continue and Carpetright tries to secure a future for its 272 stores which employ 1,852 people in the UK. Carpetright will continue to trade during this process. PwC has been lined up as possible administrators but has not been appointed. High court records show that Carpetright, advised by law firm Travers Smith, filed the notice on Friday. The firm has been struggling in recent months due to the economic downturn which has seen consumers have cut back on spending on furnishings and furniture due to the economic downturn and rising cost of living. In addition Carpetright suffered a cyberattack which disrupted trade in April and subsequently impacted its plans to restructure. Kevin Barrett, chief executive of parent firm Nestware Holdings, said: We remain focussed on securing external investment to ensure as few customers and colleagues are impacted as possible. They are our main priority and we are taking all appropriate action to make sure they are informed and supported through this process. We have begun promising conversations with interested parties that are moving in the right direction, encouraging us that Carpetright has a viable future. Germany’s flagship carrier Lufthansa has slashed its 2024 profit guidance for the second time and warned on profits for the second quarter, sending its shares lower. Along with other airlines, the company is struggling with high labour and operating costs coupled with weaker revenues per passenger because of pressure on ticket prices. The share price fell nearly 4% and later traded 2.4% lower, pulling down British Airways owner IAG by 2.8% and Air France-KLM by 2.1%. Lufthansa said its adjusted earnings before interest and tax fell to €686m in the three months to June, from €1.1bn a year earlier. It reports full second-quarter results on 31 July. It now expects a full-year profit of between €1.4bn and €1.8bn, down from its previous estimate of €2.2bn. It is launching a turnaround programme affecting Lufthansa and its regional carrier Cityline. A market-related decline in yields in all traffic regions – especially in Asia – had a negative impact. Lufthansa Airlines is particularly affected by the challenges posed by the negative market trend and by inefficiencies in the flight operations of Lufthansa and Cityline, also due to delayed aircraft delivery. It is becoming increasingly challenging for Lufthansa Airlines to break even for the full year. To counteract this, a comprehensive turnaround program is being launched. Airbus has launched a new cost-cutting drive including a hiring freeze in its planemaking business, following recent cuts in production targets. Code-named “LEAD!” the new initiative will tackle an increase in unit costs, and address productivity issues, Reuters reported, citing an internal memo to staff. The shares are up 0.85% today. Citigroup beat Wall Street expectations with quarterly profits, lifted by a 60% jump in investment banking revenue and gains in its services division, sending its shares up 3% before the bell. The third-largest US lender reported a profit of $3.2bn in the three months to 30 June, up from $2.9bn a year earlier. Revenues rose by 4% to $20.1bn, helped by a $400m gain from the partial sale of Visa stock in May. Investment banking fees hit $853m amid a resurgence in corporate deals. Chief executive Jane Fraser said: Our results show the progress we are making in executing our strategy and the benefit of our diversified business model. The results come two days after US regulators fined Citi $136m for making “insufficient progress” in fixing data management problems discovered in 2020. Citi had already booked the penalties and additional investments related to this in the second quarter. Fraser is carrying out a sweeping overhaul of the bank’s sprawling businesses in a bid to improve its performance and cut costs. Producer prices in the United States rose moderately in June, causing US stock market futures to turn negative briefly as this dampened hopes of interest rate cuts. The producer price index rose by 0.2% in June from the month before, after being unchanged in May, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Statistics said. The annual rate picked up to 2.6% from 2.4%. Wall Street futures dipped slightly on the news, but are now up again, pointing to a broadly flat open in just over half an hour. Yesterday, a surprise 0.1% dip in consumer prices in June from May, which took the annual rate to 3% from 3.3%, boosted expectations of a September rate cut. Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, told lawmakers during testimony this week that the inflation environment was improving. Holding interest rates too high for too long would threaten economic growth and jobs, he told Congress on Tuesday. The US is “no longer an overheated economy”, Powell said, adding that its job market has “cooled considerably” from its surge after the early damage inflicted by the pandemic. The Post Office chief executive, Nick Read, said he would temporarily step back from the role so that he can give his “entire attention” to the next stage of the Horizon inquiry. Read wrote in a note to staff that he and the board agreed he should step back over the summer to prepare for the next phase of the inquiry, which will look at current practices at the Post Office, and begins in September. Deputy chief executive Owen Woodley will take charge of day-to-day activities for the next seven weeks until the end of August, Read said. The note, sent yesterday, said: It is vitally important that we demonstrate the changes we have made and give confidence to the inquiry and the country at large that ‘nothing like this could happen again’. Following a discussion with Nigel [Railton, incoming chair] and the board, we have agreed that I should give my entire attention to the task of preparing the business for Phase 7. More than 700 subpostmasters were wrongly prosecuted by the Post Office and handed criminal convictions between 1999 and 2015 because the Japanese firm Fujitsu’s faulty Horizon IT system made it look as though money was missing at their branches. Read succeeded former boss Paula Vennells, who this year forfeited her CBE following public anger over her handling of the Horizon crisis. She testified to the inquiry over three days in May, in a sometimes tearful set of evidence sessions about her conduct. In February, the business and trade committee of MPs expressed a lack of confidence in Read’s leadership, accusing him of giving misleading evidence. He has also denied a claim made by former chair of the Post Office Henry Staunton that he had threatened to resign unless he got paid more. He was “exonerated of all misconduct allegations” following a report into his behaviour earlier this year. The external report, which the Post Office has not released, was said by Staunton to contain allegations about Read’s “conduct and lack of his management of the many governance and compliance issues”. The Post Office said at the time that the review cleared him of any misconduct claims, and that he had the full backing of the board to continue to lead the business. Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, said: JP Morgan’s results showed us two things: First, investment banking and equities trading did really well compared to last year. Secondly, we see Main Street banking beginning to sputter. Provisions for credit losses were up significantly, showing us that JP Morgan is expecting to see a rough patch in the US economy. Also, there was a big increase in interest expense, which grew far more quickly than interest income. Nevertheless, JP Morgan has navigated a challenging interest rate environment very well. A number of big US banks have kicked off the earnings season. JPMorgan Chase posted a 25% rise in second-quarter profit, lifted by rising investment banking fees and an accounting gain of $8bn from a share exchange deal. The largest US bank made a profit of $18.15bn in the three months to 30 June, compared with $14.5bn a year earlier. It benefited from a plan to exchange some of its shares in Visa, the world’s biggest payment network. Wall Street banks have benefited from an increase in companies raising capital in the debt and equity markets, and an uptick in fee income from advising on M&amp;A deals. However, chief executive Jamie Dimon cautioned: While market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks. These tail risks are the same ones that we have mentioned before. The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II — though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown. Next, there has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world. Therefore, inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects. And finally, we still do not know the full effects of quantitative tightening on this scale. The bank’s shares dipped by 0.6% in trading before the opening bell. Wells Fargo fared less well, reporting lower quarterly profits because of higher deposit costs amid intense competition for customers’ money, sending its shares down by more than 5% in pre-market trading. The bank’s net income fell to $4.91bn between April and June, from $4.94bn a year earlier. Net interest income, the difference between what a bank earns on loans and pays out for deposits, slid by 9% to $11.9bn, which was worse than expected. Average deposit costs jumped to 1.84% from 0.71%. Here’s our full story on the China trade figures: China posted a record $99bn (£76.4bn) trade surplus last month amid signs of importers bringing forward orders to beat higher tariffs on goods from the world’s second biggest economy. The latest official figures from Beijing showed exports growing at their fastest rate in 15 months, while the weakness of China’s domestic economy resulted in falling imports. The size of China’s trade surplus was far bigger than the $85bn expected by the financial markets and comes at a time of heightened concern in developed countries about Chinese exports. Higher US tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles and other hi-tech products come into force on 1 August, while higher EU import duties on Chinese electric vehicles came into force earlier this month. Unilever intends to cut as many as 3,200 jobs – a third of all office roles in Europe – by the end of next year as part of a major global restructure announced in March. The FTSE 100 company, which makes well-known consumer products such as Marmite and Dove soap, has come under pressure from shareholders including activist investor Nelson Peltz. It told senior executives about the planned cuts on Wednesday, according to details of a company-wide call shared with the Financial Times. The job cuts are part of Unilever’s “productivity programme” announced in March that includes up to 7,500 job losses globally. The company employs between 10,000 and 11,000 office-based staff in Europe. Constantina Tribou, a chief human resources officer, said during the video call, according to the FT: The expected net impact in roles in Europe between now and the end of 2025 is in the range of 3,000 to 3,200 roles. In March, the company also announced that it would spin off its ice-cream division as part of an overhaul aimed at saving about €800m (£672m) over the next three years. At the time, Hein Schumacher, who was appointed as chief executive in January 2023, and took over from Alan Jope last spring, said there would be some job cuts at Unilever’s head office in London, and some at business units in other countries. The pound has risen by 0.4% against the dollar today, hitting a high of $1.2962 and closing in on the $1.30 level. Sterling last traded at $1.30 more than two years ago. Investors are attracted to the UK currency following Labour’s landslide victory a week ago, amid political instability in France, where Sunday’s elections resulted in a hung parliament. The pound has also been lifted by strong UK GDP data yesterday combined with a surprise monthly fall in US consumer prices and a lower-than-expected annual inflation rate of 3%. This led to investors pilling on bets of a September interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve, and dragged the dollar down against major currencies. Oil prices are rising, with Brent crude up by 0.55% to $85.88 a barrel, on expectations that Fed rate cuts would stimulate demand for crude in the United States, the world’s biggest oil consumer. European shares have extended their rally, on the back of growing expectations that the Fed will start cutting interest rates soon. The FTSE 100 index in London is 25 points, or 0.3%, ahead at 8,249 while the German Dax has gained 0.37%, the French CAC has climbed 0.66% and Italy’s FTSE MiB rose 0.56%. Preparations for Sunday’s Euro 2024 final are reaching fever pitch with retailers, pubs and airlines scrambling to meet England fans’ demand for everything from beer and burgers to replica shirts and flights. Since England’s 2-1 win against the Netherlands on Wednesday, supporters with deep pockets have been scouring the web for flights to Berlin or nearby cities and trying to secure a ticket for the final, the latter said to be changing hands for £2,500. At home, with the weather gods promising some overdue sunshine, high street retailers including Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer expect food and drink sales to rocket between now and Sunday as hosts stock up for barbecues and viewing parties. Fans who prefer a pub atmosphere have rushed to book seats at venues showing the game. In the moments after Ollie Watkins scored the winner on Wednesday evening, the number of reservations processed by the bookings website DesignMyNight soared to 16 a second, compared with the normal rate of 1.4. Don’t call it work from home any more, just call it work. According to new data, what once seemed like a pandemic necessity has become the new norm for many Americans. Every year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases the results of its American time use survey, which asks Americans how much time they spend doing various activities, from work to leisure. The most recent survey results, released at the end of June, show that the same percentage of employed people who did at least some remote work in 2023 is the same percentage as those who did remote work in 2022. In other words, it’s the first stabilization in the data since before the pandemic, when only a small percentage of workers did remote work, and a sign that remote work is here to stay. Here is our full story on the M25 closure between junctions 10 and 11 from 9pm tonight until 6am on Monday: Major supermarkets and business owners across the country are giving staff members a lie-in on Monday to recover from the drama of watching England play Spain in the final of the Euros. The game starts at 8pm and could last until 11pm if it goes to penalties. In preparation, some companies are offering workers early finishes if they are due to be on shift on the evening of the game, while others are telling employees they can come in late on Monday. The supermarket chain Lidl, a sponsor of the tournament, said it would open all its stores in England an hour later on Monday so workers could enjoy some post-match celebrations. Ryan McDonnell, the chief executive of Lidl in Great Britain, said: We know how much this game means to England fans and we want to ensure that our colleagues have the chance to celebrate such a significant moment in English football history. Housing has been in the news a lot this week. Labour will miss its target of delivering 1.5m new homes this parliament without an emergency cash injection into the affordable housing sector, providers have warned. Housing associations and councils have written to deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, saying her promise to deliver “the biggest boost to affordable housing in a generation” will be impossible unless there are urgent interventions to fix the financial pressures providers face. The warning comes as new figures, shared exclusively with the Guardian, show that housing associations, the biggest developers of social housing, started just 32,705 homes in 2023-24. This is down 30% on the 2022-23 figures. The letter – signed by the National Housing Federation, which represents 600 housing associations, and the Local Government Association – said that capped income, crippling cuts and soaring costs had decimated providers’ budgets, reducing the amount of homes they could build. Here is our full story on SoftBank’s acquisition of Graphcore: Graphcore, a British chipmaker once seen as a potential competitor to Nvidia, has been bought by Japan’s SoftBank in a deal that secures the company’s future. The Bristol-based startup’s products are focused on artificial intelligence and it has been acquired by the powerful Japanese tech investor for an undisclosed sum. Last year, Graphcore warned that there was a “material uncertainty” over its survival and that it needed fresh funding by May 2024. Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, alluded to Graphcore’s problems as he backed the deal, saying it was a “welcome end to the uncertainty that has faced Graphcore and its employees”. Graphcore is the latest UK tech company to be bought by SoftBank, which acquired the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm for £24bn in 2016. The warning is to “wait for the snap, crackle and pop” as three glowing electrodes are dropped into an electric arc furnace in Cardiff. What follows sounds like thunder and lightning. It is a human-induced storm in a massive, ceramic-lined cup, holding 140 tonnes of rapidly melting steel. The plant, owned by Spain’s Celsa, melts scrap steel using high-voltage electrical currents that generate the 1,600C needed to turn the metal to liquid. The glowing steel is then ready to be cast, twisted and crushed into the rods used to reinforce concrete. The plant’s million tonnes of annual output have been used in projects ranging from buildings such as the Wembley Stadium and Shard, to infrastructure projects including the Elizabeth tube line and Hinkley Point nuclear power station. The electric arc furnace is a sign of the future for the rest of the UK industry. Tata Steel, based in Port Talbot, and British Steel, at Scunthorpe, are each planning to switch from polluting blast furnaces to the much greener electric technology. The plans will cut emissions, but also involve thousands of jobs losses, including 2,800 in south Wales. Pushing for investment The new Labour government has promised to renegotiate a £500m subsidy, agreed under the Conservatives, for Indian-owned Tata Steel to make the switch and so cut out nearly 2% of the UK’s carbon emissions. Tata tapped the last iron from one blast furnace hours after voters gave Labour a landslide victory at the general election this month, and plans to close its second furnace in September. However, the UK’s newly installed business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has offered more money in the hope of saving jobs. Labour has pledged another £2.5bn investment in the UK steel industry. A large chunk is expected to go to Tata Steel on top of the £500m already agreed. Labour has summoned the bosses of some of the worst-performing train operators, including Avanti West Coast and TransPennine, for meetings next week as it seeks to rapidly reform the railways and reset industrial relations. The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, will bring in Network Rail route directors to attend all talks with the train companies, signalling the move towards an integrated railway. After Haigh vowed to “move fast and fix things”, legislation to kickstart Great British Railways is expected to be announced in the king’s speech next week, and officials are beginning work to set up the new structure before the summer parliamentary recess. Haigh has already met rail union leaders at the Department for Transport as the new government looks to facilitate an end to the long-running rail dispute. Haigh said her meetings with Mick Whelan and Mick Lynch, the general secretaries of Aslef and the RMT respectively, were a departure from “the days of antagonism and gimmicks” and the start of “an era of grownup industrial relations”. US stock market futures have edged higher, pointing to an open near record levels on Wall Street later. Before the opening bell, we will get second-quarter results from big US banks -- JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Bank of New York Mellon are all reporting. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, said: European markets are enjoying a strong end to the week, feeding off a weaker US inflation reading than many had anticipated. While the surprise decline for both core and headline CPI initially helped lift all markets, we soon saw a rotation from big tech to more cyclical stocks. While some will fear the repercussions of a slump in big tech valuations, investors will be encouraged at the prospect of a more broad-based bullish environment for equity markets. Interest rate cuts from the likes of the ECB and the Bank of Canada may have occurred ahead of any Fed reserve easing, but the willingness to further widen that interest rate differential will be questionable given the potential outflows in capital towards the US. With that in mind the recent declines for US core PCE and CPI inflation has helped lift expectations for a September rate cut which in turn bolsters claims of similar action from the other major central banks. Turning to the Chinese trade data, he said: Overnight trade data released from China highlighted continued concerns for their major trade partners, with imports slumping by 2.3% over the year to June. This represents a four-month low for Chinese imports, raising concerns over those businesses and economies relying on Chinese consumption. The notable disparity between exports (8.6%) and imports (-2.3%) does highlight the relative weakness of the Chinese consumer compared to global demand trends. This should come into light once again next week with the latest GDP, retail sales and industrial production data being reported on Monday. On the US banks, he said: There are considerable concerns coming into this second quarter earnings season, with FactSet expecting a 10% decline in year-on-year earnings growth for banking stocks in Q2. With traders having grown accustomed to a widening disparity between the strengthening big banks and stuttering regional banks, traders will be hoping that these Wall Street giants can continue to outperform despite predictions of a more difficult environment. The pound continues to rise, edging closer to the $1.30 level. It was last at that level in April 2022. Sterling is trading 0.3% higher against the dollar at $1.2946, and is up by 0.1% against the euro at €1.1890 – the highest level since August 2022. It has gained about 3% against the euro so far this year, amid political instability in France. The UK currency has been lifted by stronger-than-expected GDP figures yesterday and investors’ perception of stability and confidence in UK assets, following last week’s decisive Labour election victory. At the same time, the dollar weakened, after a surprise fall in US consumer prices last month, which prompted traders to increase bets on a September interest rate cut. The pound is the only developed market currency that has gained against the dollar this year. It has also been boosted by hawkish comments from the Bank of England’s chief economist this week. Huw Pill said recent economic data pointed towards some “upside risks to my assessment of inflation persistence,” suggesting that he is not yet convinced by the case for an August interest rate cut. The first red post box to bear the cypher of King Charles was unveiled today. The new box has been installed on the high street in Great Cambourne in central England. Local school children got to post the first letters, to the king about their interest in the environment. The mail pillar box bears the king’s cypher, the monogram that appears on government buildings which consists of the initials ‘C’ and ‘R’ for Charles and Rex, the Latin word for king, alongside a depiction of the crown. The first post box was introduced in the 1850s, and there are abut 115,000 in operation today. Their age can be discovered by the royal cypher they bear. The oldest dates back to the reign of Queen Victoria, Charles’ great-great-great grandmother. French politics remain in the spotlight in an otherwise light data week for the eurozone economy. Last Sunday’s elections in France resulted a hung parliament. A strong performance by Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) came as a surprise. This hastily assembled alliance of left-wing parties unexpectedly won with 188 seats, though it fell far short of an overall majority of 289 seats. President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist coalition, Ensemble (ENS), also beat expectations winning 161 seats, well ahead of the sub-100 seats suggested by some polls, and Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National (RN) came third with 142 seats – far from the absolute majority that looked possible after strong results in the first round. Ricardo Amaro, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said: France’s election resulted in a hung parliament as we expected, though the strong performance from the left-wing alliance came as a surprise. A minority left wing government is now a possibility, but their more radical proposals would likely be blocked in parliament. We see two other alternatives. President Emmanuel Macron’s group could try to form a grand coalition of moderate left and right parties. Otherwise, Macron could try to appoint a technocratic caretaker prime minister. Neither of these scenarios are easy nor look to be politically sustainable. Moreover, all three are likely to result in policy paralysis, leaving the prospects for France’s government very uncertain. Uncertainty is also a feature of EU politics. Next European parliament’s vote on retaining Ursula von der Leyen at the helm of the European Commission is on a knife-edge. If she loses the vote, a new candidate will need to be found, though no credible alternatives have emerged so far. The EU council is likely to confirm next week that France is to be put into the so-called excessive deficit procedure, along with Italy and five other EU countries. This will oblige the new French government to come up with a credible medium-term adjustment path by September that would slash the fiscal deficit below 3% from 5.4% in 2023. But a divided Assembly will find it hard to agree on politically difficult spending cuts, meaning France is more likely to pose an early challenge to the new EU fiscal rules than to noticeably improve its fiscal outlook. Drivers are being warned to expect delays as a planned M25 closure starts tonight. This is the third of five weekend closures of the M25, which encircles London. as part of a £317m project to improve Junction 10. The AA said many major roads in the south east will be “incredibly busy,” as National Highways shuts the motorway between Junctions 10 and 11 in Surrey from 9pm on Friday to 6am on Monday. Drivers will be directed along a diversion route on A-roads. Many of those travelling to and from the UK’s two busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, will be affected. The closure could also disrupt many journeys to Dover by England football supporters embarking on cross-Channel trips before driving to Berlin for Sunday’s Euro 2024 final. AA patrol of the year Chris Wood said: With many football fans changing their plans following England’s victory over Holland, it’s likely to be incredibly busy in and around London. We advise drivers to plan their journey accordingly, avoiding the west side of the M25 if possible, and to check ferry and tunnel operators’ websites for updates before setting off. There were fears of severe congestion on diversion routes ahead of the first two planned M25 closures in March and May, but many drivers followed advice to avoid the area. National Highways senior project manager Jonathan Wade said: The previous two closures have gone well, with significant progress being made during both. We would urge all drivers to follow the official diversion route as this is the best chance of reaching your destination in good time. Please ignore your satnavs and follow our diversion route instead. National Highways is concerned that satnavs could direct some drivers on to minor roads after leaving the M25, creating gridlock in residential areas. Shutting the motorway this weekend will enable the construction of a new bridge near Junction 10. The project, due to be completed in summer 2025, will increase the number of lanes at the junction, which is one of the country’s busiest and most dangerous motorway junctions. The final two weekend closures as part of the project will take place later this year. Between 4,000 and 6,000 vehicles normally use the M25 between Junctions 9 and 11 in each direction every hour from 10am until 9pm at weekends. European shares are rising again, with the FTSE 100 index hitting a one-week high, as investors were cheered by a surprise fall in US inflation, boosting bets of an interest rate cut in September. The FTE 100 climbed 32 points, or 0.4%, to 8,255 this morning. The German Dax rose 0.25%, the French CAC edged nearly 0.2% higher and Italy’s FTSE MiB climbed by 0.5%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose as much as 0.3% to 521.41, the highest level since mid-June, led by gains in the telecoms sector. China’s exports grew at their fastest rate in 15 months in June, boosted by sales of cars, household electronics and semiconductors, while imports unexpectedly declined amid weak domestic demand. This suggests manufacturers are rushing through orders ahead of tariffs expected from a growing number of trade partners including the EU. There have been calls for further stimulus measures from the government as the $18.6 trillion economy struggles to get back on its fee. Exports grew by 8.6% year-on-year in June to $307.8bn and over the first half of 2024, China’s exports totalled $1.7tn, up by 3.6% year-on-year. Auto exports rose by 18.9% in terms of value in the first half, and by 25.3% in volumes, amid lower export prices. Household electronics sales climbed by 14.8% in value terms, but showed even faster volume growth of 24.9%. Semiconductor exports grew by 21.6% year-on-year in terms of value, and by 9.5% in terms of volume. Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said: While the growth level does not appear too high at first glance, this has been stronger than most market participants were expecting at the start of the year… There still could be some frontloading effect before auto tariffs from the EU and US come into play, but tariffs could lead to a slowdown in auto exports towards the end of the year… Strong semiconductor export growth shows that China’s self-sufficiency push in tech and its pivot towards hi-tech manufacturing is starting to pay some dividends. China has been a major player in both the export and import of semiconductors as it gears up for the AI race. Exports to Vietnam, Malaysia and other Asian countries were strong, and to Latin America, especially Brazil. In contrast, shipments to key developed markets were lacklustre, with exports to the US (1.5%), EU (-2.6%), Japan (-6.3%) and Korea (-3.7%) all a drag on export growth. On the import side, with sluggish domestic demand there were with sharp declines in soybean (-19.8%), vegetable oil (-34.1%), and grain (-16.4%) imports. The continued drag from the property market pulled down down steel (-7.0%) and timber (-5.1%) imports. As China’s domestic car industry produces more competitive products, its auto imports have also contracted sharply, falling by 13.9%, Song noted. The net impact of June’s data of higher exports and slower imports translated to a higher trade surplus of $99.1bn. China’s trade surplus in the first half of the year was $434.9bn, up from $400.7bn a year earlier. Song said: Heading towards the second half of the year, incoming tariffs and moderating growth in other global economies could start to weigh on export growth, but a supportive base effect will likely keep year-on-year export levels in mid-high single digit growth for most months. We expect a smaller boost to growth from net exports in the second half of the year, though if imports continue to disappoint this contribution to GDP growth may remain solid in the coming quarters. Oil prices are rising today after signs of easing inflationary pressures in the United States, the world’s biggest oil consumer, although Brent crude, the global benchmark, is on track for a weekly decline. Brent crude futures rose by 51 cents, or 0.6%, to $85.91 a barrel. US West Texas intermediate crude futures climbed by 59 cents, or 0.7%, to $83.21 a barrel. Both contracts also gained in the past two days, but Brent is poised for a drop of around 1% this week following four weekly gains. US crude stocks have declined. The US Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday that inventories fell by 3.4m barrels to 445.1m barrels last week, which was more than analysts had expected. Yesterday, a bigger-than-expected drop in US inflation to 3% in June boosted expectations of interest rate cuts, which would help boost fuel consumption. Yeap Jung Rong, market strategist at IG, told Reuters: Cooling US inflation numbers may support the case for the Fed to kickstart its policy easing process earlier rather than later, but it also adds to the series of downside surprises in US economic data, which points to a clear weakening of the US economy. Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at the investment firm Capital.com, said: The British pound has maintained its bullish bias since the UK election build-up. The fact that the election seemed so easy and straightforward has given investors a vote of confidence in UK assets, especially at a time when there is quite a bit of political instability worldwide. That’s not to say that the new Labour government will not face challenges up ahead, but for now, the political landscape seems a lot calmer than France. Sterling-dollar has also been taking advantage of a weaker US dollar. The pair has been building the gains day after day. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The pound is hovering near a one-year high following yesterday’s stronger-than-expected GDP data, which showed the UK economy returned to growth in May with a 0.4% expansion. At the same time, US inflation came in lower than expected, falling to an annual rate of 3% in June from 3.3% in May, fuelling hopes of a September interest rate cut and driving the dollar lower. Sterling hit a peak of $1.2947 yesterday, the highest level since late July 2023, and is approaching the $1.30 mark. This morning, it is up by a smidgen to $1.2911. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: In the UK, the pound was already bid yesterday morning after stronger-than-expected growth data helped traders scale back the expectation of an August cut from 70% to a coin toss. Combined with rising hawkish voices at the Bank of England, waning political risks and softening US dollar, we could see cable make an attempt on the $1.30 level. But the fact that the BoE hawks cry louder doesn’t mean that the doves are not around… Japan’s SoftBank has bought the British artificial intelligence chipmaker Graphcore for an undisclosed sum, ending long-running speculation over the company’s future. Once touted as a rival to US chipmaker Nvidia, which has seen its own valuation rocket thanks to booming demand for AI computer chips, Graphcore has struggled to secure the investment needed to compete. Graphcore was valued at $2.77bn at the end of 2020, but the company’s losses widened and it said last October that it needed more cash. It slashed its workforce by a fifth to 494 staff, and shut down operations in Norway, Japan, and South Korea.

        "content": "Britain risks a tech “talent drain” to the US if British pension funds fail to back the sector, according to the co-founder of a UK chipmaker that has announced its sale to Japan’s SoftBank. Nigel Toon, the co-founder and chief executive of Graphcore, said domestic pension funds were giving inadequate support to private businesses in the UK. “They’re certainly not investing in private companies here in the UK,” he said. “How can we expect businesses to grow without those pools of capital unless they secure funding from other sources?” As well as British pension fund investors missing out on the benefits, said Toon, there was a risk that UK tech talent is lured away by foreign investors that have stepped in to provide growth funding. US-based venture capital firms could, for instance, require British startups to move across the Atlantic, the Graphcore boss said. “You naturally get this drain away of good talent from the UK if you’re not careful,” Toon said. “If there isn’t those pools of capital, if they don’t exist here, then the risk is that some of those young companies will be pulled away.” The Bristol-based startup’s products are focused on artificial intelligence, and Toon acknowledged Britain was “doing well” in AI but that was mainly driven by foreign investment from big US tech firms such as Microsoft, Meta and Google, which bought the UK-based DeepMind in 2014. Toon said the SoftBank deal would lead to a multibillion-pound investment in the UK. “This is probably going to end up bringing billions in investment in AI to the UK,” he said, adding that Graphcore would grow its 350-member workforce and build a “very substantial AI engineering effort”. Last year, Graphcore warned that there was a “material uncertainty” over its survival and that it needed fresh funding by May 2024. Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, alluded to Graphcore’s problems as he backed the deal, saying it was a “welcome end to the uncertainty that has faced Graphcore and its employees”. Graphcore is the latest UK tech company to be bought by SoftBank, which acquired the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm for £24bn in 2016. SoftBank remains the biggest shareholder in Arm after its listing in New York last year. It also recently led a $1bn (£774m) investment in the British self-driving technology startup Wayve. Toon said the demand for computing power to train and operate AI systems was vast and was continuing to grow. Graphcore makes chips called intelligence processing units, which can be used to train and operate AI models. Chips are a core piece of hardware behind AI models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, and demand for them has driven the valuation of Nvidia, the market leader, which makes a different type of chip called a GPU, to more than $3tn. “The opportunity here is not to replace Nvidia, which I think is a sort of poor analogy. It’s bringing choice for people and bringing different approaches that allow new types of AI to be developed,” he said, adding that the AI chip market could develop into “two or three” big players including Nvidia. “Can we be one of those other players sitting alongside Nvidia? Absolutely,” Toon said. SoftBank said products such as Graphcore’s would be vital as the tech industry pushed for artificial general intelligence – systems with human-level capabilities. “Next-generation semiconductors and compute systems are essential in the AGI journey. We’re pleased to collaborate with Graphcore in this mission,” said Vikas J Parekh, a managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. The Financial Times, citing two people familiar with the matter, put the value of the deal at $600m. Valued at $2.8bn at the end of 2020, a filing published last year revealed Graphcore needed more cash to break even, after cutting its headcount by a fifth and shutting operations in Norway, Japan and South Korea. Graphcore will continue to be based in Bristol, with offices in Cambridge, London, Gdańsk in Poland and Hsinchu in Taiwan.",

        "content": "For millions of UK employees the shift towards remote working triggered by the coronavirus lockdowns merely meant a better work-life balance, but for Emma*, an office administrator from the Midlands whose husband has a disability and relies on her for care, it was “a lifeline”. Even after Covid restrictions lifted in 2021 she continued to mostly work from home, until she was told last autumn “out of the blue” that she had to attend the office more, though she says no problems had been reported with her output and only “vague reasons” were given. “I said I couldn’t do it as care costs £35 an hour here, it was just unaffordable. They weren’t going to budge, so I had to resign.” Emma has since filed a legal claim for constructive dismissal and will be taking her case to an employment tribunal. She is among dozens of people – some employed by big British brands, others by smaller companies or in the public sector – who shared with the Guardian their difficulties with an employer’s push to reduce remote working. Respondents to an online callout said they had lodged internal grievances after they were asked to work from the office going forward, either full-time or part-time, with some saying they were taking legal action against their employer or considering doing so. Others said they had opted for voluntary redundancy over the issue, had quit their roles or were looking to leave soon, as some of their colleagues had already done. Some employees felt they had been treated unfairly and potentially illegally by their employers when they were asked to return to the office at short notice after lengthy periods of hybrid or remote working. Some said they were awaiting their employer’s decision on a flexible working request and would pursue an employment tribunal if it was not granted because they believed there were no reasonable grounds for a refusal. Such legal action over back-to-desk edicts is on the rise as increasing numbers of companies advocate a minimum number of days attending company premises or a five-day return. The chief executive of Boots, Seb James, who in March ordered staff back in for the full week, is one of many bosses who has suggested that remote workers miss out on the benefits of in-person interaction. A judge at an employment tribunal case brought earlier this year agreed that there were “weaknesses with remote working”, ruling against the request of a senior manager at the UK Financial Conduct Authority to work at home full-time. However, the vast majority of those who got in touch opposed blanket return-to-office directives, suggesting that they were arbitrary, or more about “having bums on seats” in costly office facilities. Many felt that arguments that working on-site was better for productivity were undermined by the fact that their open-plan offices or workplaces were loud and stressful or had a limited number of desks that had to be booked in advance. Jennie, an NHS administration worker from the north of England, said she quit her job this summer after she was threatened with disciplinary action if she did not start commuting hundreds of kilometres to the office with immediate effect, after years of working remotely from a different city. She has taken legal advice on pursuing an employment tribunal because she believes not enough notice was given. “I’m very determined to take this to court,” she said. “I loved my job. I want compensation, and my solicitor has told me I’ve got a case.” Staff at the Office for National Statistics are refusing to comply with an instruction to spend two days a week in offices and voted in April to go on strike over the issue, a case that was referenced by some who got in touch. Kate, a 28-year-old from the south of England, was one of several respondents who said they had been hired for fully remote positions during or even before the pandemic and were furious about having been asked unexpectedly or abruptly to come into to the office. Reasons for wanting to work remotely at least some of the time included caring responsibilities, school runs, health problems or expensive and time-consuming commutes. Like others, she said she had been hired during the pandemic and been “promised opportunities to progress”. However, her employer began making all promotions subject to a reapplication for an office-based position, which she said disproportionately affected female employees. Laura, a corporate accountant from southern England, said she was one of several colleagues who had made flexible working requests this year after her employer, a large hospitality brand, had ordered all employees to be in the office at least four days a week. Remote working had meant that she could put in longer hours while being at home with her primary school-age children, as well as offering more flexibility connecting with overseas colleagues in different time zones. The company initially refused her request to have the option to work from home at least three days a week but after she appealed, she was given two days working from home. “There is no business reason which would negatively impact my employer [if I work from home]. They don’t look at us as individuals with personal needs and different roles.” Her employer’s primary argument for a return to the office, she said, had been “fairness”, because some staff were in roles that made it impossible to work from home. If her request had been refused, she added, she would have taken legal action. Howard, a management consultant in his 50s from London, disagreed with many other respondents’ views on remote working, arguing that it had led to considerable problems in the day-to-day operations at his workplace. It had hit younger staff, he said, who were struggling to learn on the job while isolated at home. “It takes much longer to find out information, or who to talk to,” he said. “Everyone wants to take their time and be at home, but I can see constantly that the things that need to be talked about are only talked about in an emergency.” A number of people with disabilities or health problems, as well as some single parents, said their need to work flexibly or remotely had been disregarded by “draconian” and “inflexible” company-wide orders, and that they were now merely granted short-term exceptions that were subject to frequent reviews. Charlie, an expert in workplace needs assessments who often advises clients who have a disability or are neurodivergent, agreed that it has been getting harder for such workers to get their employer to sign off on suitable arrangements. Widespread negative assumptions about home working, he said, had led many employers to issue sweeping back-to-the-office orders that were not in their own or their staff’s best interests, and potentially in breach of the Equality Act. “I think modern management is largely about conformity and compliance, but the people I work with have specific needs, many of which have legal protections. Employers are at risk of exposing themselves to quite serious legal issues, but it’s also bad for business. Productivity in this country has been flat for a long time, and this inflexibility is one of the reasons behind it.” The high cost of living was the most common reason given for opposing a full-time or near full-time return to the office. Working from home, respondents said, had allowed them to ditch cars, reduce childcare costs, save thousands on train commutes, petrol and parking costs, or even move to cheaper areas. Those trying to recruit staff to both the private and public sector said it had become much harder because their employers refused to allow remote working, which was turning off many applicants who were unwilling or unable to relocate to more expensive areas closer to the workplace. Janet, a head of post-production in the TV industry, said her employer has a strict “no remote working policy” these days. “I’ve lost out on some great candidates as they don’t want to pay London rental prices, nor the expensive travel costs, when the technology is there to support remote working,” she said. “One of the upsides of the pandemic was that it really levelled out the world of work. Everyone worked remotely and it worked brilliantly. So many young people have left the industry now, because they couldn’t afford to come to work. It makes me really angry.” *All names have been changed for anonymity",

        "title": "Thames Water hit with £39m of penalties after missing regulatory targets",
        "content": "Thames Water was hit with penalties of nearly £39m last year after missing a string of environmental targets and said its tumultuous corporate governance had damaged its reputation. The debt-laden company – which was this week put into special measures by the regulator, Ofwat – missed 21 regulatory targets last financial year in multiple areas, from pollution incidents to leakage and supply interruptions, a report said. Thames, which serves 16 million customers across London and the Thames valley, was hit with a £12m penalty after coming bottom among 17 companies ranked for customer service. It said halting brand campaigns to focus on its turnaround had hit its scores, and “customer perception has also been influenced by negative media publicity this year, including the resignation of our CEO, company debt, operational issues, and pollution fines”. The penalties emerged in the company’s annual performance report, which was belatedly released late on Wednesday night. The document was published a day after Thames Water warned that it would run out of cash by next June without fresh funds, and the night before Ofwat put it into the unprecedented “turnaround oversight regime”. Britain’s biggest water supplier could be put into a government-handled administration and the bulk of its £15.2bn debt mountain added to the public purse if it cannot raise extra funds to invest in its ageing assets. Although the new penalties will put further strain on the company’s balance sheet, they are unlikely to play a significant part in deciding its future, as it aims to raise £3.25bn in fresh equity. Ofwat was accused of treating customers with “contempt” as it said bill payers in England and Wales would have to pay an extra £94 on average over five years as water companies attempt to fix sewage spills and leaks which have angered politicians and campaigners. The regulator penalises and rewards English and Welsh water companies based on their performance against multiple targets over a year. Thames’s largest penalty was £16.3m for water supply interruptions, caused in part by an outage in Guildford – blamed on Storm Ciarán – which left thousands in Surrey without water last year. “The weather has once again exposed the fragility of our assets,” Thames said in its report. The company was hit with a £14m penalty for missing leakage targets, blamed in part on cold snaps in December and January; £12m for increasing pollution incidents; and £7m for poor performance in internal sewer flooding. Overall, the £38.6m in total net penalties was down on £82.3m the year before, but above the £35m in 2021-22. Thames received financial rewards for progress in renewable energy production and reducing sewer collapses. Thames Water’s chief executive, Chris Weston, who joined the business in January, said its employees “remain focused on the delivery of our three-year turnaround plan”. The company hopes to avoid nationalisation by raising money in the private markets. In its report, the chair, Sir Adrian Montague, said: “With the right team, time, money and resources, Chris and I both believe we can turn this business around – it would be in the best interest of customers and the environment for Thames Water to remain market-led.” The new penalties come against the backdrop of a strained relationship between Ofwat and Thames. The regulator revealed on Thursday that members of the company’s board did not support elements of its own five-year business plan and called the costs “poorly justified”. Thames Water also said it had to halt a £70m “green economic recovery” (GER) programme, agreed during the pandemic. The programme was designed to accelerate the rollout of smart meters, and the allowance was contingent on the company hitting leakage targets. However, it blamed a drought and “freeze-thaw events” for missing the targets. Ofwat rejected a request to alter the targets. Thames said that decision meant “we were left with no alternative but to stop the GER programme”, and acknowledged that it would be a “disappointment” for customers. The Guardian revealed last year that Thames had failed to install a single smart meter in the Thames valley under the programme, which was supposed to deliver 204,700 of the devices.",

        "title": "China posts record trade surplus as foreign importers rush to beat tariffs",
        "content": "China posted a record $99bn (£76.4bn) trade surplus last month amid signs of importers bringing forward orders to beat higher tariffs on goods from the world’s second biggest economy. The latest official figures from Beijing showed exports growing at their fastest rate in 15 months, while the weakness of China’s domestic economy resulted in falling imports. The size of China’s trade surplus was far bigger than the $85bn expected by the financial markets and comes at a time of heightened concern in developed countries about Chinese exports. Higher US tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles and other hi-tech products come into force on 1 August, while higher EU import duties on Chinese electric vehicles came into force earlier this month. Analysts said the disparity between booming exports and sluggish imports highlighted the reliance of China’s economy on access to the west’s affluent consumers and would put pressure on Beijing to do more to stimulate domestic demand. “This reflects the economic condition in China, with weak domestic demand and strong production capacity relying on exports,” said Zhiwei Zhang, the chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. “The sustainability of strong exports is a major risk for China’s economy in the second half of the year. The economy in the US is weakening. Trade conflicts are getting worse.” Exports grew by 8.6% year on year in June to $308bn (£238bn) and over the first half of 2024 China’s exports totalled $1.7tn, up by 3.6% year on year. Auto exports rose by 18.9% in terms of value in the first half of 2024 and by 25.3% in volume amid lower export prices. Lynn Song, the chief China economist at ING Bank, said there was likely to be a front-loading effect before auto tariffs from the EU and US came into effect, “but tariffs could lead to a slowdown in auto exports towards the end of the year”. Household electronics sales climbed by 14.8% in value terms but showed even faster volume growth of 24.9%. Semiconductor exports grew by 21.6% year on year in terms of value, and by 9.5% in terms of volume. “Strong semiconductor export growth shows that China’s self-sufficiency push in tech and its pivot towards hi-tech manufacturing is starting to pay some dividends,” Song said. Kelvin Lam, a China economist at Pantheon Macro, said there had been a pickup in Chinese exports to the US, the UK and Germany last month. “Export growth of hi-tech products, mechanical and electrical items, cars, and ships is outperforming those low value-added products that China thrived on in the 1990s.”",

        "title": "Labour summons bosses of worst-performing train operators to meetings",
        "content": "Labour has summoned the bosses of some of the worst-performing train operators, including Avanti West Coast and TransPennine, for meetings next week as it seeks to rapidly reform the railways and reset industrial relations. The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, will bring in Network Rail route directors to attend all talks with the train companies, signalling the move towards an integrated railway. After Haigh vowed to “move fast and fix things”, legislation to kickstart Great British Railways is expected to be announced in the king’s speech next week, and officials are beginning work to set up the new structure before the summer parliamentary recess. Haigh has already met rail union leaders at the Department for Transport as the new government looks to facilitate an end to the long-running rail dispute. Haigh said her meetings with Mick Whelan and Mick Lynch, the general secretaries of Aslef and the RMT respectively, were a departure from “the days of antagonism and gimmicks” and the start of “an era of grownup industrial relations”. Avanti and TransPennine Express are the first of a number of failing operators expected to meet the transport secretary in the coming week, with Labour warning it will be making a clear break with the previous government, which it claimed “failed passengers”. It is understood that the party is seeking legal advice over when performance constitutes a contractual breach sufficient to swiftly terminate contracts. The government will otherwise bring train services into public ownership under GBR as contracts expire. Haigh has long criticised Avanti in particular, accusing it during the election campaign of providing a “woeful service” – and this week several newly elected MPs immediately experienced cancellations and disruptions on their journeys on the intercity line from the north to parliament in London. Figures from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, show Avanti had the third worst reliability of all operators in Great Britain in the 12 months to the end of March, cancelling almost 7% of trains. It was twice given short-term extensions to its contract under the Conservatives with warnings to improve, before being awarded a long-term contract in late 2023. Improved industrial relations and an end to the wider rail dispute may help Avanti, which has partly suffered from drivers unwilling to work overtime and occasional high rates of staff absence. Aslef has said “anything is possible” in terms of a resolution to its long standoff over pay and conditions. Whelan said the previous government was an “obstructive puppet master” above the train companies and hoped Labour would allow them to deal freely, without imposing preconditions.",

        "title": "Steelmakers fire up to swap centuries-old reliance on coal for electric arc furnaces",
        "content": "The warning is to “wait for the snap, crackle and pop” as three glowing electrodes are dropped into an electric arc furnace in Cardiff. What follows sounds like thunder and lightning. It is a human-induced storm in a massive, ceramic-lined cup, holding 140 tonnes of rapidly melting steel. The plant, owned by Spain’s Celsa, melts scrap steel using high-voltage electrical currents that generate the 1,600C needed to turn the metal to liquid. The glowing steel is then ready to be cast, twisted and crushed into the rods used to reinforce concrete. The plant’s million tonnes of annual output have been used in projects ranging from buildings such as the Wembley Stadium and Shard, to infrastructure projects including the Elizabeth tube line and Hinkley Point nuclear power station. The electric arc furnace is a sign of the future for the rest of the UK industry. Tata Steel, based in Port Talbot, and British Steel, at Scunthorpe, are each planning to switch from polluting blast furnaces to the much greener electric technology. The plans will cut emissions, but also involve thousands of jobs losses, including 2,800 in south Wales. Pushing for investment The new Labour government has promised to renegotiate a £500m subsidy, agreed under the Conservatives, for Indian-owned Tata Steel to make the switch and so cut out nearly 2% of the UK’s carbon emissions. Tata tapped the last iron from one blast furnace hours after voters gave Labour a landslide victory at the general election this month, and plans to close its second furnace in September. However, the UK’s newly installed business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has offered more money in the hope of saving jobs. Labour has pledged another £2.5bn investment in the UK steel industry. A large chunk is expected to go to Tata Steel on top of the £500m already agreed. Yet there have long been questions over how that cash will be spent, with Tata Steel insistent that it will not turn back from its decision to close the blast furnace. The picture is gradually becoming clearer, as Labour and the steelworker unions converge on a plan that aims to secure new investments which they hope will preserve hundreds of steel jobs in south Wales. The government is unlikely to offer to subsidise the polluting blast furnaces, which are losing £1m a day, according to Tata. But it is understood that fresh investments could include a new plate mill at Port Talbot to make shafts for wind turbines, and a new facility making the valuable galvanised steels used in cars and construction. An industry source said those functions could together provide 500 jobs. Gareth Stace, the chief executive of UK Steel, a lobby group, said he believed there was a “significant future opportunity within offshore wind for the steel sector in the UK” that would be ripe for investment. “We want to be able to supply that steel,” he said. “In order to achieve that we do need investment.” It is understood that the government and unions are unlikely to push for Tata Steel to invest in using hydrogen to produce lower-carbon steel. So-called “direct reduced iron” (DRI) has long been mooted as an option to decarbonise the UK steel industry, but an industry source said DRI appeared to be a non-starter. Three people with knowledge of the talks said there was a weak business case for Tata to build a DRI plant, because it would source most of its raw materials from scrap metal. Another big issue is the complete absence of industrial scale “green” hydrogen made with renewable electricity in the UK. Reynolds this week also raised questions about “the size of the new furnaces that might be put in place” at Port Talbot. Tata is committed to building an electric arc furnace capable of producing 3.2m tonnes of metal a year, and wants to order the machinery by September. Unions are understood to be pushing for discussions on building a second, smaller, electric arc furnace, potentially in Llanwern. However, a source close to Tata suggested the company did not see enough demand to support this. Talks halted on 22 May after another union, Unite, threatened industrial action. However, they restarted after that threat was lifted. Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of Community, another union representing steelworkers, said Reynolds was briefed on a draft memorandum of understanding drawn up between Tata and the unions that discussed possible options. Rickhuss said the business secretary had “acknowledged the investment commitments already secured, and indicated these would form the basis of ongoing negotiations with Tata Steel”. But time was running short, he said. “We call on Tata to engage urgently in meaningful discussions with the government to unlock greater investment and protect jobs.” A Tata Steel spokesperson pointed to previous comments, including by the company’s global chief executive, Thachat Viswanath Narendran, that it was open to further investments but would need a convincing business case to proceed. From coal to electricity Whatever happens it appears that British blast furnaces are on their way out (although Chinese-owned British Steel has yet to make a formal decision on when to close its two furnaces in Scunthorpe). Blast furnaces evolved over the course of hundreds of years of steelmaking, but the basic method is similar to the one pioneered in Britain during the Industrial Revolution. The furnace uses coal combustion to strip oxygen out of iron ore. The resulting molten iron is then processed to produce steel. However, much of the oxygen combines with the carbon in coal to produce carbon dioxide, the biggest contributor to global heating. Electric arc furnaces do not require coal. Tata’s plan is to switch from transforming iron ore into metal, and instead take scrap steel from demolished bridges, buildings, cars – anything usable – and melt it down again using electricity. The circular process promises huge carbon savings compared with blast furnaces. Celsa, which employs 1,800 people in the UK, took over the Cardiff site, formerly known as Allied Steel and Wire, in 2002. It installed the electric arc furnace in 2006. The flames shooting to the ceiling of the Cardiff arc furnace are a clear sign that the process is not carbon-free. However, Celsa said emissions associated with its steel were 88% less than those from a blast furnace. It has committed to be carbon neutral by 2050 and says it will achieve that by using fully renewable electricity, though will have to rely on carbon offsets until it can use hydrogen and other technologies for functions beyond the arc furnace. Sovereign security The shift to electric arc furnaces does not address another issue highlighted by Labour and by some in the defence industry: if the blast furnaces at Port Talbot and Scunthorpe are closed, the UK will be left without a way of transforming iron ore into steel. Chris McDonald, a former Tata Steel engineer, is one of the advocates for Britain investing in a hydrogen DRI facility for the “sovereign security” of being able to make steel. In 2014 McDonald went from Tata’s old research division to the not-for-profit Materials Processing Institute, before being elected last week as Labour’s MP for Stockton North, where he will try to influence the new government. The UK steel sector would probably only need one DRI plant, given the volume of scrap it has, said McDonald. However, it is unclear which individual company would step up to invest. McDonald suggested a plant could be built as a joint venture backed by government. If the blast furnace closures proceed, the UK will be left as the only G20 country without the ability to make its own steel, just as the chaos of global supply chains has come to the fore with the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “I think the onus is on us to explain why we know better than the other 19,” said McDonald. “We want to be able to be sure we can make steel whatever happens in the world.”",

        "content": "Major supermarkets and business owners across the country are giving staff members a lie-in on Monday to recover from the drama of watching England play Spain in the final of the Euros. The game starts at 8pm and could last until 11pm if it goes to penalties. In preparation, some companies are offering workers early finishes if they are due to be on shift on the evening of the game, while others are telling employees they can come in late on Monday. The supermarket chain Lidl, a sponsor of the tournament, said it would open all its stores in England an hour later on Monday so workers could enjoy some post-match celebrations. Ryan McDonnell, the chief executive of Lidl in Great Britain, said: “We know how much this game means to England fans and we want to ensure that our colleagues have the chance to celebrate such a significant moment in English football history.” Tesco said it would close its more than 1,800 Express stores at 7.30pm instead of the usual 10 or 11pm on Sunday to allow employees to watch the final. It promised to allow thousands of staff to get home or to the pub in time for kick-off while still receiving their normal pay for those hours. Sainsbury’s is also closing convenience stores and petrol filling stations across England early. It’s not just retailers planning a late start: the drinks brand Dash Water said employees could start work at a later time of 10.30am on Monday so they could enjoy the game without having to worry about waking up early. The marketing agency FlamePR is closing its office in London on Monday and allowing staff to work from home. If England win, they will also be allowed to start later. The creative PR agency PrettyGreen is offering all staff a free large pizza delivery at any point over the weekend and a lie-in until 11am on Monday. Woodlands primary school in Hertfordshire posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that it knew that “a number of children will be watching the match and going to bed late” on Sunday and it would leave registrations open until the later time of 9.25am on Monday. The comedian John Bishop told fans who had booked to see his show in Wolverhampton on Sunday that the start time would be moved. “I am not doing the show at 8pm,” he said in a video posted to X. “The show will get moved to the afternoon … Anyone who cannot make it will get a refund.” Cary Cooper, a professor of organisational psychology and health at Manchester Business School, said: “People may celebrate if England wins and stay up later, so it is better to be flexible as an employer. You could say come in whenever you want … or say when you do come in let’s celebrate.”",

        "title": "Ofwat accused of showing ‘contempt’ to customers over water bill price rises",
        "content": "Politicians and campaigners have condemned proposed water bill rises for England and Wales, accusing the industry regulator of showing “contempt” to customers who have endured poor service, sewage dumping and leaks. Ofwat’s recommendation on Thursday that households pay on average £94 more over five years to fund improvements in environmental standards was described as a “bitter pill” by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The regulator also put struggling Thames Water into unprecedented special measures, allowing extra scrutiny of Britain’s biggest supplier, as fears grow over whether it may have to go through a painful restructuring or be temporarily nationalised. The UK’s private water companies have faced a barrage of public anger, after years of taking out millions in bonuses and dividends while underinvesting in an ageing network led to high levels of leaks and sewage overflows. In March, data revealed that untreated human waste was discharged for more than 3.6m hours into rivers and seas last year, up 105% on the previous 12 months. Ofwat’s plans to pay for the necessary repairs by raising household bills were met with anger by activists and politicians. The former Undertones singer turned water campaigner Feargal Sharkey accused the watchdog of charging customers twice by “allowing water companies to put up bills by a large amount to pay for infrastructure they should have already paid for”. Keir Starmer said the Conservatives had let the water industry “get completely out of hand”, and Labour would look at “possible further regulation” to tackle pollution and rising bills. On Thursday, water bosses met the environment secretary, Steve Reed, to promise to fix sewage leaks and serve customers better. Ofwat’s review, its first assessment of English and Welsh water companies’ spending plans for 2025-30, ruled they could spend £88bn over the five-year period, which would be recovered from bills. The figure is £16bn lower than companies had proposed but still raised concerns that consumers were paying the price for previous underinvestment by water companies, which have paid out £78bn in dividends since 1989, and accumulated £60bn in debt. Sharkey added: “I am now so outraged with the contempt Ofwat is showing to customers that we should be taking to the streets outside parliament to show that we will no longer take their greed, their incompetence and their complete and utter disregard for customers and the environment.” The price review was seen as critical for debt-laden Thames Water. Ofwat took the unprecedented step of putting the company into a “turnaround oversight regime”, subjecting it to extra scrutiny and forcing it to regularly report on the progress of moves to reduce sewage spills by 64%, cut leaks by 19% and slash supply interruptions by 66%. The review is seen as unlikely to have improved investor sentiment towards the company, which could be put into a government-handled administration if it fails to raise fresh funds. Such a collapse could mean Thames’s £15.2bn of debts being added to the public purse. Water company executives signed up to a set of reforms after meeting Reed on Thursday. The new measures ensure funding for vital infrastructure is ringfenced for upgrades that benefit consumers and the environment, and is refunded if it is not spent. Companies have also pledged to make the interests of customers and the environment their “primary objective”, and that households and businesses will see compensation for water supply outages double. Consumers will also receive payments if suppliers issue “boil water notices”, as occurred this year when a parasite caused a spate of illness in Devon. Reed said: “The new government will force water companies to tackle illegal sewage dumping into our rivers, lakes and seas. Firm action should have been taken much earlier to ensure money was spent on fixing the sewage system, not siphoned off for bonuses and dividends.” Starmer said Labour was devising a plan to “get to grips” with the governance of water. He said this would not involve nationalising the entire industry, which some campaigners have called for. It would, however, potentially involve more regulation and “something I’m very keen on, which is to have sort of personal responsibility from the top”. The Liberal Democrats called for “insulting price hikes by water companies” to be blocked. Their environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: “It is a national scandal that these disgraced firms are demanding more money from families and pensioners in a cost of living crisis, all while dumping raw sewage into our rivers.” The Environment Agency has previously said water company bosses ought to be jailed for serious pollution. Ofwat belatedly brought in powers to block executive bonuses if a company has committed serious criminal breaches. The water bill rises are expected to pile further pressure on households struggling with the cost of living crisis. Mike Keil, the chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said: “Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them, given some water companies’ track record of failure and poor service.” Doug Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: “It’s now glaringly obvious that these water firms will continue to demand dividends and bonuses for continuing to not do their job for as long as they are allowed to do so. The regulator can’t solve this without full government backing for a more interventionist approach.” The Green MP Siân Berry, the party’s former leader, called for the water companies to be nationalised, saying this would allow government to “invest affordably in the creaking infrastructure without all the harm falling on to our bills”. Ofwat’s chief executive, David Black, said: “Let me be very clear to water companies. We will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers.” Water UK, which represents water companies, reacted angrily to the limits in the planned spending. A spokesperson said: “Today’s announcement is the biggest ever cut in investment by Ofwat. If it doesn’t put this right, Ofwat will be repeating the mistakes of the past.” The body argued that new housing would be blocked, improvements in river water quality would be slowed and water shortages would become more likely if companies were not allowed to spend the more than £100bn they had proposed. Despite this, shares in the listed water companies rose on Thursday, with South West Water’s owner, Pennon, up 11%, indicating investors believe Ofwat’s verdict was positive for the industry. The biggest bill increases Ofwat allowed were for Southern Water, with a £183 rise to £603; Dŵr Cymru in Wales, which will increase bills by £137 to £603, and Hafren Dyfrdwy, whose bills will be rising by £128 to £524. Ofwat said companies would invest £10bn to tackle storm overflows, with a target to reduce spills by 44% from levels in 2021. A string of new environmental targets will be introduced, including tasking companies in England to limit spills to 16 incidents a year by 2029.",

        "title": "Labour faces legal dilemma over plan for immediate ban on new North Sea licences",
        "content": "The Labour government is grappling with a legal dilemma over its plan to impose an immediate ban on new North Sea oil and gas exploration before the industry’s latest licensing round closes. The party swept to power last week with the pledge to end new North Sea exploration licences but its plans have been cast into doubt by the timing of an ongoing licensing round. The new government will need to decide whether or not to cancel the process, which could end up granting a small number of new North Sea licences in breach of its pledge to end new oil and gas exploration. But cancelling the mechanism, which is run by the industry regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), could leave the new government vulnerable to a volley of legal actions from the companies, which may have spent millions preparing their bids. The government is expected to take legal advice on how to implement its North Sea policy, without risking a legal challenge from oil and gas companies, before taking a final decision on the live licensing round. Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, which campaigns against fossil fuels, said it would be “shocking” if a newly elected government failed to deliver on a manifesto pledge to stop North Sea development. “People in this country voted for change, not more of the same rip-off energy system where oil and gas companies walk off with massive profits and we’re all left with higher bills, declining jobs and a worsening climate crisis,” she said. “Finally, we have a government that is prepared to move the UK to a better, fairer energy system,.” Ministers are also under pressure from trade unions to safeguard millions of jobs that rely on the North Sea industry while they switch to greener sectors. The Labour party manifesto said it would “ensure a phased and responsible” transition away from drilling in the North Sea that would recognise “the proud history of our offshore industry and the brilliance of its workforce”. Labour’s pledge to end new North Sea drilling was central to its promise to turn Britain into a clean energy superpower. The party promised to rule out new oil and gas while doubling onshore wind, tripling solar power and quadrupling the UK’s offshore wind power capacity. A government spokesperson said: “As previously stated, we will not issue new licences to explore new fields. We will also not revoke existing oil and gas licences and will manage existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan.” The government was forced to deny reports that the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, had defied his own officials by ordering an immediate ban on new licences, including those still being considered by the regulator. The spokesperson said the report, published in the Daily Telegraph, was a “complete fabrication” which “invents meetings and decisions that have not taken place”. “We are working with the North Sea Transition Authority to ensure a fair and balanced transition in the North Sea,” the spokesperson added. The latest licensing round, which launched in the autumn of 2023, involved 76 oil and gas companies submitting 115 bids to carry out exploration work across 257 “blocks” of the North Sea, Irish Sea and east Atlantic. However, bids for a small number of fields were still awaiting a decision from the NSTA when Rishi Sunak called the snap election in May. In the same month the NSTA said: “Further consideration is being given to a small number of remaining applications and a few more may be offered at a later date.” A spokesperson for the NSTA declined to comment on the regulator’s previous statement. He said: “We follow the policy direction set by the government of the day.”",

        "title": "The best long-term plan for Thames Water is to get it back on the stock market",
        "content": "How bad are things at Thames Water? So bad that Ofwat has invented a new tool – a “turnaround oversight regime” – to get a grip on the financial and operational mess. The regulator’s manoeuvre is clearly justified. The water company, under its umpteenth new chief executive, has just filed (late) a business plan judged “inadequate”. Its board could not provide formal assurance that statutory obligations on environment performance would be met. And remember, Thames has already been abandoned, in effect, by owners who think the firm is “uninvestable”. So, yes, heightened regulatory scrutiny looks like a minimum requirement until a workable solution is found. But the intriguing part was Ofwat’s thinking on how Thames might eventually emerge from special measures. The company will need to show it can maintain “adequate levels of financial resilience”. This could involve “introducing a limit on the amount of debt the company can take on, a separation of the business into two or more water companies, or looking to a public listing to secure additional equity”. The last of those – a return to the stock market – is the one to focus on. If Ofwat has finally concluded that a privatised water system in England and Wales works better if the companies are listed on the London stock market, give thanks. This column has been banging on (repeatedly) about the virtues of a listing. Why? First, stock market investors would never have tolerated the extreme over-leverage that was imposed on Thames after Macquarie bought the company in 2006. You cannot get away with 80%-plus gearing in the public arena. The three firms that still remain on the market – Severn Trent, United Utilities (in the north-west) and Pennon (owner of South West Water) – have never strayed far from regulatory norms of 60%-ish. Second, financial transparency improves on the stock market. You don’t have holding companies in the Cayman Islands, or tax-minimising financing vehicles inserted above the regulated entity. Third, a share price and a six-monthly public reporting cycle provides a warning signal of trouble ahead. Incompetent and failing managements tend to be cleared out earlier. Fourth, a public listing ensures closer proximity to the public: the customers can buy shares if they wish. In the post-Macquarie era, Thames’s ownership consortium has included giant sovereign funds from Abu Dhabi and China, for whom a UK water company is a faraway entry on a spreadsheet. A path back to the stock market for Thames looks far from simple, it should be said. Step one would surely have to involve a debt-for-equity swap to clear the decks and reduce the towering £15.2bn pile of borrowings. The process could happen either voluntarily or be enforced via special administration – one or the other has probably become more likely after Thursday. Nobody should mourn for Thames’s bondholders, who would take a whack in a financial reconstruction: they have also contributed to the soggy disaster. By way of further demonstration of the relative merits of stock market ownership, look at how the quoted firms emerged from Ofwat’s five-yearly review. The business plans of Severn Trent and Pennon were the only two in the sector to be judged “outstanding” and United Utilities got a middle-of-the-pack “standard”. Nobody is pretending the trio is faultless. All have had pollution and leakage woes (United notably at Windermere; Pennon with a diarrhoea and vomiting outbreak in Devon) And some of the executive bonuses are inexplicable (think Liv Garfield at Severn). Stock market ownership is not a cure-all. The point, though, is that the evidence of a couple of decades suggest it is easier to get listed companies to respond to regulatory incentives than unlisted ones. In a privatised system designed to reward relative outperformers, and penalise underperformers, that is an important point. Indeed, there is a fair argument that regulators only truly lost control of the whole privatised show after the take-private leveraged buyout boom of 2004-08. The new Labour government should take note. It is dead set against nationalising water companies – and rightly so. But it would perform a service if it could force more firms back to the stock market.",

        "title": "Thames Water placed in special measures due to ‘significant issues’",
        "content": "The water industry regulator has put Thames Water into unprecedented special measures, allowing extra scrutiny of the struggling water supplier as it faces the prospect of a painful restructuring or temporary nationalisation. Ofwat said on Thursday that the company, which is creaking under £15.2bn of debt, would be placed in a “turnaround oversight regime” and subjected to “heightened regulatory” measures, meaning it must regularly report on the progress of its investment plan. It is the first time a water company has faced such measures and comes amid increased fears the supplier will collapse into a publicly funded administration. The regulator made the announcement as it published its draft review on English and Welsh water companies’ business proposals, which found the Thames plan to be “unsatisfactory”. Ofwat said customers at Britain’s biggest water company, which serves 16 million customers across London and the south-east, would face a 22% increase in their bills over the next five years, a £99 rise to £535. Thames had asked the regulator to raise bills by 44% over the next five years. Overall, the review suggested the average water bill across the companies could rise by 21%, or £94, over the next five years, also to £535. Ofwat’s chief executive, David Black, said of the Thames business plan: “Costs were poorly justified, service levels were unsatisfactory and so that makes our job more challenging.” He said the response to Thames had been “fair” and that it was “up to Thames to convince investors” of its turnaround as it attempts to raise fresh funds. The supplier’s plan was “late” and “incomplete”, said an Ofwat board member, Chris Walters. “Overall, it lacked ambition. Parts of it certainly did not have the assurance of Thames’s own board, and it’s difficult for us to stand behind a plan that a board won’t stand behind.” Thames investors said in March that Ofwat had made the company “uninvestable” as they U-turned on £500m of pledged funding. The company said this week it would approach potential investors this autumn, before the regulator’s final verdict in December. It said this week it had enough cash to fund its operations until next June. However, if it is unsuccessful in raising new funds it could fall into special administration, with the company temporarily nationalised and the bulk of its debts transferred to the state. The Ofwat price review is viewed as crucial in giving certainty over future revenues and returns, but the restrictions on bill increases are unlikely to have boosted Thames’s attractiveness to investors. Anthony Legg, a water industry expert at PA Consulting, said: “It is difficult to see how these measures restore investor confidence or at the same time allow the management team the space to deliver on its turnaround plan. “The possibility of a special administration regime, despite government reluctance, appears to have increased, though this could still be avoided.” Thames had submitted a revised business plan increasing its proposed spending from £18.7bn to £19.8bn. Ofwat said on Thursday the company would only be allowed to spend £16.9bn. Within that sum, more than £3.3bn is contingent on Thames proving it is “ready and able” to make certain investments. Over the next five years, it has been tasked with reducing sewage spills by 64%, cutting leaks by 19% and reducing supply interruptions by two-thirds. As a result of being put into special measures, Thames will have to provide a delivery action plan and regularly report on the progress of its spending programme. It will also have to provide a financial resilience plan and could be scrutinised by an independent monitor, who would be given full access to company information. In order to exit the regime, it will need to show an improvement in its operating performance, delivery of investments and the state of its balance sheet. The company could be limited in the amount of debt it can take on. Ofwat said it had suggested that, in a longer-term scenario, Thames could separate into two or more companies or list on the stock exchange to secure extra equity. A spokesperson for Thames Water said: “Ofwat has asked us to look again at our turnaround plan, and is seeking enhanced oversight of our delivery against it. We are in any case taking stock of our turnaround plan under our new leadership and reflecting on our progress to date. “We will consider all of Ofwat’s proposals as we go through this process. This is one stage in a longer process.” Ofwat said it was asking “further questions” about a dividend payment of more than £150m, first revealed by the Guardian. Thames has said the dividend did not reach external shareholders. Black said: “We will want to get further confidence that that is the nature of those payments and whether customers’ interests have been protected.”",

        "content": "Water bills in England and Wales will rise by an average of £94 over the next five years, under plans set out by the regulator and described by the chancellor as “a bitter pill” for households. Rachel Reeves said the planned 21% increase to an average of £535 a year reflected “14 years of failure from the Conservatives” amid the sewage pollution scandal and cost of living crisis. Britain’s water companies have signed up to the government’s initial package of reforms for the sector, the environment secretary Steve Reed said after meeting with executives from 16 companies. He blamed the previous government for the current mess: “Today’s water bill rises are the result of years of failure.” The water industry regulator has put Thames Water into unprecedented special measures, allowing extra scrutiny of the struggling water supplier as it faces the prospect of a painful restructuring or temporary nationalisation.

The UK economy returned to growth in May after a washout month in April when activity flatlined, resuming the recovery from last year’s recession. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show gross domestic product rose by 0.4% month on month, double what City economists had forecast, after recording zero growth in April when wet weather hit consumer spending. In the first week since Labour’s election landslide, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has promised to reboot the economy by making it the new government’s “national mission” to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. – JK James McCann, deputy chief economist at the investment company abrdn said: The Fed will enjoy reading the June CPI report. Headline prices fell by 0.1%m/m and core prices increased just 0.1%m/m, both comfortably below expectations. Indeed, this was the weakest monthly core inflation reading in more than three years and suggests the central bank is back on track with regards to hitting its inflation target. The news was pretty good across the board. Core goods prices were down again, helped by lower autos prices, with deflation in this sector having clearly resumed following a brief halt earlier this year. Otherwise, core services prices were up just 0.1%m/m, helped by much weaker shelter inflation. We of course have been waiting for the moderation in market rents to feed into these official measures and this is a tantalising signal that this might be more definitively playing out. Other services inflation meanwhile was negative for a second consecutive month, with air fares providing another huge contribution to this weakness. The bump in Q1 inflation is increasingly looking like a blip and the Fed should be increasingly confident that it can start to cut rates. This easing looks increasingly timely as activity and labor market indicators start to slow. Indeed, amid softer price pressures the Fed is likely to start to turn its attention to ensuring that this slide does not turn into a rout.” Separate US figures showed the number of new jobless claims dipped by 17,000 to 222,000 and continuing claims held stable. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, has crunched the inflation figures: US CPI came in below expectations, which should increase the Fed’s confidence that inflation is on the path to sustainably reaching the 2% target. September rate cut chances are rising and so too is our belief that the Fed will cut rates three times this year rather than by just the two cuts priced by markets… We are finally seeing housing inflation slow with shelter coming in at 0.2% month on month rather than the 0.4% rate it has been trending at. Owners’ equivalent rent and primary rent were 0.3% MoM, the lowest for three years, while hotel prices fell sharply… Between now and then [September] we expect to see more evidence of a cooling jobs market and decelerating consumer spending growth. With the Fed keen to avoid a recession and achieve the targeted “soft landing” we think the Jackson Hole Conference at the end of August will be the venue for the Fed to signal more explicitly that interest rate cuts are coming. We continue to see three rate cuts this year versus the market pricing of two. Washington Post columnist and editorial board member Heather Long said: US inflation has come in lower than expected, boosting hopes of an interest rate cut in September. The headline annual inflation rate eased to 3% in June, the lowest in a year, and down from 3.4% in May, according to official figures . Economists had expected inflation to fall to 3.1%. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index dropped by 0.1% in June from May, versus expectations of a 0.1% rise. The annual core inflation rate, which strips out energy and food and is closely watched by the US Federal Reserve, dipped to 3.3%. Analysts had expected it to stay at 3.4%. Fund manager Jeroen Blokland said on X: Britain’s water companies have signed up to the government’s initial package of reforms for the sector, the environment secretary Steve Reed said after meeting with executives from 16 companies. After meetings with water bosses this afternoon, they have now signed up to my initial package of reforms as we work towards cleaning up our water, prioritising the interests of water customers and the environment, and fixing our broken sewage system. He also said: Today’s water bill rises are the result of years of failure. The new government will force water companies to tackle illegal sewage dumping into our rivers, lakes and seas. Firm action should have been taken much earlier to ensure money was spent on fixing the sewerage system, not syphoned off for bonuses and dividends. The decisive steps set out today mean this will never be allowed to happen again. David Henderson, chief executive of the trade association Water UK, said the industry will work with government to implement the reforms rapidly. We welcome today’s swift action by the Secretary of State. Companies have agreed to his direction that, in addition to turbocharging investment, they put customers and the environment at the core of how they operate. We will work with government to implement these reforms as quickly as possible and deliver our largest-ever investment plan to secure our water supplies, end sewage in rivers and enable economic growth. Ed Miliband has reportedly ordered an immediate ban on new drilling in the North Sea in a move that overrules his own officials and threatens to trigger a wave of legal action. The new energy secretary has told regulators not to approve a new round of drilling licences that was expected to get the go-ahead in the coming weeks, the Daily Telegraph reported. His decision means that companies will have wasted millions of pounds putting together their bids, and could take legal action. The decision followed crisis meetings yesterday between Miliband and his aides after The Telegraph asked for updates on outstanding drilling licence applications. Our environment reporter Helena Horton has spoken to Feargal Sharkey, water campaigner and former Undertones frontman. He said: This ruling is not particularly impressive if you’re a water customer. As much as today was a referendum about the water industry’s future, it’s a decision about Ofwat’s future - that’s because it doesn’t have one, as yet again it has demonstrated it has no empathy whatosever for the rage and anger that persists across the nation and they simply continue to treat the environment and customers with utter contempt. They are allowing water companies to put up bills by a large amount to pay for infrastructure they should have already paid for with customer bills. Customers are therefore having to pay twice. Sharkey said he is planning to march on parliament in disgust. I am now so outraged with the contempt Ofwat is showing to customers that we should be taking to the streets outside parliament to show that we will no longer take their greed, their incompetence and their complete and utter disregard for customers and the environment. It is a date yet to be set, but probably late October. The Green Party has called for water companies to be taken into public ownership. Green MP Siân Berry, the party’s former leader, said: Once this is done, government can invest affordably in the creaking infrastructure without all the harm falling on to our bills, and into our rivers and oceans that are currently being treated as open sewers. James Wallace, who runs the campaign group River Action James Wallace said: These bill hikes punish households struggling with the cost-of-living crisis for the abject failure of greedy water companies to invest in their crumbling infrastructure and reduce record sewage spills. For decades the industry has put profit before the environment, rewarding its shareholders with billions in dividends, and in the process filling our rivers with human sewage. We must fix this national embarrassment of systemic sewage pollution which has caused environmental carnage to our rivers. The singer and clean water campaigner Feargal Sharkey has welcomed this afternoon’s meeting between the environment secretary, Steve Reed, and the chief executives of all water companies in England and Wales, saying on X yesterday: Here is more reaction to the £94 average rise in water bills in England and Wales in the next five years, proposed by the regulator Ofwat. Giles Bristow, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: The general election campaign made clear that the public is fed up with those in power turning a blind eye to the sewage scandal. Unfortunately today’s announcement, in which Ofwat accepts that we will all have to swim and surf in sewage way beyond 2030, does nothing to change that. Signing off on the continuation of at least 200,000 sewage discharges a year is simply unacceptable and a sign that the regulator still doesn’t comprehend the scale of public fury on this issue. He called for the new Labour government to launch a public inquiry as the only way to “help us understand how we got here and how we can dig our way out”. Paul de Zylva, from Friends of the Earth, said the decision on bills and investment “yet again proves that our current form of water privatisation is not fit for purpose”. It sees water companies pile pressure on Ofwat to allow them to hike customers’ bills to subsidise long-overdue investment in our crumbling sewage infrastructure which might cut or prevent some, but by no means all, pollution.” While he said Ofwat’s draft determination shows it is not pandering to everything water companies want, many will still see the increase in bills as “unfair”. He called on the government to provide greater funding for the Environment Agency, which is tasked with regulating the environmental actions of water companies, and put a “green duty” on Ofwat alongside its environmental focus, as well as impose tougher sanctions on “irresponsible” water firms. Here is Thames Water’s response to today’s Ofwat announcement. Britain’s biggest water company said it had put forward an “ambitious plan” to Ofwat, asking for £19.8bn of total expenditure to maintain reliable supplies of safe drinking water and to deal with wastewater across London, the Thames Valley and Home Counties. Within this we put forward record investment to improve infrastructure, meet new environmental standards and reduce river pollution. Our plan will also improve the resilience of our critical infrastructure in the face of challenges such as climate change and population growth. We believe our plan is ambitious, deliverable, financeable and investible. It is also underpinned by a package to support over 500,000 customers with reduced bills. Ofwat’s draft determination understandably challenges us on efficiency and delivery. They have been thoughtful in considering the funding we need for our day to day running costs and the improvements our customers and communities want to see. Although Ofwat currently categorises our business plan as ‘inadequate,’ this judgment rests on over 20 very specific tests around the scope of information to be provided, and evidence required to depart from Ofwat’s own assumptions. Ofwat has made clear it will revisit its view if we provide further evidence to reach a final determination that is, in the round, affordable for customers, deliverable, financeable, as well as investable. We welcome the opportunity to provide Ofwat with further evidence about the need for the investment we plan to make, our costs and how we will deliver it. It said it was “taking stock of our turnaround plan under our new leadership”. Chris Weston, a former British Gas executive, was appointed as its new boss in December, replacing Sarah Bentley, and started in January. Thames said it will respond to Ofwat by 28 August, and the regulator will make a final determination in December. The pound hit a four-month high after the better-than-expected UK GDP figures, which showed the economy grew by 0.4% in May following zero growth in April. Economists say this suggests that in the second quarter it grew at a similar rate to the first quarter’s 0.7%. Sterling rose by 0.2% to $1.2879. European shares are rising ahead of the US inflation figures for June, out at lunchtime. The FTSE 100 index is 31 points, or 0.4%, higher at 8,224, with water companies Severn Trent and United Utilities leading the gains, up 3.2% and 2.6% respectively. The German and Italian markets edged 0.16% higher while the French index climbed by 0.5%. Headline inflation in the US is expected to have eased to 3.1% in June from 3.3% in May, while core inflation, which strips out energy and food, is forecast to have stayed at 3.4%. In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, inflation eased to 2.5% in June from 2.8% in May, according to final official figures, leaving the door open for an interest rate cut from the European Central Bank in September. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: The new government has placed economic growth at the heart of its policies and it will be pleased to have inherited positive momentum with GDP. The bigger issue is whether the Bank of England will look at this data and feel less inclined to cut rates. After all, cutting rates is something a central bank does to stimulate a lacklustre economy, not grease the wheels for one already moving ahead. That said, momentum could easily lose pace, particularly if the jobs market weakens and sticky inflation causes consumers to stay cautious on spending. A stronger pound has traditionally been unfavourable for the FTSE 100 given many of its constituents earn in US dollars. That factor was given a backseat as utilities, miners and big consumer brand companies including Diageo and Unilever helped to push the index higher. The water industry regulator has put Thames Water into special measures giving it extra scrutiny of the struggling water supplier, as it faces the prospect of a painful restructuring or temporary nationalisation. Ofwat said today that Thames, Britain’s biggest water company, would be placed in a “turnaround oversight regime” and subject to “heightened regulatory” measures, meaning the company must regularly report on the progress of its investment plan. The regulator made the announcement as it published its draft review on English and Welsh water companies’ business plans which showed bills will rise by £94 on average in England and Wales over the next five years. The plans proposed sums which companies intend to charge customers between 2025 and 2030. The review said Thames customers will face a 22% increase in their bills over the next five years. Ofwat said Thames would be allowed to increase bills by £99 to £535, £92 less than the company had proposed. Thames, which serves 16 million customers across London and the south-east, had asked the regulator to raise bills by 44% over the next five years. The price review is seen as crucial for the future of Thames Water, which is creaking under £15.2bn of debt. The company said this week that, after the review, it would approach potential investors this autumn, before Ofwat’s final verdict in December. Over the next five years, Thames has been tasked with reduce sewage spills by 64%, cutting leaks by 19% and reducing supply interruptions by two-thirds. The regulator said: Thames Water faces significant issues and as it seeks to tackle them, our draft determinations will support a major investment programme but also subject the company to new, heightened regulatory measures. As a result of being put into the regime, Thames will have to provide a “delivery action plan” and regularly report on the progress of its spending programme. Shares in several water companies have risen and are leading gains on the FTSE 100 index this morning, following the Ofwat announcement that water bills in England and Wales will rise by an average of £94 over the next five years, in plans set out by the regulator. Severn Trent and United Utilities are the top two risers on the FTSE 100, up by 2.9% and 2.3% respectively. The index rose by 18 points, or 0.2%, overall to 82,12. Germany’s Dax rose by 0.3%, France’s CAC climbed by 0.5% and Italy’s FTSE MiB edged by 0.1% higher. FTSE 250-listed Pennon Group jumped 6.4% this morning. The Exeter-based utility said its finance chief Steve Buck was stepping down for personal reasons, after nearly a year in the role. He will be succeeded by Laura Flowerdew, a company insider and previously chief financial officer at Bristol Water. Ahead of his meeting with the bosses of all 16 water suppliers in England and Wales this afternoon, Steve Reed, the UK environment secretary, announced a series of “initial steps towards ending the crisis in the water sector”. He has written to Ofwat, asking the water regulator to ensure funding for vital infrastructure investment is ringfenced and can only be spent on upgrades benefiting customers and the environment. He also wants Ofwat to ensure that when money for investment is not spent, companies refund customers, with money never allowed to be diverted for bonuses, dividends or salary increases. He wants water companies to change their Articles of Association, the rules governing each company, to make the interests of customers and the environment the primary objective. Consumers will gain new powers to hold water company bosses to account through “powerful new customer panels,” the government said. For the first time in history, customers will have the power to summon board members and hold water executives to account. Strengthened protection and compensation for households and businesses when their basic water services are affected. Subject to consultation, the amount of compensation customers are legally entitled to when key standards are not met will more than double. The payments will also be triggered by a wider set of circumstances including Boil Water Notices. Reed said: We will never look the other way while water companies pump sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas. This unacceptable destruction of our waterways should never have been allowed, but change has now begun so it can never happen again. Today I have announced significant steps to clean up the water industry to cut sewage pollution, protect customers and attract investment to upgrade its crumbling infrastructure. That change will take time. Over the coming weeks and months, this government will outline further steps to reform the water sector and restore our rivers, lakes and seas to good health. Water UK, the trade body for the water industry, said the Ofwat announcement amounts to the “biggest ever cut in investment” in water and sewage infrastructure . A spokesperson said: If it doesn’t put this right Ofwat will be repeating the mistakes of the past. As a direct result, more housing will be blocked, the recovery of our rivers will be slower and we will fail to deal with the water shortages we know are coming. Water companies proposed to invest £105bn because it is the minimum needed to meet the legitimate concerns we’ve heard from the public about our environment and our economy. Ofwat is right to want to ensure customers receive value for money and that is why protections are in place to ensure customers only pay for projects that are new, necessary and value for money. But for far too long, Ofwat has failed to be realistic about the levels of investment needed and what it will take to deliver and maintain necessary infrastructure. We cannot allow this pattern to repeat itself. Water companies are ready to invest in an unprecedented overhaul of the country’s water and sewage infrastructure. Ofwat now needs to let them get on with it. Meanwhile, Alan Lovell, chair of the Environment Agency, hailed Ofwat’s planned 21% average rise in water bills in England and Wales as a “significant step forward in delivering the investment needed to protect rivers and seas, boost water supplies and improve resilience to flooding”. Water companies have faced sustained criticism over leaky pipes, sewage dumping and extracted dividends in recent years. Lovell said: It will deliver four times more investment in clean and plentiful water than the previous five-year period. The critical issue now is delivery. We will be playing our part to make sure the industry steps up on the environment. We are taking forward our biggest ever transformation in the way we regulate, recruiting up to 500 additional staff, increasing compliance checks and quadrupling the number of water company inspections by March next year. Our job is to make sure the water companies do what they say they will do, and people begin to see a difference in their water environment. Bills will rise for customers of all water companies in England and Wales, apart from those of Wessex Water and Sutton and East Surrey Water. Mike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, a government-funded body, said: Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies’ track record of failure and poor service. Becky Malby of the Ilkley Clean River Group campaign in west Yorkshire, which wants to secure bathing water status for a river in England, said Ofwat had gone back on its promises. A year ago, David Black, the CEO at Ofwat wrote to the Ilkey Clean River Group saying “We are firm in our commitment to ensuring that the customer should not pay twice for a company’s shortfall.” In addition he stated that “We are determined to use all the regulatory powers as fully as possible to improve the performance of water companies for customers and the environment.“ Today Ofwat announced a bill rise of £107 BEFORE inflation by 2029/30, for Yorkshire Water customers, amounting to an additional £9 per month + inflation. Our water system is at breaking point. The additional price increase secures a basic functioning sewage system here at Ilkley and is in direct contradiction to David Black’s promise. We are, after all, being told to pay twice. Construction output rebounded in May, today’s ONS figures showed. This week, the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, unveiled a number of measures aimed at getting “Britain building again”. Clive Docwra, managing director of property and construction consultancy McBains, said: After previous statistics showed the construction sector lagging behind the modest uptick in growth witnessed in other industries, today’s figures are much better than expected. Especially welcome is that growth was experienced across most work sectors, with new housing seeing a 2.8% increase. Whether or not this represents the green shoots of recovery, however, is unclear. Over the three months to May output still decreased by 0.7%, showing that growth is still fragile. Despite these returns, the sector still needs a shot in the arm, and developers will hope Labour’s announcement this week to get the country building translates into renewed confidence from investors, both in housing and commercial projects. Every sector within the industry will also be crossing their fingers for a period of economic stability to help construction across the board get back on track. The UK economy springs back into life – it is faring much better so far in 2024 after a technical recession last year. James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, said: The result is that overall second-quarter GDP is on track to rise by 0.5-0.6% after 0.7% growth in the first quarter. We’re sceptical that these sort of growth figures can be sustained into the second half of the year, but we expect growth to remain reasonable nevertheless. One important factor is that the impact of past rate hikes has largely taken its course now; we estimate that 80% of the mortgage squeeze is behind us. Does this change the story for the Bank of England? Probably not. Policymakers are still almost exclusively focused on services inflation, and it’s the one remaining release of this data that will determine whether the Bank can cut rates in August. Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill, perhaps unsurprisingly, refused to be drawn on what he thought in comments made yesterday. But barring any big surprises in those inflation numbers, we think the Bank’s preference will be to start cutting rates and we expect three cuts in total this year. Another upside surprise for UK GDP in May means that second-quarter growth is likely to be close to the first quarter’s strong expansion, despite drags from the early Easter and strikes in the health sector. “The recovery has clearly built some strong momentum in the first half,” said the EY Item Club, which uses the Treasury’s forecasting model. It expects GDP to continue to grow at a decent pace in the second half, with consumers central to the story. Further solid gains in household spending power look likely, and if consumers adopt a less cautious approach, in line with recent household survey results, we can expect a strong pickup in consumer spending growth. Peter Arnold, EY UK chief economist, said: Four days of strike action in the healthcare sector at the end of June will have weighed on output last month. But even allowing for that factor, GDP is likely to have grown by at least 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in Q2. Indeed, there’s a realistic possibility that Q2 could have matched the 0.7% growth achieved in Q1, so it’s clear that the recovery has built some strong momentum. The EY ITEM Club’s expectation that GDP continues to grow at a decent pace in H2 is founded mostly on optimism about consumer prospects. Lower inflation and still strong pay growth should combine to deliver further solid improvements in household spending power. Thus far, strong real income growth has only translated into a tepid recovery in spending as consumers have remained cautious. But there are signs from consumer surveys that the mood is changing, and the EY Item Club is optimistic that further real income gains will translate into a more meaningful pickup in spending growth in H2. Simon French, chief economist and head of research at Panmure Liberum, said: Here is our full story on water bills. Back to the UK economy returning to growth in May, which is a boon for Keir Starmer’s government. Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist of Deutsche Bank, noted that GDP surprised to the upside yet again, expanding by 0.4% month on month, driven by stronger services activity and construction output. While the warmest May on record may have helped activity in the services and construction sectors, UK GDP is now undeniably picking up steam. The short-lived recession is now very much behind us. It’s now likely that Q2 growth could come close to the mark set in Q1 (our current nowcast models point to a 0.6% quarter-on-quarter reading with risks skewed to the upside). Equally, upside risks to our 2024 growth projection of 0.8% are also now crystallising. This should be a boon for the new Labour government with growth now likely to outstrip the Office for Budget Responsibility’s 2024 GDP forecasts, partially offsetting some of the projected increase in interest rate costs. We will update our growth projections soon. During the general election, the Liberal Democrats called for Ofwat to be abolished and a new water regulator to be established with greater powers. Today, the Lib Dems are calling on Ofwat use its existing powers to crack down on large water bill rises. The party is also calling on the government to implement a ban on water company executive bonuses until discharges and leaks end. The Lib Dems’ environment spokesperson Tim Farron said: Any insulting price hikes by water companies must be blocked. It is a national scandal that these disgraced firms are demanding more money from families and pensioners in a cost of living crisis, all whilst dumping raw sewage into our rivers. After years of Conservative Ministers letting these shameful polluters get away with it, we now need tough action, starting with a ban on bonuses and a block on large bill hikes. Communities spoke loudly at the election, demanding an end to the sewage scandal and water firms stuffing their pockets with bonuses and dividends. The government and regulator must listen to the country. In return for being able to increase their bills, water companies must invest in the following, the regulator said: Improving the environment Delivering more than 2,500 projects to reduce spills from storm overflows Upgrading over 1,500 wastewater treatment works Improving or protecting over 15,000km of rivers across England and Wales Expanding use of nature-based solutions – with £2bn of green schemes proposed Putting the sector on track to meet net zero emissions by 2050 Improving service Improving drinking water quality – targeting 21% fewer contacts received by water companies Stretching targets on reducing sewer flooding Better customer service incentives – companies only rewarded for good customer service compared to other sectors Protecting our water and wastewater system A major expansion in new water assets, including nine new reservoirs and progressing seven large-scale water transfer projects Delivering 425 million extra litres of water supply per day by 2030 Getting leakage down by a further 13% – to the lowest level since privatisation The biggest smart meter rollout to date, with 10 million to be delivered Tripling the rate of replacing water mains The water regulator said companies should triple investment in new infrastructure and resources compared to 2020-25, to improve the environment, resilience, and service – from £11bn to £35bn. Nearly 90% of this investment is needed to meet legal requirements. Ofwat added: Companies have proposed increased support for those struggling to pay, with an estimated 1.4 million more customers to pay reduced tariffs. The increases in average water bills range from £66 at Anglian Water over the next five years, £99 at Thames Water, £107 at Yorkshire Water and £199 at Southern Water. Despite the increases, water bills bills are on average £44 per year lower than what companies proposed, Ofwat said in its draft determinations for the water industry. This is mainly because we have challenged companies’ view of what they need to spend, and because some companies based their plans on an investor return above the level we think is fair. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. England are through to the final in the euro men’s football tournament, and the UK economy has returned to growth. In other news, the average water bill is set to rise by £94 over the next five years in England and Wales, the water regulator Ofwat said. The 21% increase, or £19 a year on average, is intended to fund investment at water companies for improvements such as fixing leaking pipes and tackling the discharge of sewage into rivers and seas. Is is lower than water companies had asked for. The UK economy grew by 0.4% in May after showing no growth in April, resuming its recovery from last year’s recession, according to official figures. April was a very wet month, putting consumers off from spending on the high street. The outcome is better than the 0.2% growth forecast by econommists. GDP grew by 0.9% in the three months to May compared with the the three months to February, driven by 1.1% expansion in services output, according to the Office for National Statistics. In May alone, services output rose by 0.3%, the same rate as in April (revised up from 0.2%), and was the biggest contributor to growth. Production output grew by 0.2% in May following a drop of 0.9% in April, and posted zero growth in the three months to May. Construction output grew by 1.9% in May, following a fall of 1.1% in April (revised higher from a fall of 1.4%), and declined by 0.7% in the three months to May.

        "content": "Jet2 has said price rises for its flights and package holidays will be “modest” over the summer, as it tries to adjust to a trend for late booking in which customers are waiting much longer to buy tickets. The Leeds-based company – which flies from 12 UK airports to more than 65 destinations in Europe – said that it was conscious of the pressure on consumers, and that although it was having to raise prices, its deals would remain “attractive”. “Passengers are currently booking much closer to departure and therefore pricing for our flight-only and package holiday products must remain attractive,” Jet2 said. The company said it had already raised the price of its package holidays by 11% to £830, on average, over the year as it tried to cover its own rising costs. “As ever, we remain mindful of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environments and how these may influence future consumer spending patterns,” the company added. “However, we continue to believe that the end-to-end package holiday is a resilient and popular product which remains high on the priority list for our customers, even during uncertain economic times.” The group reported a 43% jump in profits on Thursday to £530m for the year to March, as passenger numbers rose 9% to a record 17.7 million. There will be some relief for holidaymakers flying out of Heathrow, after the UK regulator said it would be forcing the airport to make further cuts to passenger charges over the next two years. The Civil Aviation Authority said Heathrow would probably have to reduce the per-passenger fee – the amount charged to airlines for each traveller they carry – by about 6% over the next two years, to £23.73 in 2025 and £23.71 in 2026. That is only down marginally from the £25.24 cap set for this year but the issue is complicated by the fact that Heathrow had originally tried to increase the fee to £40, before losing an appeal with the competitions regulator. Heathrow said it had experienced its busiest day ever on 30 June as more than 268,000 passengers passed through the airport – a contrast to the hit from the Covid lockdowns, for which it had been hoping to compensate through higher charges. The chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, said: “June has seen more Heathrow records shattered including serving more passengers in a single day than ever before … We have started summer as we mean to go on.”",

        "title": "‘A lazy solution’: Etsy sellers say ban on sex toys is a betrayal",
        "content": "Etsy has always been a home for sellers of bespoke, artisanal and alternative items – including erotic jewellery and sex toys. But as of next month, some of these companies will be kicked off the platform, which they see as a betrayal of Etsy’s sizeable sex-positive community. From 29 July, Etsy will ban the sale of sex toys, such as dildos and vibrators as well as “printed or visual materials” that exist for “the purpose of sexual arousal or stimulation”, including old Playboy issues and vintage adult magazines, and anything printed with sexual slogans related to “daddy” or “mommy”. The new policy is the company’s attempt to “continue to keep our users safe”, wrote Alice Wu, the head of Etsy’s trust and safety team, in a public letter. Sellers see this as a betrayal, according to Alexandra Houston, the founder of London-based e-commerce platform Charmskool, which specialises in fetish apparel and accessories. Since the announcement, she has seen an influx of former Etsy users to her platform. “The huge crushing disappointment is that a previous ally [Etsy] is turning its back on this community without so much as an apology,” she said. “Imagine if you have been trading on Etsy for the last 10 years … it’s like having your house burnt down.” The company now catered “to the mass market”, Houston said. “Etsy wants anything creative as long as it is beige, and middle of the road. It doesn’t want anything risque any more.” Preston Stevenson and Laura Norden, who have been selling handmade dildos and other sex toys from Ohio since 2018, agree. “The ban will essentially close the doors of many handmade makers in the adult toy realm like ourselves. For small shops like ours who have spent the majority of their time on the Etsy platform, 30 days’ notice is simply not enough time to pivot either to a new shop home with the same amount of traffic or exposure or ramp up in-person sales,” Stevenson said. “Bans like this one also further the idea that sexual health and pleasure is somehow taboo or something to be ashamed of. It has broader impacts on society as a whole.” The founders of Simply Elegant Glass, which makes sex toys, posted an open letter to Etsy on X, noting it was already hard to run an adult business, since most payment processors “have prurient clauses and won’t work with us”. They wrote: “Protecting children from adult content is a noble interest and we agree that it should be pursued – no question whatsoever. That’s not an honest framing of what you’re doing here, though, is it? “A blanket ban is a lazy solution to the problems of non-compliance and non-enforcement that you [Etsy] … created in the first place. It’s a solution that targets buyer retention and that appeases investors and advertisers. It’s a bad solution – even when framed around ‘safety’.” Simply Elegant Glass said it had been a “loyal Etsy seller since 2015, selling artistic, handmade, one-of-a-kind goods”, with 5,000 shop followers and hundreds of five-star reviews. Etsy introduced cost-cutting measures last year, including laying off 225 workers. It faces growing competition from websites such as Temu and Shein, which sell products at cheaper prices. It also reported first-quarter profits of $63m (£49m), down more than $11 from the year before, due to weak consumer demand. It is understood the decision by Etsy is to promote user safety and not for financial benefit. Etsy did not provide a comment.",

        "title": "Surprise growth boost for Labour as GDP rises by 0.4% in May",
        "content": "The UK economy returned to growth in May after a washout month in April when activity flatlined, resuming the recovery from last year’s recession. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show gross domestic product rose by 0.4% month on month, double what City economists had forecast, after recording zero growth in April when wet weather hit consumer spending. In the first week since Labour’s election landslide, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has promised to reboot the economy by making it the new government’s “national mission” to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7. Growth was widespread in May across all main sectors of the economy. The ONS said retailers had a good month, bouncing back from a weak April, while strength in housebuilding and infrastructure helped construction grow at the fastest rate in almost a year. Manufacturing also grew, led by the food and drink industry. Over the three months to the end of May the economy grew by 0.9%, the fastest rate for more than two years. Keir Starmer has become prime minister as the economy recovers from a brief and shallow recession at the end of last year, when households cut back their spending amid the cost of living crisis. Rishi Sunak had argued during the election campaign that the economy had “turned a corner” under the Conservatives. Growth returned in the first quarter of this year, with the economy expanding by 0.7%. However, it flatlined in April, the first month of the second quarter, as wet weather deterred consumers from spending on the high street, while millions of households remain under pressure amid the cost of living crisis. Inflation has returned to the government’s 2% target after a prolonged period of soaring price rises and a peak inflation rate of 11.1% in October 2022 – its highest level in 41 years. As inflation comes down, the Bank of England is expected to start cutting interest rates, possibly as soon as next month, in a move that will provide relief and hope for households facing sharply higher mortgage costs. However, markets predict the Bank’s next meeting in August is on a knife-edge, after comments by policymakers this week warning that persistent inflationary pressures could warrant a cautious approach. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: “These GDP figures may make an August rate cut less likely by providing those rate setters, who are concerned about underlying price pressures, with sufficient confidence about the UK’s economic recovery to continue putting off loosening policy.” Reeves said the government had “taken the urgent action necessary to fix the foundations of our economy to rebuild Britain and make every part of Britain better off. A decade of national renewal has begun, and we are just getting started.” The latest figures show growth was led by a robust 0.3% month on month expansion in the service sector, which accounts for most the British economy, in a fifth consecutive month of recovery. This was driven by growth of 2.9% in the retail trade, after a fall of 1.8% in April. The hospitality sector also bounced back after a washout April, mainly coming from hotels, and to a lesser extent restaurants and pubs. Breweries also had a positive month. It comes after UK overall rainfall in April was 155% of the long-term average, while May was the warmest on record since records began in 1884. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said while the near-term outlook for the economy had improved, there were still challenges for the government to address. “The longer-term outlook for productivity in both the public and private sectors, key drivers of long-term growth prospects, remains weak. The announcement this week of supply side reforms by the new government is encouraging, but these policies, if successful, will take time to alter the long-term growth trajectory.”",

        "title": "London stock market rules shaken up in attempt to stop firms moving overseas",
        "content": "The City watchdog will trigger the biggest shake-up of London stock market rules in more than 30 years this month, in an attempt to make the UK a more attractive place to list shares. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirmed on Thursday it would streamline and loosen rules for listed companies on 29 July, after months of hand-wringing over an exodus of companies from the London Stock Exchange for rival financial hubs. The revamped rules will scrap the UK’s two-tier system of standard and premium listings. The premium listing heaped extra requirements on companies in exchange for a more prestigious label and entry into FTSE-branded indices. Ditching the premium label means companies will no longer have to hold shareholder votes before approving large mergers or takeovers. While current rules have been criticised by some for delaying or increasing the cost of standard deals meant to help companies grow, the change has raised concerns about eroding shareholder democracy. Companies will soon operate under one set of rules, simplifying what some industry bodies have claimed was a “complex” and costly listing regime. “Our aim is to encourage a wider range of companies to choose to list, raise capital and grow in the UK, while maintaining high standards of market integrity and consumer protection,” said the FCA’s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi. The changes are a result of recommendations put forward in 2021 by Jonathan Hill, a former EU commissioner for finance. The FCA has already slashed the proportion of shares that must be offered to outside investors from 25% to 10%, and allows companies to issue dual-class shares that give founders more control of listed firms, in response to Lord Hill’s report. Both sets of rules came into force in December 2021. It is also hoped that the latest changes reduce the number of companies leaving or snubbing London for overseas rivals, including the US. “The need for change is clear and widely acknowledged,” Rathi said. “The risk otherwise is that our regime falls increasingly out of step with those of other jurisdictions, making it less likely that companies eager to grow choose the UK as a place to list their shares.” The investment platform AJ Bell said the overhaul came with “some serious potential negatives”. “The government is clearly desperate to bolster UK listings as part of efforts to revitalise the City of London,” said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell. “The FCA’s reforms risk diluting the quality of the UK stock market to a house made out of balsa wood. This includes giving shareholders less of a voice on matters like acquisitions, even though they are a company’s owners.” In May, the owner of Paddy Power, Flutter, announced it would switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London. The British fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown said in June it would accept a proposed offer from private equity investors, which would leave another hole in the FTSE 100 index.",

        "content": "Government officials who tour Coppermills, a vast Thames Water treatment works in north-east London, are left under no illusions about the dire condition of Britain’s infrastructure. “It’s in a shocking state,” said one official who has visited the 1960s site, which supplies approximately a third of the capital’s population with drinking water and sewage services. “It’s a slow-motion management disaster.” Thames has publicly admitted that Coppermills is in such poor condition that it could be a “point of failure”, leading to prolonged water supply disruption for more than 500,000 people. Coppermills is just one corner of a huge, decaying empire that serves 16 million customers across London and the Thames Valley. Evidence of that decay has become all too frequent: from the rivers clouded with sewage when it rains, and the burst pipes and water mains, to the threatened water shortages when the sun shines. A slow-moving crisis that has engulfed Thames has left it teetering on the brink of a painful restructuring, or even a temporary renationalisation. Thames has also become a powerful totem of mismanagement, corporate greed and lax regulatory oversight. And for a new Labour government coming to terms with its economic inheritance, Thames is a timebomb that is about to detonate. New breed of investors The roots of that decay can be traced back more than two decades. In the early 2000s, as the government prepared to shunt two renationalised companies, Railtrack and British Energy, back into private hands, the message to regulators was clear: play nice and do not put off foreign investors. It was against this backdrop of light-touch regulation that Macquarie, which started out as a small Australian merchant bank in the 1960s, decided to buy Thames Water in 2006. Britain’s privatisation wave, kicked off by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, was entering a new phase. The early owners were cashing in their lucrative investments, and a new breed of financially savvy investors was circling. The Macquarie-led consortium outmuscled investment heavyweights – including the gas-rich state of Qatar and Guy Hands’s Terra Firma – to land the £8bn acquisition from German’s RWE. Macquarie pruned costs ruthlessly. Thames Water lifer Cliff Roney, who had a four-decade career within the company before retiring in 2018, recalls a perceptible shift when it took over from RWE. “When Macquarie arrived, they presented a glossy presentation to us, promising investment in assets and staff. Within months, it was clear we’d been sold a pup,” he says. “Some important sites needed in case of water shortages were sold off. They were so tight on spending, you could barely order a box of pens. All the skills were contracted out – we had electricians, blacksmiths, window fitters – they were all outsourced under Macquarie.” Parsimony even extended to the boardroom – although not where pay was concerned. When Martin Baggs left his job running Thames Water in late 2016, he might have expected a lavish celebration, or at least a gold watch. Baggs had spent seven years as chief executive churning out profits and dividends for Macquarie. But in recognition of his service, Baggs and his top team were each presented with a tea towel. “It had self-portraits drawn by the directors – they didn’t even pay for a designer to create them,” says a former Thames executive. “Macquarie ran a very tight ship: if money didn’t need to be spent, it wasn’t.” They added: “I’m not saying they’re not the bad guys in this, but they were responsible in the core running of the company. If you needed to buy vital chemicals, you could buy them – you just couldn’t buy any more than was absolutely necessary. It was all very precise. They would not leave any dividends if that could be taken out.” Hollowed out But money was flowing, elsewhere. A £656m dividend was extracted in the first year of Macquarie’s stewardship, in 2007, dwarfing the company’s profits of £241m. Thames churned out dividends of more than £200m in each of the seven years which followed. It carved Thames up into a complex corporate structure, layering debt across multiple tiers of companies. This so-called whole-business securitisation even involved setting up subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands. The consortium would ultimately take out £2.8bn during Macquarie’s ownership, representing two-fifths of the total £7bn in dividends that Thames Water has paid between 1990 and 2022, according to Guardian analysis. Macquarie said £1.1bn was paid out to all shareholders, with its funds receiving £508m. Its current owners – which include Canadian pension fund Omers, the UK universities pension fund and a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund – have not taken a dividend since 2017, although “internal” dividends have been paid to service debts higher up its complex corporate structure. Thames Water, which was privatised with zero debt, saw its debts swell from £3.4bn in 2006 to £10.8bn in 2017, when Macquarie sold its final stake. The pension position went from a £26.1m surplus in 2008 to a £260m deficit in 2015. “They left Thames in a crumbling state,” says Roney. From 2004 to 2019, there were “grotesque excesses” of debt amassed at water companies, including Thames, while dividends grew fatter, a senior water industry source said. “It was asset stripping, pure and simple.” A Macquarie spokesperson said: “Debt increased in line with the company’s asset base, which doubled due to the record £11bn of investment delivered over the period.” The highest profile Macquarie executive linked to Thames is Martin Stanley, its former head of asset management, whose division oversaw Thames Water transactions. He earned £10m in 2021, the year he stepped down from the role. Irked by “misconceptions” about utility investors, another Macquarie executive, Martin Bradley, the head of asset management, who oversaw the Thames transactions, wrote to the Financial Times earlier this year arguing that the consortium had kept bills affordable and invested £11bn in network upgrades. The company has even taken the unusual step of addressing media “mischaracterisations” online. The Macquarie spokesperson said: “We have had no influence over the decisions taken at Thames Water in the seven years since our managed funds sold their final equity stake. During the 11 years in which our funds were shareholders in Thames Water, we oversaw the largest investment programme in the company’s history and the highest rate of investment per customer in the industry.” Concerns about underinvestment in the water industry amid the broader challenges of the climate crisis and population growth led to a National Infrastructure Commission report in 2018 which underlined the need for greater drought resilience and leakage reduction. It is still issuing such warnings, saying in 2023 that “a lot more still needs to be done”. In the aftermath of that report, long-mooted plans for reservoirs finally advanced, including a reservoir to the south-west of Abingdon in Oxfordshire – although it still remains the centre of an intense local tussle. By the time Macquarie cashed in its stake, work had begun on the much-debated Thames supersewer, a separate project that sits outside Thames Water’s ownership but which will ultimately be paid for by Thames customers. It was hard to find a corner of British infrastructure free from the bank’s reach. From airports such as Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton to the gas pipe network manager Cadent, Macquarie was now deeply embedded in the UK’s critical national infrastructure. Its link to Cadent would prove handy – insiders say Sir Adrian Montague’s position as Cadent’s chair, and experience dealing with Macquarie, contributed to his appointment as chair of Thames in July last year, parachuted in to handle its turnaround. But along with those assets, Macquarie has acquired a mixed reputation among financial services professionals. Three current lenders to Thames criticised its approach during its time as a major shareholder at the company, saying its behaviour had reflected poorly on the rest of the investment community. Outrage grows In March 2017, Britain’s biggest water company was hit with a huge fine – a precursor of what was to follow. It was just eight days after Macquarie had sold its final stake in Thames to investment managers controlled by Omers and the Kuwait Investment Authority. The Environment Agency’s prosecution led to a record £20.3m penalty, imposed after the emergence of huge leaks of untreated sewage into the Thames and its tributaries which had led to serious impacts on residents, farmers and wildlife, killing birds and fish. The incidents, in 2013 and 2014, took place at sewage treatment works at Aylesbury, Didcot, Henley and Little Marlow, and a large sewage pumping station at Littlemore. “This is a shocking and disgraceful state of affairs,” said Judge Francis Sheridan, delivering the sentence at Aylesbury crown court. “One has to get the message across to the shareholders that the environment is to be treasured and protected, and not poisoned.” In the four years after Macquarie’s exit, Thames was fined £32.4m for 11 water pollution cases, including £4m for discharging an estimated half a million litres of raw sewage into the Seacourt and Hinksey streams in Oxford. In 2023, it was fined £3.3m and called “reckless” over a 2017 incident which saw millions of litres of raw sewage enter two rivers near Gatwick airport. That came on top of £12m of penalties for late or badly managed roadworks in London. The fines were also racking up elsewhere: in 2021, Southern Water was fined a new record of £90m by the Environment Agency for deliberately dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the seas off north Kent and Hampshire over several years. Between 2015 and the summer of 2023, there were 59 prosecutions of water companies in England, with fines handed down by the courts of over £150m. As the fines mounted, so did the public outrage, led by a clutch of vociferous campaigners, notably the former lead singer of the Undertones, Feargal Sharkey. Financial implosion The political winds started to shift, with the then environment secretary, Michael Gove, saying in 2018 that water companies “have not been acting sufficiently in the public interest.” Some had been “playing the system for the benefit of wealthy managers and owners, at the expense of consumers and the environment”, hiding “behind complex financial structures” to avoid scrutiny, he said. Ultimately, it had allowed “failures to persist for far too long”. But the wheels of regulation turn slowly. Ofwat’s concerns were building in 2018, 2019 and 2020, according to insiders who were working on issues such as dividends at the time. In 2017, the Cayman subsidiaries were ordered to be shut down. “By the time Macquarie left, it was abundantly clear that it had ransacked Thames,” a former Ofwat board member told the Guardian. “It might have been after that particular horse had bolted, but Ofwat did take steps to try and stem the tide of dividends.” But it was ultimately only last year that Ofwat gained new powers to stop the payment of dividends to shareholders if they threatened a water company’s financial resilience. And despite the catastrophic financial position it left Thames Water in, Macquarie made a shock return to the English water industry in 2021, taking control of troubled Southern Water and injecting £1bn to save it from possible renationalisation. Its surprise comeback came with a warning from the then chair of Ofwat, Jonson Cox, who told Macquarie that “very profound changes” would be required at Southern. Macquarie said that the regulator had welcomed its investment in struggling Southern Water. Ofwat faced a worsening conundrum. The water monopolies were so heavily indebted that fines risked further undermining their financial resilience. By 2021, mounting outrage over sewage discharges had reached a climax. In November of that year the Environment Agency and Ofwat announced separate, parallel investigations into “potential widespread non-compliance at wastewater treatment works”. Meanwhile, financial problems at Thames were starting to mount. Sarah Bentley, the latest chief executive to promise to turn around the struggling utility, abruptly resigned in June 2023. Before the week was out, it emerged that the government had begun contingency planning for the collapse of Thames, and that Montague would become chair. Accounts differ on the reasons for Bentley’s departure. Industry sources claim she was frustrated with a lack of available funds to turn around Thames more quickly. Montague told MPs she was “feeling the burdens of office were quite considerable”, before hastily apologising. “Sarah Bentley became known as the Scarlet Pimpernel: she was barely seen and only communicated with most staff through emails and bulletins,” recalls Roney. Across English and Welsh water companies, fraught negotiations with Ofwat were under way over how much they could increase bills by for their next five-year spending cycle, due to run from 2025 to 2030. But cash was running out. In July 2023, Thames said it had secured £750m of emergency funding from its shareholders to run to March 2025 and indicated that a further £2.5bn would be needed to cover the five years to 2030. By December, Thames’s complex financial structure was the source of intense examination in Westminster, and had been described by one MP as an “absolute shambles”. The arrival in January of Chris Weston, the former British Gas executive who was most recently boss of power generator Aggreko, was a last roll of the dice by its despairing shareholders. The £2.3m-a-year chief executive was “the bolshiest utilities executive they could find,” sources said. But not everyone is convinced of this: another former colleague says Weston had a reputation for indecision at Centrica, notably when he was running its North American subsidiary Direct Energy. “The joke was Chris was much like the Canadian weather – if you didn’t like his decision, just hang around for half an hour and it will change,” a source recalled. In March, shareholders dropped a bombshell: they pulled the plug on the first £500m tranche of the £750m committed the prior summer, deeming the company “uninvestable”. Ministers showed little sympathy – Gove called Thames “arrogant”. With no more shareholder cash forthcoming amid the standoff with Ofwat, Thames’s parent company, Kemble, told its creditors in April it would be unable to pay a £190m loan due at the end of that month. Inside Whitehall, contingency planning for Thames’s failure gathered pace. A team set up inside government to study the Thames situation in 2023, codenamed Project Timber, drafted a blueprint for turning Thames into a publicly owned arm’s-length body. Lenders would be forced to take heavy losses – with the rest of its £15.6bn of debt added to the public purse. Its dire situation was described as a “critical risk” to the country in briefings to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and chancellor, Rachel Reeves, within days of them taking office. A Thames Water spokesperson said: “We have set out an ambitious business plan for the next five years, and with consistent leadership and priorities, time and resources, and the appropriate regulatory determination, we will turn around this business and make it perform for all our customers, the environment and our wider stakeholders.” The special administration regime for water monopolies, hastily drawn up when the industry was privatised in 1989, was updated. The changes now allow companies to enter administration and ultimately be sold as a going concern after their debts are restructured, rather than liquidating the company. Crucially, the rules have been rewritten to protect taxpayers, ensuring any state support issued would now need to be repaid, before even secured creditors. The company’s fate now rests on how generous Ofwat is with its first ruling on its spending plans on Thursday. Thames has been lobbying desperately to allow it to pay dividends up to Kemble, increase bills by up to 59% and receive smaller fines, but it is unlikely to receive a warm reception. A damaging restructuring for investors and lenders – or even temporary renationalisation – looks inevitable. Ofwat’s final view on bills increases will be released in December. Thames, its investors and – quietly – Macquarie will hope it is still in private hands by that point. The 35-year privatisation experiment looks set to culminate in a crisis that the new Labour government will have to clear up.",

        "title": "BP predicts global oil demand will peak in 2025, bringing to end rising emissions",
        "content": "BP has predicted that the world’s demand for oil will peak next year, bringing an end to rising global carbon emissions by the mid-2020s amid a surge in wind and solar power. The energy company’s influential outlook report has found that oil use will increase by about 2m barrels a day to peak at about 102m in 2025 across both of its forecasts. The first forecast scenario shows the world’s current energy transition trajectory and the other shows the pathway to meeting global net zero targets by 2050. BP predicts in both scenarios that carbon emissions will reach a peak in the middle of the decade amid a rapid expansion of wind and solar power as technology costs continue to fall. However, the report sets out starkly different pathways for the future demand for gas, which has emerged in recent years as key growth area for energy companies including BP. Under the report’s net zero scenario, gas use would peak around the middle of this decade before halving by 2050, compared with 2022 levels. But the current trajectory suggests gas demand will continue to grow throughout the forecast, expanding by about a fifth by 2050. In the scenarios, demand for liquefied natural gas, which is cooled to be transported on ships, climbs by 40% and 30% above 2022 levels respectively. The report also suggests higher-than-expected oil consumption in the 2030s compared with BP’s previous forecasts, which would pose a serious threat to the world’s climate targets. The oil company said its forecasts for the current global trajectory, which included climate policies already in place, showed the world would breach the carbon budgets keeping global temperatures from rising above 2C above preindustrial levels. Under the current trajectory oil demand is expected to fall to 97.8m barrels a day in 2035, which is 5% higher than last year’s BP forecasts. The net zero model predicts demand will remain at 80.2m barrels in 2035, up 10% on last year’s outlook. BP said oil would continue to “play a significant role in the global energy system for the next 10-15 years”. The company attracted anger from environmental campaigners after watering down a pledge to cut oil and gas production by 40% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels, to a 25% decline after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ignited a surge in global energy market prices. The outlook’s findings are likely to stoke fears that the global shift away from fossil fuels towards clean power may be slowing, in part due to rising energy demand in developing economies. Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist, said the world was in an “energy addition phase” during which the consumption of both low-carbon energy such as renewables and fossil fuels was increasing. In order to keep a cap on rising emissions, low-carbon sources would need to roll out at a pace that matched the increase in global energy demand, Spencer added. BP’s outlook predicts wind and solar power capacity will increase eightfold by 2050 under the world’s current climate policies and by a factor of 14 under its net zero scenario, compared with 2022 levels. Expansion in renewable energy projects is expected to be concentrated in China and developed economies over the next decade, accounting for about 30% to 45% of the increase in new capacity across BP’s two scenarios. The rapid expansion in wind and solar power will enable further declines in technology and energy costs that will in turn support more renewable projects, the company said.",

        "content": "What is the new government’s policy on Thames Water? We’ll get a firmer guide – maybe – after regulator Ofwat gives its verdict on all the English and Welsh water companies’ business plans on Thursday. In the meantime, all we have to go on is this pre-election comment from Jonathan Reynolds, now the business secretary: “I wouldn’t want to see a nationalisation. I think there should be a solution that falls short of that.” That statement raises more questions than it answers, unfortunately. Which type of nationalisation would Labour not wish to see? A full-fat, permanent return to public ownership? Or also the temporary “special administration” variety in which Thames’s balance sheet would be straightened out before a return to the private sector? If Reynolds merely meant that permanent nationalisation is a bad idea, many of us would agree. The state’s last grand adventure into building infrastructure, which is what water companies do, was the financial catastrophe called HS2. It is too easy to imagine a repeat in which over-worked departmental officials are given the runaround by sharp private sector contractors who would inevitably do much of the actual work at Thames. Customers might end up no better off. But there is a problem if the Labour government is also signalling that it is reluctant to press the “special admin” button. The threat of special administration is surely essential in the current unstable position. It is one way to impose on Thames the solution that has always looked the simplest way out of the financial mess – a debt-for-equity swap in which shareholders are wiped out while bondholders, owed £15.2bn collectively, take a hefty haircut. Thames’s current shareholders, as it happens, have already given up. They have written down the value of their stakes and declared the company to be “uninvestable”. But that still leaves the bondholders, who are hoping to escape intact if Ofwat is sufficiently generous with its increases in bills. The company’s business plan involves a 44% rise over the next five years, which equates to 59% after inflation, to fund the bulk of a £19.8bn investment programme. On that basis, Thames’s management thinks it has a chance of raising £3.25bn in fresh equity from new shareholders while also avoiding losses for lenders. Come on, though, a hike of 59% is extreme. Everybody knows bills have to rise meaningfully, but 59% would smell suspiciously like a case of billpayers bailing out bondholders by stealth. The cleaner outcome would be a debt write-down to bring the leverage ratio, currently 80%, to the 55%-60% level that regulators regard as financially resilient. If Thames was towing, say, £10bn of borrowings rather than £15bn, the balance sheet would be transformed and the company would look a far more investable proposition. It would be a credible re-set moment. Thames would have financial breathing space while its new chief executive attempts the trickier task of improving the operational performance. We’ll see where Ofwat lands on bills, but Thursday’s draft determination is just the start of the horse-trading and political lobbying before the final decision in December. It is why ministers should be careful about what they mean when talking about preferred outcomes. Do not rule out special administration: it may yet be needed to impose a debt-for-equity swap that would probably have happened already if Thames were listed on the stock market. If Reynolds and co are scared of upsetting bondholders because the government is relying on some of the same source of capital to finance new energy infrastructure, they need to get over it. Financial markets are quite capable of viewing Thames for what it is – a special case of extreme financial engineering. On the right terms, they’ll still show up for the windfarms and gigafactories. Worry instead about the fury of Thames customers if they are bounced into a stitch-up for the benefit of bondholders.",

        "title": "Hopes of  interest rate cut dashed by Bank of England economist",
        "content": "Households’ hopes of a cut in interest rates have received a setback after the chief economist of the Bank of England warned that key measures of inflation remained “uncomfortably high”. Huw Pill, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee (MPC), strongly hinted he would vote to keep official borrowing costs at 5.25% when he said wage growth and inflation in the services sector were proving persistent. “I think it’s still an open question on whether the timing for a rate cut is now,” Pill said in an unscripted conclusion of a speech to the Asia House thinktank in London. Pill’s comments had an immediate impact in the financial markets, which had been betting 60-40 in favour of a rate cut when the MPC meets early next month but now see only a 50-50 chance of a move. Pill was among the majority when the MPC voted 7-2 at its last meeting in late June to keep borrowing costs at 5.25%, but is seen by the market as less hardline than some of his colleagues and a potential swing voter. Jonathan Haskell, another member of the MPC, said earlier this week that he favoured keeping rates unchanged. Interest rates were raised at 14 successive meetings of the MPC between December 2021 and August 2023, taking them from 0.1% to their current level. Pill said not too much should be read into headline inflation – as measured by the consumer prices index – falling back to the government’s 2% target. Instead, the MPC was focused on three measures of inflation persistence: labour market tightness, pay growth and services price inflation. “On the basis of recent out turns, at the margin recent developments in these indicators have hinted towards some upside risk to my assessment of inflation persistence,” he said. Pill added that there was a risk that inflation would return above the Bank’s 2% target as a strong labour market, resilient wage growth, and prices in the service sector offset cooling energy prices, which have helped to cut the headline rate in recent months. “There is a threat to go higher through the second half of this year, [but] we’re not talking about dramatic changes.” The Bank’s chief economist said there was a danger that focusing too much on the return of inflation to the 2% target in May could lead to “complacency, maybe taking your eye off the ball”. He said the Bank would be “resolute” in focusing on hitting the inflation target. “Not just today but through time.” Asked whether this suggested the Bank would take a cautious approach to setting interest rates, he said: “I wouldn’t back away too much from that.” Despite his cautious approach, Pill said it was still a matter of when, not if, rates would be cut.",

        "content": "JPMorgan Chase, the world’s biggest investor in fossil fuels, may have misled investors and the public by backtracking on its already weak climate and environmental commitments, six US senators have warned in a letter to the CEO Jamie Dimon. Although a climate-disrupted world demands stronger action by the financial sector to reduce emissions and protect nature, the Wall Street firm is heading in the opposite direction, say the upper chamber legislators, who include Senate banking committee member Elizabeth Warren. They have demanded clarification about the intentions of the world’s biggest bank. Senator Warren said: “If JPMorgan Chase has misled investors and the public, both Congress and regulators have a range of tools to respond as necessary.” They have given the bank until 24 July to reply. The letter, shared exclusively with the Guardian, reflects growing concern that JPMorgan Chase is watering down public commitments it has made over decades. Campaigners say this poses a structural risk because short-term interests are taking precedence over long-term climate – and financial – stability. JPMorgan Chase, which has $4tn in assets, has been criticised for making profits while the world burns. The letter notes that the company has financed over $430bn in fossil fuel projects since 2016, more than any other institution on the planet. Concerns rose earlier this year when Dimon announced a shift in policy that suggested JPMorgan Chase would dilute its environmental goals. In an 8 April letter to shareholders, he indicated the company was “going to use the word ‘commitment’ much more reservedly in the future, clearly differentiating between aspirations we are actively striving toward and binding commitments”. The senators’ letter said the company reversed its previous promise by pulling out of the Climate Action 100+ and the Equator Principles, which serve as a common baseline for institutions to manage environmental and social risks when financing projects. Instead of being proactive about the climate threat, Dimon said JPMorgan Chase would wait for “proper government action . . . [that is] not there yet”. The firm also swapped its clear Paris Climate Agreement goal to reduce its emissions intensity with a blurry new “Energy Mix” target that makes it impossible, the senators say, for an investor to know if JPMorgan Chase is doing anything at all to reduce its oil and gas financing because it now dumps this into a blender with clean energy. “Your full set of comments indicated JPMorgan was completely abdicating any role in addressing climate change,” says the letter, which is also signed by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Peter Welch, Bernie Sanders, Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley. “This raises questions about the impact of these policy changes moving forward, and about whether you were misleading investors and the public when you made these commitments.” Concerns are also growing that other major US banks are sliding away from their promises of climate and biodiversity action. Citi, Bank of America and Wells Fargo also quit the Equator Principles earlier this year, a move that climate groups condemned as “shocking” and “cowardly”. At a time of record temperatures and deadly storms, this has led to a public backlash. On the streets, the climate finance movement has staged protests outside several Wall Street institutions, including Citi, Bank of America and major insurers. Pressure also came in the annual banking on climate chaos report, produced by a coalition of environmental groups, which details the investments of JPMorgan Chase and other majors bankers in climate destabilising projects. BlackRock also limited its involvement. Last month, the financial watchdog NGO Stand.earth highlighted JPMorgan Chase among five of the world’s biggest banks, whose environmental and social guidelines fail to cover more than 70% of the Amazon rainforest. The report found JPMorgan Chase made $2.4bn in capital available to companies that operate oil and gas projects in the Amazon and its biodiversity protections applied to only Unesco world heritage sites that cover just 2% of the region. By contrast, the study commended the British bank HSBC, which was once a major funder of destructive projects in the region but has not provided any financing since it adopted a 100% Amazon exclusion policy in December 2022. Ernesto Archila of the Public Citizen’s Climate Program, said banks needed to be brought into line. “They made commitments when it was politically expedient and now they are walking them back. It is really important for senators to call attention to this issue,” he said. “This underlines the need for regulators to take urgent action. Banks should be compelled to take a serious look at their financed emissions, and make effective and transparent plans to address the financial risks associated with climate change. It is clear that a short-term profit motive is driving the behaviour of the banks. It is now up to regulators to step in and prevent those short-term interests from creating structural risks.” JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the record. A representative shared materials showing the company is a major financier of clean energy, as well as fossil fuels. On its website, the bank says it has broken down the elements in its Energy Mix Target to show oil and gas financing. A recent op-ed by a senior executive said banks have a role in supporting the energy transition with capital, but stressed that governments need to take the lead: “To transform the energy mix, boost new industrial activity, and build sustainable infrastructure at speed and scale, governments need to lead by setting necessary enabling regulatory frameworks and policy incentives to transform regional and local economies, reskill global workforces, unblock permitting to develop the backlog of necessary infrastructure, and so on.”",

        "title": "South East Water calls for investor cash to stay afloat; environment secretary to meet water bosses – as it happened",
        "content": "South East Water has said it needs a cash injection from investors to stay in business as it gears up for a major Ofwat ruling on its future spending plans. The struggling water company – which serves 2.3 million people across Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire – said it is “in discussions with lenders and shareholders regarding additional liquidity”. The talks are at an “advanced” stage and bosses “expect” to raise the extra funding, but the company has not struck a deal on the investment. “If it is not possible to raise the additional liquidity, the group and therefore company would not have sufficient liquidity for the going concern period,” it said in a results statement on Wednesday. It added that “the risk that the funding will not be received constitutes a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the group and company to continue as a going concern”. The UK’s new environment secretary, Steve Reed, has summoned the bosses of Britain’s water companies for urgent alks tomorrow, amid signs that Labour will take a tougher approach to the industry than the previous Tory government. Reed will host talks with executives from all 16 water suppliers in England and Wales, including Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and Severn Trent. The meeting comes as Ofwat, the water industry watchdog, is due to publish draft determinations on companies’ spending plans for the next five years tomorrow morning. Our other main stories today: Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Take care – JK The Bank of England’s chief economist Huw Pill said that while UK services inflation remains strong, there are signs that “inflationary pressures have now been contained”. In a speech at Asia House in London, he said: At annual rates still not far from 6%, annual services price inflation and wage growth continue to point to an uncomfortable strength in those underlying inflation dynamics. But the latest data also remains consistent with the view that these inflationary pressures have now been contained, and may be starting to revert towards levels that are more consistent with the achievement of the inflation target. Markets are expecting the central bank to start cutting interest rates in August or September. Here is my full story on today’s housebuilding news from Barratt, Crest Nicholson and Travis Perkins: Drivers will be charged up to £4 at peak times for a one-way trip through either the Blackwall tunnel or the new Silvertown tunnel after the latter opens in 2025, Transport for London has announced. However, TfL is proposing to halve these charges for low-income local residents in east London to use either of the road tunnels under the Thames, as well as exempting buses, black taxis and zero-emission cabs. Standard off-peak journeys will cost £1.50 for car drivers paying automatically, TfL said, as an eight-week consultation over the proposals opened on Wednesday. The Blackwall tunnel has been free to use since opening more than a century ago, but TfL has argued since first developing plans for the new Silvertown crossing back in 2012 that both routes under the Thames should incur a charge. Royal Mail is to stop using its own trains to transport post after almost 200 years. The company has confirmed it will decommission its remaining freight trains by 10 October, with a plan to increase the amount of post it moves by road. The move comes as Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS), is the subject of a £3.6bn takeover bid from Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský. Royal Mail began running trains to transport post in 1830, with the service reaching its peak in the lead up to the second world war when more than 130 trains were used on the network. It now runs just six, which are almost 30 years old and considered at the end of their operational lives. Thames Water has failed to complete more than 100 upgrades to ageing sewage treatment works to meet legal pollution limits, the Guardian can reveal. The schemes costing £1.1bn were supposed to cut pollution into rivers by increasing the capacity at sewage works, adding phosphorus removal to the treatment process, and installing new storm tanks. The upgrades, which were promised in 2018, are being paid for by customers as part of a five-year spending round to 2025 but will not be delivered within that timeframe. Meanwhile, Thames Water awaits a crucial decision on Thursday from the regulator Ofwat on the company’s new five-year business plan. Thames wants to increase customer bills 59% by 2030 to pay for record investment of £19.8bn to tackle sewage pollution, leaks and water shortages after decades in which the company has sweated assets and underinvested. The company is asking the regulator to allow the late projects to be rolled over into the new spending round, known as PR24. Ash Smith, the founder of the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, said customers had already paid for the projects to upgrade ageing sewage treatment works, and were being asked to pay again. “Thames Water failed to deliver around 108 schemes that were funded in the last spending cycle and we question whether that a deliberate act to keep it financially afloat. A proper investigation into this company is long, long overdue.” Smith added: “It has broken our sewerage infrastructure while extracting cash, right under the noses of regulators and the government.” A Wessex Water TV advert about its plans to tackle storm overflows has been banned as misleading because it omitted key information about its record on sewage pollution. The Advertising Standards Authority investigated after receiving a complaint about the ad for the supplier, which provides water to 1.4 million customers and sewerage services to 2.9 million people in the south-west of England. The ad said Wessex was investing £3m a month to tackle storm overflows and featured a voiceover that claimed it was “building more storm tanks to increase storage” and “separating rainwater from sewage”, adding that “a better way, for our waterways, is already under way”. The ASA said it had upheld a complaint that the advert, which aired in February, was misleading because it omitted significant information about Wessex Water’s environmental impact. It said the advert should not appear again in the same form, concluding “that the ad omitted material information and therefore was likely to mislead”. There was a time when privatised British water companies were as unpopular as they are now, writes our financial editor Nils Pratley. During the hot summer of 1995, the managing director of Yorkshire Water, Trevor Newton, achieved notoriety when he urged customers to use less of his company’s product by issuing a motivational message: “I personally have not had a bath or shower for three months.” After a round of jokes about “the filthy rich” – because megabucks pay for water company bosses was also in the headlines in those days – Newton invited the press to watch him washing with a flannel and bowl. It later emerged he had been popping out of Yorkshire for a soak at his parents’ and in-laws’ homes. The serious aspect of the farce was that, just as now, the public was outraged by the mismatch between rewards for investors and the standard of service being provided by a privatised utility. Yorkshire had just paid a £50m dividend to shareholders and yet the city of Bradford was at risk of running dry. A new grid was behind schedule and the company was reduced to transporting water by tanker through the Dales. “Public anger exploded,” recalled Sir Ian Byatt, the first head of the Office of Water Services, or Ofwat, the regulatory body created at privatisation in 1989, in his account of his career. The saga also underlined the rotten state of the water infrastructure, the reason given for privatisation in the first place. The UK was regarded as the “dirty man of Europe” on account of pollution on beaches and in rivers. Spending by the industry on overhauling its pipes and sewage-treatment works had been falling from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s and now the UK had to meet new European Community standards on pollution. South East Water’s parent company, HDF Holdings, is owned by NatWest’s pension fund, an Australian infrastructure investor and a Canadian pension fund. The company is already on regulator Ofwat’s watchlist for financially at-risk companies, alongside Thames Water and other regional monopolies. The company’s financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies’ five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030. That will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December. South East Water has put forward plans that would see spending rise to £1.9bn to maintain and update its infrastructure. However, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 22%. The search for funding comes after South East Water’s owners provided a £150m loan to a unit in the utility group earlier this year. South East Water’s pre-tax loss narrowed to £36m for the year to 31 March, down from £74m the year before. Turnover rose 9% to £281m. It is also still under investigation by Ofwat for an incident in June 2023 when the company failed to deliver water to thousands of customers for more than a week. The consequences could include a hefty fine from the regulator. South East Water said it needs a cash injection from investors to stay afloat, as it gears up for a key ruling from the water regulator on its future spending plans tomorrow. The struggling water firm, which serves 2.3 million people across Kent, Sussex and Surrey, said it is “in discussions with lenders and shareholders regarding additional liquidity”. The talks are at an “advanced” stage and bosses expect to raise the extra funding, but the company has not struck a deal on the investment. If it is not possible to raise the additional liquidity, the group and therefore company would not have sufficient liquidity for the going concern period. It added that “the risk that the funding will not be received constitutes a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the group and company to continue as a going concern”. Tim Martin, the politically outspoken boss of the JD Wetherspoon pub chain, has praised the new Labour chancellor’s economic “pedigree”, as he called for tax changes to help the struggling hospitality sector. Martin regularly publishes economic and political commentary alongside his company’s results and has previously voiced support for Brexit and Boris Johnson. However, today he made overtures to Rachel Reeves, as he blamed the previous government for failing to relieve the tax burden on the struggling hospitality sector. Martin said: The last government failed to implement tax equality between pubs and supermarkets, leading to pub closures and underinvestment. Wetherspoon hopes that the current chancellor, with a Bank of England pedigree, will understand how many beans make five, and rectify this inequality. The head of Water UK has defended asking customers to pay for what he described as “important” investment in the water network. When asked how water companies can justify rising bills on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, David Henderson, chief executive of the trade association for the water industry, said: We have not built a reservoir in 30 years - even though our population has risen by 20% in that time - and that’s because we’ve been blocked by regulators and planning officials around the country. We need to increase our water supply and if we don’t make these investments we won’t get it. Unfortunately the investment will paid for up front by the shareholders of the companies and then slowly recouped over time. The UK’s new environment secretary, Steve Reed, has summoned the bosses of Britain’s water companies for urgent alks tomorrow, amid signs that Labour will take a tougher approach to the industry than the previous Tory government. Reed will host talks with executives from all 16 water suppliers in England and Wales, including Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and Severn Trent. The meeting comes as Ofwat, the water industry watchdog, is due to publish draft determinations on companies’ spending plans for the next five years tomorrow morning. Thames Water is in the most precarious position among the water companies. It said yesterday it intended to tap investors for fresh funds as it would run out of money by next June without a cash injection, raising fears over its potential collapse. The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, Tim Farron, has called for Thames Water to be brought into public ownership. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, the former Lib Dem leader said: Thames Water is a special case. I think they are the most egregious offender, if you like, and the simple answer is Thames Water should be taken back into administration and directly run by the government for the time being. European shares are pushing higher following gains in Asia and on Wall Street, with Japan’s Nikkei hitting a new record level of 41,831, up 0.6%. The FTSE 100 has regained some of the ground lost yesterday, as airlines and precious metals miners gave the market a lift. The FTSE has climbed 31 points, or 0.4%, to 8,171. The German Dax and the French CAC have both gained 0.3% while Italy’s FTSE MiB is 0.4% ahead. In London, IAG, which owns airlines such as British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, is leading gains on the FTSE 100, trading more than 4% higher. EasyJet is another big riser, up 2.2%. They appear to have been boosted by research from TSB showing that Britons are cutting back on DIY and households goods purchases, but are splashing out on one-off treats such as holidays and days out. Stock markets have rallied over the past fortnight on growing expectations of US interest rate cuts. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: Testimony from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell before the US Senate saw him flag a return to normality in the labour market. While he made no commitment on rate cuts, jobs data is one of the most important influences on the Fed’s decision making because tight labour market conditions and rapidly rising wages can lead to inflation becoming entrenched. “Labour may have made a big play of getting Britain building but the industry is not yet responding in kind,” said Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell. Tellingly, Barratt Developments is expecting a further slowdown in completions in the current financial year. Its year-end trading update shows completions have already dropped dramatically from the levels seen in the 2022 and 2023 financial years and it means Barratt will only be building modestly more homes than it did at the height of Covid when restrictions put building work on hold. The long wait for interest rates to be cut is clearly affecting demand as the cheaper mortgages everyone was expecting this year haven’t materialised, at least not to the extent that was initially anticipated. On a brighter note, there are clearly signs that the cost inflation experienced by the sector in recent years is beginning to ease. Notably, the company is expecting to buy more land going forward which suggests that the current financial year could represent a nadir in terms of the volume of homes built. Barratt will hope its proposed merger with Redrow gets the all-clear from the competition authorities – a combination helping to build scale and, both parties will hope, resilience. In other housing news, the building materials merchant Travis Perkins has appointed the former Taylor Wimpey boss Pete Redfern as its new chief executive. Redfern ran Taylor Wimpey, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, for 14 years until 2021 and was involved in the company’s creation –- he was the boss of George Wimpey before it merged with Taylor Woodrow in 2007. He is taking over from Nick Roberts at Travis Perkins, which also appointed a new chair, Geoff Drabble. Drabble also chairs Ferguson, the building materials distribution business listed on the New York and London Stock Exchanges, which mainly operates in North America, and is also chair of the packaging firm DS Smith, and has sat on the board of kitchen supplier Howdens in the past. DS Smith has agreed to a £5.8bn takeover by its bigger US rival International Paper, and Drabble is likely to relinquish his chairmanship when the deal goes through. Housing analyst Stephen Rawlinson said: The appointments will be a bit of a shock as both might have been seen as entering a quieter phase of their careers but awakening the sleeping giant that is Travis Perkins is clearly too great an attraction. We are surprised at the moves at Travis Perkins but can see how Pete and Geoff could be motivated to get stuck into their new roles, as both will remember what Travis was in the past and how it has declined in the last decade, and the platform for renewal it now represents. Redfern will receive an annual salary of £760,000, and will be in line for an annual cash bonus and restricted share plan award at the same level as his predecessor. There are no forfeited awards from previous employment to be bought out. Another UK housebuilder, Crest Nicholson, just said that its board is “minded to recommend unanimously” to its shareholders a sweetened of £720m all-share takeover deal from its bigger rival Bellway, if it tables a firm offer. Crest shares, listed on the FTSE 250, rose 2.8% to 245.2p on the news. The company explained: The boards of Bellway and Crest Nicholson believe that there is compelling strategic and financial rationale for a combination of Bellway and Crest Nicholson. The revised proposal would bring together the strength of each business with complementary brands to reinforce Bellway’s position as a leading UK housebuilder, while enabling Crest Nicholson shareholders to benefit from the scale of the combined business. A month ago, Crest rejected a £650m approach from Bellway. The business has been struggling, racking up losses in the first half of year. It slashed its dividend in its latest profit warning last month as it continued to be hit by volatile mortgage rates and slowing demand in the housing market. Barratt, Britain’s biggest housebuilder, said it expects to build up to 7% fewer homes this year than last, sending its shares down almost 3%. The shares are the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index this morning, trading 2.9% lower. Barratt expects completions to drop by up to 7% to 13,000-13,500 this year, from 14,004 homes in the year to June. That total was down by 18.6% from the previous year when it built 17,206 homes. Even so, it estimates that adjusted profit before tax will be slightly ahead of its previous expectations. Markets had forecast £355m. First-time buyer activity has stabilised and shown some recovery, accounting for 27% of private sales, up from 25% the previous year. Demand among existing homeowners remained resilient, albeit with continuing elevated levels of sales incentives and increased use of part exchange, at 16% of private reservations in the year. Barratt has agreed to buy another housebuilder, Redrow, in a £2.5bn deal, and both sets of shareholders approved it in mid-May. David Thomas, the chief executive, said the business looks forward to working with the new Labour government on tackling the UK’s housing crisis. We welcome the new government’s urgency and focus on housebuilding and reform of the planning system as key to both unlocking economic growth and tackling the chronic undersupply of new homes. We look forward to working with government and wider stakeholders to address supply side constraints and deliver the new homes, of all tenures, the country needs. The vast majority of eye doctors believe increased outsourcing of cataract operations to private clinics in England in recent years has negatively affected their NHS departments, research has found. Almost three-quarters of ophthalmologists surveyed said that outsourcing of cataracts to the private sector had a negative impact on their NHS eye care departments, with 54% flagging a large negative impact and 16% a small one. The survey of 200 eye doctors by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI), shared with the Guardian, came after Wes Streeting, the new health secretary, pledged to divert billions of pounds from hospitals to GPs to “fix the front door to the NHS” and met junior doctors on Tuesday to try to end a long-running pay dispute. Nearly 60% of the ophthalmologists polled said outsourcing had a negative impact on NHS staffing, 62% said the same for staff training, and 46% said it harmed the ability of public eye care departments to treat patients with more complex conditions. Issues raised about staffing included the loss of consultants, nurses and optometrists to the private sector. Oil prices have fallen as the impact from Hurricane Beryl faded and inflation data highlighted weak consumer demand in China, the world’s biggest importer of crude. Brent crude, the global benchmark, dropped by 50 cents, or 0.6%, to $84.15 a barrel while US West Texas Intermediate crude slipped by 0.5% to $80.99 a barrel. There are signs that the Texas energy industry was little affected by Hurricane Beryl after it swept through the region on Monday, easing concerns over oil supply. Suvro Sarkar, DBS Bank’s energy sector team lead, told Reuters: Hurricane Beryl blowing over seems to be the biggest driver for the time being and an opportunity for traders to lock in some profits after a bullish run over the last two weeks. The latest inflation figures from China showed annual consumer price inflation dipped to 0.2% in June from 0.3% in May despite Beijing’s measures to revive consumer demand. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britons are cutting back on DIY and households goods purchases, but are splashing out on one-off treats such as holidays and days out, according to a report from TSB entitled How Britain spends. There was a 9.2% increase in spending with airline and travel companies between January and June compared with a year earlier. People spent more on entertainment such as concerts, theme parks, going to the cinema and theatre (up 5.1%), with spending on amusement parks jumping by 20.2%. Spending in pubs is also up, by 7.2% — driven by spending over Easter and the May Bank holidays rather than during the euro tournament, as spending in pubs fell by 2.5% in June compared to May. As people try to manage their household costs, many are shelving renovations or home improvement projects, with overall spending on DIY, electrical and furniture falling by 15.5%. They also spent less on new clothes, down 4%. As food price growth has slowed, supermarket spending has risen by 3.4%. The report, a six-monthly analysis of TSB debit card transactions, shows consumers spent £9.5bn in the first half of the year. While this is up 1.7% compared to the same period in 2023, it is lower than the rate of inflation of 2%. Delphine Emenyonu, head of loans and credit cards at TSB said: While many household budgets are under pressure, consumers are remaining optimistic – with many prioritising spend on treats such as holidays and entertainment. Consumers are feeling more confident about their finances, and with a potential interest rate cut later in August, we may see increased spending levels in the second half of the year. In China, consumer prices grew for a fifth month in June, but less than expected, while producer price deflation persisted, with domestic demand in slow recovery mode despite Beijing’s support measures. The Chinese government has sought to revive consumer demand following a lacklustre post-Covid recovery but people remain worried about the housing downturn and job insecurity. The consumer price index rose 0.2% in June from a year earlier, compared with a 0.3% rise in May, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Economists had expected an annual rate of 0.4%. Food prices fell by 2.1% year on year despite supply disruptions caused by poor summer weather. Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said The risk of deflation has not faded in China. Domestic demand remains weak. The producer price index fell by 0.8% in June from a year earlier following May’s 1.4% decline. Asian shares remained close to two-year highs hit at the start of the week. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6% to a new record high, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped by 0.1% and the Shanghai market fell by 0.57%. Stocks have rallied on the back of growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates soon, with Fed chair Jerome Powell saying yesterday that the US is “no longer an overheated economy”.

        "content": "Royal Mail is to stop using its own trains to transport post after almost 200 years. The company has confirmed it will decommission its remaining freight trains by 10 October, with a plan to increase the amount of post it moves by road. The move comes as Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS), is the subject of a £3.6bn takeover bid from Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský. Royal Mail began running trains to transport post in 1830, with the service reaching its peak in the lead up to the second world war when more than 130 trains were used on the network. It now runs just six, which are almost 30 years old and considered at the end of their operational lives. A Royal Mail spokesperson said it was becoming difficult to secure parts for maintenance and, after reviewing plans to acquire new trains, it was decided that using other commercial rail services and increasing road deliveries was a better option. They said: “To improve reliability, increase cost effectiveness and remain consistent with our environmental goals, over the coming months we will cease operating our own trains while continuing to use a mix of rail, road and air to transport mail to all corners of the UK.” However, DB Cargo, which operates the services, said the decision represented a U-turn by Royal Mail, which had previously committed to increase its use of rail freight to meet its ambition of being net zero by 2040. In 2022, the Telegraph reported that bosses had drawn up plans to more than treble postal volumes transported by rail and cut the amount of road deliveries. Andrea Rossi, the chief executive of DB Cargo UK, said he was “profoundly disappointed” by the move to axe trains, first reported in the Daily Mail, suggesting it could result in an extra 10,000 HGVs being added to “our already congested roads”. The company estimates that about 3% of its mail is transported by rail and the additional driving workload would create more than 30 full-time driving jobs. It has 5,000 electric vans in operation, while many of its HGVs are operated using biodiesels. The changes come days after Royal Mail confirmed it was halving the number of daily chartered flights transporting post around the UK, to 18, and forms part of a plan by Martin Seidenberg, the chief executive of IDS, to carry out “the biggest network change in 20 years” to revamp Royal Mail’s deliveries. The company has said it will press on with the shake-up despite the ongoing takeover bid by Křetínský’s company, EP Group. The offer promises a number of undertakings and contractual commitments, including maintaining the delivery of first-class post six days a week. The Royal Mail rail service has held an important role in British culture over the decades. It was the subject of the famous 1936 poem Night Mail by WH Auden, and an accompanying documentary, which charted the journey of one of these trains dropping off letters from London Euston to Aberdeen. In 1963, thieves escaped with more than £2.6m, the equivalent of £69m today, after holding up a Royal Mail service travelling from Glasgow to London, in what came to be known as the Great Train Robbery.",

Its shares were the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index on Wednesday, dropping by 2.9%, and later trading 2.2% lower. Barratt expects completed homes to drop by up to 7% to between 13,000 and 13,500 this year, down from 14,004 in the year to 30 June, citing “another year of economic and political uncertainty”. That total was down by 18.6% from the previous year, when it built 17,206 homes.

David Thomas, Barratt’s chief executive, said the business looked forward to working with Keir Starmer’s government on addressing the UK’s housing shortage. “We welcome the new government’s urgency and focus on housebuilding and reform of the planning system as key to both unlocking economic growth and tackling the chronic undersupply of new homes.” The housing market is still recovering from the aftermath of Liz Truss’s unfunded budget in September 2022 that sparked a crisis in the mortgage market. The Bank of England is taking longer than expected to lower interest rates, with financial markets forecasting the first reduction in August or September. Barratt had drastically scaled back land purchases in the last two years but is starting to purchase more land again. This week, the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, unveiled a number of measures to “get Britain building again” and construct 1.5m new homes over the next five years. The government will create a taskforce to accelerate stalled housing sites, beginning with 14,000 homes, and hire 300 planning officers in local authorities. Thomas took part in a call hosted by the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, with 170 business leaders on Tuesday, and Barratt has further meetings lined up with ministers. Barratt said demand from first-time buyers had stabilised and shown some recovery, accounting for 27% of private sales in the past year, up from 25% the previous year. Demand among existing homeowners remained resilient, at 16% of private reservations in the year, although Barratt said it was having to offer sales incentives and part-exchange to prospective buyers. Meanwhile, housebuilders are embarking on a wave of consolidation. Barratt has agreed to buy another housebuilder, Redrow, in a £2.5bn deal, which both sets of shareholders approved in mid-May. Together, they could build 18,000 homes a year. Crest Nicholson, another UK housebuilder, said that its board would be “minded to recommend unanimously” a sweetened £720m all-share takeover deal from its bigger rival Bellway, if it tables a firm offer. Crest shares rose by 2.9% to 245.4p. A month ago, Crest rejected a £650m approach from Bellway. The FTSE 250-listed builder has been struggling, racking up losses in the first half of year. It slashed its dividend in its latest profit warning last month as it continued to be hit by volatile mortgage rates and slowing demand in the housing market. Meanwhile, the building materials merchant Travis Perkins appointed the former Taylor Wimpey boss Pete Redfern as its new chief executive. Redfern ran Taylor Wimpey for 14 years until 2021 and was involved in the company’s creation – he was the boss of George Wimpey before it merged with Taylor Woodrow in 2007. He is taking over from Nick Roberts at Travis Perkins, which also appointed a new chair, Geoff Drabble. Drabble also chairs the building materials distribution firm Ferguson, and the packaging firm DS Smith, which has agreed to a £5.8bn takeover by its bigger US rival International Paper. Redfern will receive an annual salary of £760,000 reflecting his experience – higher than Roberts’ £675,000 salary – and will be in line for annual cash and share bonuses at the same level as his predecessor. There are no forfeited awards from previous employment to be bought out.",

        "title": "Thames Water fails to complete 108 upgrades to ageing sewage works",
        "content": "Thames Water has failed to complete more than 100 upgrades to ageing sewage treatment works to meet legal pollution limits, the Guardian can reveal. The schemes costing £1.1bn were supposed to cut pollution into rivers by increasing the capacity at sewage works, adding phosphorus removal to the treatment process, and installing new storm tanks. The upgrades, which were promised in 2018, are being paid for by customers as part of a five-year spending round to 2025 but will not be delivered within that timeframe. Meanwhile, Thames Water awaits a crucial decision on Thursday from the regulator Ofwat on the company’s new five-year business plan. Thames wants to increase customer bills 59% by 2030 to pay for record investment of £19.8bn to tackle sewage pollution, leaks and water shortages after decades in which the company has sweated assets and underinvested. The company is asking the regulator to allow the late projects to be rolled over into the new spending round, known as PR24. Ash Smith, the founder of the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, said customers had already paid for the projects to upgrade ageing sewage treatment works, and were being asked to pay again. “Thames Water failed to deliver around 108 schemes that were funded in the last spending cycle and we question whether that a deliberate act to keep it financially afloat. A proper investigation into this company is long, long overdue.” Smith added: “It has broken our sewerage infrastructure while extracting cash, right under the noses of regulators and the government.” Industrywide, water companies are seeking to increase customer bills by up to 91% to pay record investment of £96bn. The new environment secretary, Steve Reed, has summoned water company chiefs to a meeting on Thursday after the Ofwat decision on the PR24 business plans. As well as bill increases, Thames wants the regulator to agree to issue it with lower fines for pollution. Thames also wants Ofwat to increase a 3% limit on capital returns in order to attract vital investment as the company struggles to stay afloat with debts of more than £15bn. Thames has said average annual customer bills would be £608 by 2030. Details of the failure to deliver the 108 upgrade projects on sewage treatment works across the network are contained in a deeply buried appendix to the PR24 business plan being considered by Ofwat. The improvements to the treatment works were intended to fulfil a company target to reduce pollution to zero by 2025. But this week, Thames said sewage pollution had increased by 6% in the past year to 350 events, breaching its legal pollution target and mostly caused by delays to the upgrading of its sewage treatment works. The 108 schemes included upgrades to stop sewage pollution into the limestone tributaries which are the headwaters of the River Thames. The survival of Thames Water, which provides drinking water and sewerage services for 15 million customers, is to a large extent dependent on the decision on Thursday by Ofwat. Thames is seeking new investors for fresh funds. The company said it would run out of money by next June without a cash injection, raising fears over its potential collapse. Its chief executive, Chris Weston, this week blamed last year’s increase in pollution on a 40% rise in rainfall in 2023, saying the ageing treatment works could not cope. But under the Climate Change Act 2008, all water companies were legally obliged to take appropriate action to adapt to the future impacts of climate breakdown, and to provide regular updates on their progress. Thames was first ordered to assess the impact of climate change on its longer term resilience in 2011. The company has blamed the failure to deliver the 108 schemes on macroeconomic events including Covid-19 and the rise in inflation. Thames said supply chain problems were a reason for the delays, as well as pressure from the Environment Agency to force the company to create more storm tank capacity. It said: “We have faced financial and delivery-related constraints which means that a number of schemes will be delivered late.” The company said in its annual report this week: “After decades of underinvestment, it will take time to restore asset health to the level we expect and require.”",

        "title": "Wetherspoon’s boss Tim Martin praises economic ‘pedigree’ of Rachel Reeves",
        "content": "Tim Martin, the politically outspoken boss of the JD Wetherspoon pub chain, has praised the new Labour chancellor’s economic “pedigree”, as he called for tax changes to help the struggling hospitality sector. Martin regularly publishes economic and political commentary alongside his company’s results and has previously voiced support for Brexit and Boris Johnson. However, on Wednesday, he made overtures to Rachel Reeves, as he blamed the previous government for failing to relieve the tax burden on the struggling hospitality sector. “The last government failed to implement tax equality between pubs and supermarkets, leading to pub closures and underinvestment,” Martin said. “Wetherspoon hopes that the current chancellor, with a Bank of England pedigree, will understand how many beans make five, and rectify this inequality.” Martin has often lamented the fact that 20% VAT is levied on food sold in pubs but not in supermarkets, which he says unfairly allows thriving shops to subsidise artificially low beer prices, at the expense of the struggling hospitality sector. More than 500 pubs closed in 2023, according to figures from the British Beer and Pub Association, as the industry wrestles with the higher price of energy, rents and labour. While many pubs are still struggling to recover from Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, which Martin heavily criticised for being harsher on pubs in comparison with other sectors, JD Wetherspoon’s 801 venues have consistently outperformed rivals. The company recorded further growth in revenue in the 10 weeks to 7 July, a period that includes most of the Euro 2024 football tournament. Sales were up 5.8% in the period and 7.7% in the year to date, a period in which the company shut 26 underperforming pubs and opened only two new ones. “Sales per pub are approximately 21% higher than pre-pandemic levels, which has helped to compensate for the very substantial increase in costs,” Martin said. He reeled off a list of cost increases since the pre-pandemic 2019 financial year, including a £164m rise in the cost of labour, £28m on energy, £38m on repairs and loan interest costs that are up by £16m. The pub company has sought to boost takings by introducing beer gardens, staff rooms, above-bar glass racks and improved beer dispensing systems. It expects profits to be in line with market expectations, indicating earnings for the year of about £75m. “These numbers don’t just happen by themselves, said Derren Nathan, an analyst at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. “Wetherspoon consistently outperforms its peers and continues to invest in measures to improve serving times and the customer experience. That’s helped it to mitigate an inflationary-led assault on its cost base.” He said an England victory in Wednesday night’s Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands, which would book the team a place in Sunday’s final, could provide a “final flurry” before the end of the financial year. The fellow leisure analyst James Wheatcroft, of Jefferies, said he expected Wetherspoon’s to benefit from customers “trading down”, thanks to its cheaper prices, coupled with good locations and investment in the pubs themselves.",

Better, and Virtual Lifestyles, were declared insolvent and went into voluntary administration on 3 July, two weeks after the company suspended all share trading. The ASX-listed company’s net loss between July and December was $16.7m, with net liabilities of more than $20m. “The Administrators are undertaking an urgent assessment of Booktopia’s financial position, whilst pursuing options for completing a recapitalisation of Booktopia or a sale of its business or its assets,” the administrator said in a circular to customers. “The recapitalisation / sale process will operate within a compressed timeline to minimise business disruption.” The payment of all unsecured claims, including customers, will be dependent on the outcome of that sale or recapitalisation, and realisations from other assets, the administrators added. Previous media reports have named Dymocks, Brisbane-based QBD Books and online retailer Kogan.com as potential buyers. Booktopia posted record profits during the Covid pandemic, and by 2021 had outstripped Amazon in market share of the Australian online book sector. The company re-invested profits in expanding and modernising its warehouse, but the increased cost of living, more online competition and a volatile market brought a post-Covid downturn, according to Booktopia’s chairman, Peter George. Over the past year, the company has shed about 100 jobs, which was expected to save the company more than $6m. The first creditors meeting will be held on 15 July.",

        "title": "Cheap sales, debt and foreign takeovers: how privatisation changed the water industry",
        "content": "There was a time when privatised British water companies were as unpopular as they are now. During the hot summer of 1995, the managing director of Yorkshire Water, Trevor Newton, achieved notoriety when he urged customers to use less of his company’s product by issuing a motivational message: “I personally have not had a bath or shower for three months.” After a round of jokes about “the filthy rich” – because megabucks pay for water company bosses was also in the headlines in those days – Newton invited the press to watch him washing with a flannel and bowl. It later emerged he had been popping out of Yorkshire for a soak at his parents’ and in-laws’ homes. The serious aspect of the farce was that, just as now, the public was outraged by the mismatch between rewards for investors and the standard of service being provided by a privatised utility. Yorkshire had just paid a £50m dividend to shareholders and yet the city of Bradford was at risk of running dry. A new grid was behind schedule and the company was reduced to transporting water by tanker through the Dales. “Public anger exploded,” recalled Sir Ian Byatt, the first head of the Office of Water Services, or Ofwat, the regulatory body created at privatisation in 1989, in his account of his career. The saga also underlined the rotten state of the water infrastructure, the reason given for privatisation in the first place. The UK was regarded as the “dirty man of Europe” on account of pollution on beaches and in rivers. Spending by the industry on overhauling its pipes and sewage-treatment works had been falling from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s and now the UK had to meet new European Community standards on pollution. Margaret Thatcher’s administration, which had already privatised British Telecom and British Gas, decided only private capital and stock market ownership could deliver improvements. “Much emotive nonsense was talked along the lines of, ‘Look, she’s even privatising the rain that falls from the heavens’,” wrote Thatcher in her memoirs. “I used to retort that the rain may come from the Almighty but he did not send the pipes, plumbing and engineering to go with it.” More than three decades later, that same infrastructure requires a big upgrade, with bills to soar when Ofwat outlines the regime for the next five years on Thursday. In the meantime, the 10 English and Welsh water and wastewater companies have paid £78bn in dividends since 1989, and accumulated £60bn in debt. Meanwhile, the biggest of the lot, Thames Water, is at risk of temporary renationalisation. Only three of the 10 are still listed on the stock market. Meanwhile, the industry has become synonymous with mismanagement, corporate greed and pollution, as a string of sewage spills, water leaks and hefty fines led to deep public anger. How did we get here? Sold on the cheap To make privatisation happen in December 1989 – a month after the fall of the Berlin Wall – the government cancelled all the long-term debt owed by the previous water authorities and injected cash into the new companies as a “green dowry”. Such exercises meant the net proceeds to the Treasury, even after selling the companies for a total of £7.6bn, was roughly zero. There was, though, the usual quick win for investors in the stock market listings: shares in the 10 companies rose 20% on average within a month. Half the small investors, encouraged to buy with the slogan “You could be an H2Owner”, took their profits and sold their shares within a year. It was a period of corporate exuberance, lampooned by Harry Enfield’s “Loadsamoney” character. But extra spending did arrive. Investment roughly doubled in the four years after the sellout, from £3bn a year to £6bn. Privatisation fans could also argue that the discipline of a stock market listing, plus a smack from an independent regulator, could force underperformers to improve. After Yorkshire’s shambles in 1995, Ofwat sent in investigators, which led to a management clear-out. By the end of decade, the company was top of the class for performance. Byatt also proposed that Yorkshire should return £40m to customers in the form of price cuts and “after some discussion, it concurred”. But it was immediately obvious that the companies had been sold far too cheaply. Customers’ bills went up by a third in the first five years on the assumption at sale that the companies would need ready access to cash to fund the step-up in investment. Debt levels, it was thought originally, would comprise a maximum of only 35% of the value of the assets – the leverage, or gearing, ratio. The bond market, however, was willing to lend far greater sums to monopoly businesses with captive customers. And, strange as it may now sound, the regulator was keen to see financial gearing rise. The rationale was that savings from lower funding costs would be passed to customers in the form of lower bills. Ofwat’s first five-yearly price review in 1994 slowed the bill rises imagined at privatisation; the second, in 1999, cut bills by an average of 12%. The companies were happy to play the debt game. Some, flush with rising share prices and access to cheap capital, caught the diversification bug in the go-go 1990s. Thames won contracts to run water networks as far away as Indonesia and Chile. Welsh Water lost a packet by buying hotels and country clubs. In 2000, Anglian Water bought a construction company. Takeover games Then there were the takeover games, which began when the government cancelled its golden shares in the 10 companies in 1995. Northumbrian Water was bought by Lyonnaise des Eaux of France. Scottish Power bought Southern Water. Enron of the US – before it crashed in scandalous style in 2001 – bought Wessex Water. Water companies were not allowed to buy one another, but some adopted the fashionable notion of “multi utilities” and bought regional electricity suppliers, which were privatised in 1990. North West Water bought its local supplier to become United Utilities and Welsh Water took over South Wales Electricity, restyling itself as Hyder. None of this activity was slowed by a windfall tax on the privatised utilities, water included, imposed by the incoming Labour government in 1997. Thames, for example, was sold for £922m at privatisation but was valued by the stock market at £2.9bn in July 1997; Severn Trent had risen from £849m to £3bn. By the end of that first decade, the privatised water sector was changed beyond recognition. This newspaper reflected in 1999 on “the mixed effects of water privatisation”. On one hand, too much of the extra profits had been “dissipated in ill-advised diversifications, excess dividends and unearned mega-increases in boardroom pay”. On the other, “a lot of money was invested in improving the infrastructure, so that we now have much improved drinking water”. The deal-making kept coming. Thames was bought in 2000 by the German utility RWE, which paid £4.3bn in cash and assumed £2.5bn of debt. The takeover price of £12.15 a share represented a fivefold increase from the 240p at which all 10 water companies were sold in 1989. Foreign capital continued to chase UK utilities and, in the spirit of times, that was seen as an excellent thing. New Labour was not going to mess with the model. Panic stations What followed was a critical turning point. In the early 2000s, Railtrack, after a series of horrendous fatal accidents on the railways, was forced into receivership and turned into Network Rail. Then British Energy, owner of the bulk of the country’s nuclear plants, had to be bailed out. Both events caused political panic, with the City doing its best to stoke fears that foreign capital would evaporate if owners were seen to be short-changed by government action (the unmerited allegation at Railtrack). In the wings, the water sector was still complaining bitterly that the supposed toughness of Ofwat’s 1999 price review left it with insufficient incentives to invest. The result was two actions that, with hindsight, accelerated financial risk-taking. First, in 2002, Ofwat extended the water companies’ operating licences, which were due to expire in 2014. In their place, 25-year rolling licences were granted. “The longer notice period will enable companies and their investors to plan ahead more securely,” said Philip Fletcher, the late head of Ofwat. That was the hope, but the reform also insulated underperformers from any medium-term threat of being replaced. Then, in 2004, the next five-yearly price review was widely seen as a giveaway to the companies: bills were increased by 20%. Water was seen as even more attractive for investors. At that point, takeover action went into overdrive. New buyers were not other utilities, but financial buyers – investment banks, infrastructure funds, pension funds. Macquarie’s fateful £8bn acquisition of Thames from RWE happened in 2006. So did the takeover of the parent of Anglian by a group of Canadian and Australian pension funds. In 2007, Southern Water fell to a consortium including JP Morgan Asset Management after a tussle with US investment bank Goldman Sachs. Kelda Group, the owner of Yorkshire Water, was bought by a consortium including Citigroup and HSBC. Former regulators have pinpointed this period as one in which the game changed. Byatt wrote in his book A Regulator’s Sign Off: Changing the Taps in Britain: “Private equity infrastructure capital showed the hard face of capitalism, involving leveraged buyouts and short-term policies, namely high borrowing and high dividends, meriting widespread criticism for its lack of transparency and for its financial engineering.” Jonson Cox, who had spells running Yorkshire and Anglian before he was chair of Ofwat from 2012 until 2022, told a House of Lords committee soon after leaving the regulator: “In the 2000s, investment banks began to realise that there was an opportunity to acquire the water company assets and to put significantly more leverage on to those capital structures. I was not at Ofwat at that time. I have disagreed with that approach and I think it is very unfortunate that it happened.” Investment banks created skewed incentives, he argued, and created “the predisposition of thinking of water companies as financial assets”. Financial engineering on steroids Shortly after Macquarie bought it, Thames embarked on a “whole business securitisation” in 2007 – a fundraising whose banal name belied its aggressive approach. A previously staid business of pipes and sewage treatment works was packaged into a complex corporate structure, with eight layers of ownership – including a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, which allowed debt to be layered on debt, like the tiers in a wedding cake. Suddenly, leverage ratios of 50% or 60% went higher than 80% at some companies taken off the stock market. As Thames explained in 2018, this byzantine corporate structure let it borrow more, with the approval of the ratings agencies: “A higher level of leverage is possible at an investment grade credit rating.” Macquarie has defended its use of a whole business securitisation at Thames, saying it was “very common” at the time. “It was a UK water utility product that was invented, advised and constructed by UK banks,” Martin Bradley, the company’s head of infrastructure, told Infrastructure Investor magazine last year. For investors in Macquarie funds that cashed in via a staggered sale of Thames in 2017, he pointed to annual gross returns of 12%-13%, which he argued were in line with regulatory guidance in the 2005-09 period. “There’s nothing in our returns that I’m embarrassed about,” Bradley argued. The Australian bank has also defended its broader stewardship of Thames, saying the company “undertook a record level of investment despite the returns allowed by Ofwat being reduced”. The legacy of the sector’s debt binge in the mid-2000s era lives on, however. Southern Water, which adopted a whole business securitisation in 2003, had to be rescued in 2021 in what now looks like a miniature version of the financial crisis now engulfing Thames. Controversially, the buyer at Southern was Macquarie, which injected £1bn in new equity to recapitalise the business. It was only belatedly that Ofwat woke up to the dangers of overborrowing. Powers to stop the payment of dividends if they would risk the company’s financial resilience were introduced only last year. One core question about the post-privatisation era is whether the gravitational shift from sensibly capitalised public companies on the stock market to heavily leveraged private entities contributed to the sector’s woeful environmental record. Is it, for example, a coincidence that the two most heavily fined companies over the years – Thames and Southern – were also the two with the most aggressive financing structures? Debt, it should be said, has also been used for its original purpose of accelerating investment, complementing the portion funded from bills. Overall, post-privatisation investment has totalled £190bn. But the overuse of financial leverage, with the aim of maximising returns for shareholders, is undeniable. Current Ofwat chief executive, David Black, addressed the point last year when Thames’ financial crisis became acute: “For most companies, debt has been a prudent low-cost source of finance with low interest rates fixed for the long-term,” he said. “However, some companies borrowed too much, most obviously Thames Water. The risk for this – and for correcting this – belongs to the company and its shareholders.” Therein lies one huge tension at the heart of the recent ruling from Ofwat on the companies’ business plans for the next five years. Investment is needed on a massive scale and customers’ bills are going up substantially, whatever happens. But will the regulator really make the worst debt addicts pay for their borrowing binges?",

        "content": "‘If you get a tough job … and you haven’t got a way to make it easy, put a lazy man on it,” a Chrysler executive named Clarence Bleicher once explained to a US Senate committee on productivity. “After 10 days, he will have an easy way to do it.” That quote is often misattributed to Walter Chrysler or Bill Gates. I know this because, fundamentally, I am a lazy man: left to my own devices, I will happily spend 20 minutes on Quote Investigator rather than hoovering the living room or, er, writing a feature about productivity. The problem? I have loads to do. Like many self-styled productivity bros, my weekly schedule includes several gym sessions, a Brazilian jiujitsu habit, practising the piano, writing a newsletter and fostering a couple of side hustles – but I also have a full-time job and a seven-year-old to worry about. While I collect productivity advice like some people collect fridge magnets or Funko Pop! figures, I am ruthless about the tips I actually follow. I don’t journal, meditate or take cold showers; I don’t have 20 productivity apps or an expensive timer. I have a handful of “rules” and heeding them works … pretty well. So, if you are struggling to fit it all in, take some advice from Bleicher, grab some elastic bands (yes, really) and start with the most lazy yet life-changing thing you can do. Write everything down Yes, everything: shopping lists, appointments, jobs that need to be done, ways to entertain a bored child, ideas for that novel you will write if you ever get the chance, all the films and TV shows you want to watch and all the books you want to read. Dave Allen, the author of Getting Things Done, suggests doing this with a complicated system of index cards, but technology has moved on. Put it all in one or two big spreadsheets with separate tabs. It’s incredibly freeing: instead of juggling dozens of ideas in your head, you are outsourcing them to a document. It also cuts down on evenings spent trying to find something to watch across the myriad streaming platforms. But there is one thing I always do in a physical notebook … Ditch the to-do list for a ‘first things’ list The problem with most to-do lists is that they don’t take into account all the stuff you need to do them. “Do tax return” doesn’t work if you haven’t got your receipts in order; “sort out school application” doesn’t work if you don’t know whom to email. With a “first things” list, you split an important task into smaller and smaller chunks until you are left with one “first thing” that you can do immediately (and preferably in less than two minutes). Make a list of those things when you sit down in the morning and it’s easy to start building momentum for the rest of the day. Bonus suggestion: rather than crossing things off your list, put a checkbox next to each item. It takes about 10 seconds longer, but it’s easier to see what you have done – and it’s immensely satisfying. Work out your attention timetable We all have bits of the day when we are fired up and bits when we are not at our best. Maybe you don’t really get going until noon, or your concentration slips after four o’clock. Grab a bit of paper and map out an average working day – start and finish times, breaks, any personal stuff you have to do – and write down when you are most attentive or sluggish. From here, you should be able to calculate the best times for difficult or creative tasks (and work out when you should stick to emails or change the printer cartridge). Obviously, full-time jobs aren’t always respectful of a 3pm lull, but if you have a bit of leeway, try to steer your most tedious tasks towards the time of day when your brain slows down. Use the work-or-nothing rule Raymond Chandler got a lot done. He didn’t start writing detective fiction seriously until the early 1930s, when he was in his 40s, but then wrote seven novels and a handful of screenplays, including two that were nominated for Academy Awards. His advice? “The important thing is that there should be a space of time … when a professional writer doesn’t do anything else but write,” he once said. “He doesn’t have to write, and if he doesn’t feel like it, he shouldn’t try. He can look out of the window or stand on his head or writhe on the floor, but he is not to do any other positive thing, not read, write letters, glance at magazines or write cheques.” Of course, in Chandler’s day, it was easier to avoid distraction; now, it’s likely that whatever device you are writing on can connect you with limitless amounts of stuff to distract you. One option is to work in notebooks or without a connection to the internet. Another is to … Put an elastic band on your phone We have all heard the usual phone advice – put it in a drawer, switch on airplane mode, put a picture of your kid’s face on the lock screen to remind you that you are supposed to be planning for their future instead of doomscrolling – but it’s all a bit too easy to ignore. I can’t ditch my phone entirely – what if the boy’s school wants something urgently? – but anyone who thinks that my smiling child might work as a disincentive hasn’t met me (or him). The only thing that works for me is using a literal barrier in the shape of an elastic band. Wrap one around your screen and it works as a tactile reminder that it’s there for emergencies only. This also helps with the next idea. Set kettle deadlines As a younger man, I used to use boiling the kettle as an excuse to do a handful of press-ups or squats (I worked from home, obviously). Now, as a perma-tired dad, I spend the two or three minutes it takes seeing how quickly I can wipe down the kitchen surfaces or sweep the floor. Another option is to use cups of tea as a brainstorming break. If you are stuck on a work-related problem, the change of venue from desk to kitchen can be enough to get things rolling again. Try ‘progressive’ Pomodoros Productivity coaches swear by the Pomodoro method, named after those tomato-shaped timers popular in high-end kitchens. The idea is that you work for a solid 25 minutes, take a break for five, then come back reinvigorated for the next burst of work. The problem? Sometimes, 25 minutes feels like too much – or you are in the zone and don’t want to stop. An idea I have borrowed from the YouTube creator Mike Rapadas is matching your blocks of work to how focused you feel. Start with a five-minute burst, then carry on if you still feel focused, or take a very short break if you don’t. As you get into the flow, you can make your work blocks longer, until you are cranking out half an hour of intense productivity at a time. Use If &gt; Then thinking This one is about programming your brain to behave better. The idea is that you set up cues that prompt your planned behaviour, rather than making decisions as you go. If you don’t make it to the gym after work, for instance, then do 50 press-ups and 100 squats at home. This saves you from making difficult decisions when you are already tired, stressed or hungry – and hopefully ensures you make better ones. Say ‘I get to’, not ‘I have to’ This is another way to change your thinking: rather than insisting that you go to the gym, practice the clarinet or call your mum, remind yourself that you get to do those things. After all, if you have the time and bandwidth to do those things, it’s often a privilege. Call your mum! Cut out ‘zero days’ I saw this posted by a commenter on Reddit about a decade ago and now people are building their lives around it. The basic concept is that a “zero day” is one where you don’t do anything towards whatever project you are working on, while a “non-zero day” is one where you do, well, something: write one line, practice one scale, do one press-up. The point is to keep the momentum, build the habit and get where you are going. I keep track of non-zero days across everything I am juggling on one bit of paper – a tick for each thing – and try to keep the streak alive across all of them. Start it now, fix it later This is the most important concept I have come across for getting things done. If you have done everything above and you still don’t know where to start on a project, the most important thing is to start and tweak as you go. Go to the gym today and worry about how well it worked your abs this evening. Get a first draft of something done now and fiddle with it tomorrow. Start the thing you want to do and work out the rest in future. • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "title": "Four-day week campaign to launch UK pilot looking at flexible working",
        "content": "Campaigners for a four-day working week are preparing a new pilot project on flexible working in the hope that the Labour government will be more receptive to changes in how people work. The pilot project has opened to companies to sign up for a November start, with findings to be presented to the government in the summer of 2025. The campaign for a four-day working week – crucially with no loss of pay – has been gaining momentum in recent years, particularly after the Covid pandemic lockdowns changed expectations around where and when people work. A total of 61 companies took part in the first UK pilot in 2022. Of those, 54 had maintained it a year and a half later. Other projects have run in Germany, Portugal, Spain and Iceland. The latest trial will also look at other flexible working policies, including a shorter working week, flexible start and finish times, a nine-day fortnight or compressed hours, when people work the same number of hours but over fewer days. The new pilot will be run by the UK’s 4 Day Week Campaign and flexible working consultancy Timewise, with training starting in September. Academics at the University of Cambridge, Boston College and the Autonomy Institute will offer research support. The Conservative UK government was actively hostile to the idea of a four-day week. When South Cambridgeshire district council trialled the change, then local government minister Lee Rowley wrote to the Liberal Democrat-controlled leader asking the council to “end your experiment immediately”. Michael Gove’s levelling up department in December said it would look at using “financial levers” to force councils to fall into line. Joe Ryle, director of the 4 Day Week Campaign, said he hoped that a Labour government will be more receptive to shifting working practices. “With a new Labour government, change is in the air and we hope to see employers embracing this change by signing up to our pilot,” he said. Unlike in 2019, Labour under Keir Starmer did not include a four-day week in its manifesto for last week’s general election. Yet the policy counts as supporters some of the most powerful members of the new cabinet, as well as from the influential Unison union. The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, last year urged businesses to look at the results of the first UK pilot. The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, repeatedly featured the four-day week on a podcast and a book. The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, suggested in an interview last year that Labour would consider the evidence, and that she supported flexible working. And the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, is understood to have met advocates of the policy and expressed interest in the idea. Bron Afon Community Housing, a Welsh social landlord with about 400 staff, is one of the first businesses to sign up to the new pilot, while committing to retaining offices and not dropping standards. Unji Mathur, an executive director at the company, said: “We are impressed by the impact a shorter working week has had on organisations’ performance, wellbeing and retention. “We see this as an opportunity for everyone working at Bron Afon to improve our services to customers by unleashing innovation, working smarter and improving our work-life balance.” A six-day week was the norm in Victorian times, but the rise of trade unions and huge leaps in productivity allowed for the two-day weekend to become the norm. Advocates of the four-day week say it can further improve productivity and staff retention and reduce worker absences. The South Cambridgeshire trial found that fewer refuse collectors quit their jobs, planning decisions were faster, and calls were answered more quickly. Out of 24 areas of council work analysed by academics at the universities of Cambridge and Salford, 11 areas improved their performance, 11 had little or no change, while two areas worsened: rent collection and the speed of reletting empty council houses. Ryle said: “As hundreds of British companies and one local council have already shown, a four-day week with no loss of pay can be a win-win for workers and employers. “The nine to five, five-day working week was invented 100 years ago and is no longer fit for purpose. We are long overdue an update.” Claire Campbell, chief executive of Timewise, said it wanted to see more “site-based, shift-based workers sign up because this is where innovation is needed most”. She added that she hoped the change “will benefit worker health and retention”.",

        "title": "Wessex Water’s TV ad banned for omitting sewage record",
        "content": "A Wessex Water TV advert about its plans to tackle storm overflows has been banned as misleading because it omitted key information about its record on sewage pollution. The Advertising Standards Authority investigated after receiving a complaint about the ad for the supplier, which provides water to 1.4 million customers and sewerage services to 2.9 million people in the south-west of England. The ad said Wessex was investing £3m a month to tackle storm overflows and featured a voiceover that claimed it was “building more storm tanks to increase storage” and “separating rainwater from sewage”, adding that “a better way, for our waterways, is already under way”. The ASA said it had upheld a complaint that the advert, which aired in February, was misleading because it omitted significant information about Wessex Water’s environmental impact. It said the advert should not appear again in the same form, concluding “that the ad omitted material information and therefore was likely to mislead”. Wessex Water has been criticised for its record on sewage discharges by the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, who has called for tighter regulation on water companies. In May 2023, Wessex was fined £280,000 by a Swindon court for supplying water unfit for human consumption for a three-week period in 2021. Storm overflows are supposed to be used by water companies only in extreme weather but for many years they have been used routinely, discharging raw sewage even on dry days in some cases. Wessex Water argued to the ASA that its advert contained no broad claims about environmental performance but was about the issue of storm overflows. It claimed that the ad took a balanced and transparent approach by addressing the shortcomings of outdated systems, particularly storm overflows and sewers, while providing an honest account of their forward progress plan. However, the ASA concluded that although Wessex’s plan would probably result in environmental improvements, its storm overflow problems had caused harm to the environment and “we considered that was significant information which should have been made clear in the ads”. It said: “In this case, we considered that this ad gave people the impression that Wessex Water was taking steps to reduce environmental damage caused by pollution incidents associated with storm overflow.” Wessex Water said: “We are disappointed with the ASA’s ruling based on one single complaint it received about our advert seen by hundreds of thousands of people … We acknowledge that past environmental performance has fallen below our expectations and we have taken steps to address this.” The ASA last year upheld complaints about other water companies and ruled against two ads by Anglian Water Services after they omitted information about the company’s history of releasing sewage into the environment. It also upheld complaints against Severn Trent Water on the same issue. Separately on Wednesday, the ASA also ruled against Luton Rising, the owners of London Luton airport, over a magazine advert and poster on the London Underground that said: “If we miss our environmental limits, our expansion will be stopped in its tracks.” The campaign groups Adfree Cities and the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport were among those who complained that the adverts were misleading because they omitted significant information about emissions from flights. Luton Rising had argued that the purpose of the adverts was to show people that mitigating environmental impacts were central to the airport’s expansion plans. Luton Rising said: “The ASA accepted that the specific carbon emissions covered by GCG [Green Controlled Growth proposals] were set out on the Luton Rising website, to which viewers of the advertisement were pointed. They felt that this distinction should have been made clearer in the advertisement itself, which we will do in any future advertisements.” • This article was amended on 10 July 2024.

        "title": "UK sugar tax explained: what is it and has it worked?",
        "content": "The sugar tax, also known as the UK soft drinks industry levy, was announced in March 2016 and came into effect in April 2018. New research has shown that the levy has led to a significant drop in the amount of sugar in people’s diets across the UK, with the amount of sugar consumed by children and adults from soft drinks decreased significantly, by around a half in children, and by a third in adults, after the sugar tax was announced. Here is a Q&amp;A of the key features of the legislation. What is the sugar tax? The soft drinks industry levy, known as the ‘sugar tax’, is a levy applied to soft drinks which are produced in the UK or imported into the country. It was introduced as part of the UK’s anti-obesity policy and was one of the flagship policies of the 2016 childhood obesity strategy. The tax was targeted at drinks manufacturers in order to incentivise them to reduce the sugar content of their products. According to the levy, the manufacturers of soft drinks will need to pay: 24p a litre of drink if it contains 8 grams of sugar per 100 millilitres or more 18p a litre of drink if it contains between 5 – 8 grams of sugar per 100 millilitres When was it introduced? It was first announced in the then chancellor George Osborne’s budget in March 2016, which was central to the then budget. Osborne said the money raised from the levy would be used to fund primary school sport across England. Commenting on the policy, Osborne said: “I am not prepared to look back at my time here in this parliament doing this job and say to my children’s generation, ‘I’m sorry, we knew there was a problem with sugary drinks, we knew it caused disease, but we ducked the difficult decisions and we did nothing.” At the time, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the levy could result in a “pretty substantial price rise”, such as 80% on a two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola. The levy came into effect just over two years after it was first announced in the budget, in April 2018. What doesn’t the ‘sugar tax’ include and why? The levy applies to drinks with sugar added during their production, drinks with at least 5g of sugar per 100ml in their ready to drink or diluted form and drinks with an alcohol content of 1.2% alcohol by volume or less. The beverages that are excluded includes drinks that are at least 75% milk, milk alternatives such as almond milk, soya milk, alcohol-free beer and wine, fruit or vegetable juices, liquid drink flavouring that’s added to food or drinks like coffee or cocktails, infant formula and powdered drinks. As the levy only applies to soft drinks, foods which are high in sugar such as biscuits and cakes are not currently included in the levy. Has it been effective? Before the levy even came into effect, over half of manufacturers reformulated their drinks in order to avoid the charge. Since its introduction in 2018, several studies have shown its effectiveness in leading to a reduction in the sugar intake of adults and children in the UK. In the first year since its introduction, Public Health England said that there was a 28.8% reduction in the total sugar content per 100ml between 2015 and 2018 for the drinks which the levy would apply to. Research from last year found that the levy may have prevented more than 5,000 cases of obesity every year among girls in their final year of primary school since it was introduced, while another study found that fewer children in England have needed to have rotten teeth extracted at the dentist since the levy was introduced.",

        "title": "Coffee prices will rise even higher, says Giuseppe Lavazza",
        "content": "The price of coffee is set to remain “very high” and is unlikely to drop until the middle of next year amid intense pressure on supply chains, the Italian coffee company Lavazza has said. “We have never seen such a spike in price as the trend right now,” said Giuseppe Lavazza, who chairs the company. He admitted that he had been wrong to predict last year that prices would begin to fall this year. On Monday, prices reached $4,300 (£3,356) a tonne. “The coffee supply chain is dramatically under pressure,” he said in comments reported by the Financial Times. “Coffee prices are not going down … [they’re] going to stay very high.” Worsening harvest conditions in its major production areas of Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia, and shipping disruption caused by the Middle East conflict have exacerbated inflationary pressures, helping prices reach 15-year highs, he said. For UK consumers, this has meant the price of a 1kg bag of beans rising by 15% in a year, and Giuseppe Lavazza said this could increase by 20% to 25% over the coming year. A flat white at the company’s cafe off Regent Street in central London now costs £3.50 to take away or £5.50 to drink in, reflecting current costs. “We have faced very, very strong headwinds. I don’t see any reason why coffee prices will go down,” Lavazza said. However, this has not dented the “strong trend” of UK consumers turning to beans to make fresh coffee at home, which began when the pandemic closed cafes but has showed no sign of slowing. In 2023, the company recorded net profits of €68m, down from€95m in 2022. Lavazza said: “People love it so much. And we think there’s an environmental element too, of people wanting to move away from using pods.” The UK retail coffee market is worth £1.3bn, growing by 3.9% year on year, according to Nielsen figures, driven by price inflation of 3.8%. Lavazza said sales volumes were up 2.9% in 2023 compared with the year before, or the equivalent of 32m more cups of Lavazza coffee on two years ago. Coffee remains a staple for Britons, who drink 95m cups every day.",

        "title": "Rachel Reeves launches £7.3bn national wealth fund",
        "content": "The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is launching a £7.3bn national wealth fund, as part of a drive by the newly elected Labour government to attract billions of pounds of private sector cash for big infrastructure projects across the UK. The NWF, which Reeves said would be established “in less than a week”, is designed to help projects such as ports, gigafactories, hydrogen and steel projects to attract a mix of investment, aiming for roughly £3 of private funds for every £1 of taxpayer cash. Reeves said the fund would essentially operate as a “concierge service for investors and businesses that want to invest in Britain, so they know where to go”. The investments will then be managed by the existing UK Infrastructure Bank, headed by the former HSBC chief executive John Flint, with support from a revamped British Business Bank, best known for running the Covid business loan schemes. Reeves made the announcement at No 11 Downing Street on Tuesday, after meeting City bosses who made up the specialised taskforce spearheading the project. Participants included Aviva’s chief executive, Amanda Blanc; NatWest’s chief executive, Paul Thwaite; the Barclays chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan; and the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Labour has been crafting the NWF for months, having appointed the taskforce in March to start thrashing out exactly how it would deliver what became a core manifesto pledge for the party in the run-up to last week’s election. The chancellor insisted there would be a clear distinction between the NWF and GB Energy, another publicly owned company proposed by Labour. While GB Energy will focus on the “production of clean, low carbon energy”, investment made via the NWF will seek to deploy £1.8bn to ports, £1.5bn for gigafactories including for electric vehicles, £2.5bn to clean steel, £1bn for carbon capture and £500m to green hydrogen. Reeves said the new government was in a prime position to attract investment, amid ongoing political uncertainty in other major western economies. That includes the US, where Donald Trump is due to challenge an under-fire Joe Biden in the November presidential elections, and France, where elections resulted in a hung parliament. “I think for the first time in a long time investors will look at Britain and say it’s a country with a stable government. It’s got a clear plan, but clear mandate in the election. And that’s different from some other countries around the world today,” Reeves told journalists. The NWF will soon be established formally in UK law, making it a “permanent institution at the heart of the country’s long-term growth and prosperity”, the Treasury said. A formal head of the NWF is yet to be appointed, though the government said further details would be set out before an international investment summit to be hosted by the chancellor later this year. The announcement came after Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, hosted a call on Tuesday morning with more than 170 senior leaders from businesses and trade associations around the UK. He set out his four key priorities, according to a departmental source: delivering an industrial strategy, which will be the cornerstone of the government’s growth mission; supporting small businesses, described as the “beating heart” of high streets, communities and economy; resetting trade relations and championing British exports; and making work pay. Reynolds told business leaders that decarbonisation did not mean deindustrialisation. He is aware that a key challenge for businesses is connectivity and the grid, and promised a cross-government focus on tackling this. Sarah Jones’s joint role with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, as minister for industry and decarbonisation, will be part of delivering on this agenda. Business leaders asked about streamlining their engagement with Whitehall, opportunities to increase exports, and the importance of digitalisation. Reynolds promised to be “the most accessible” business secretary, with an email address coming shortly to “tell Jonathan”.",

        "content": "Holding interest rates too high for too long would threaten economic growth and jobs, the US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, warned Congress on Tuesday. “Elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,” said Powell. During a congressional hearing, Powell signaled that while suppressing inflation remains a priority, policymakers at the Fed are now concentrating on when they choose to cut rates. The US is “no longer an overheated economy”, Powell said, adding that its job market has “cooled considerably” from its surge after the early damage inflicted by the pandemic. “We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could stall or even reverse the progress we have seen on inflation,” he told the US Senate banking, housing and urban affairs committee. “At the same time, in light of the progress made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past two years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face. “Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.” The American central bank, which raised interest rates to a two-decade high in a bid to bring down inflation, is now considering its next steps. While price growth has retreated from its highest levels in a generation, it has remained stubbornly higher than the 2% targeted by Fed officials, amid persisting concerns over the cost of living across the US. Fed officials are due to convene for their next rate-setting meeting at the end of July. As of last month, most of the central bank’s policymakers expect to cut rates once or twice this year, according to economic projections released by the Fed. Powell struck a note of optimism on price growth. “After a lack of progress toward our 2% inflation objective in the early part of this year, the most recent monthly readings have shown modest further progress,” he said. Following this modest progress, Powell added, “more good data” would strengthen the Fed’s confidence “that inflation is moving sustainably” to its 2% goal.",

        "content": "The vacuum cleaner and air-filter maker Dyson is cutting about 1,000 jobs in the UK as part of a global restructure, reducing its British workforce by more than a quarter. Staff were told on Tuesday morning about the cuts as part of moves to reduce the business’s 15,000-strong workforce around the world amid a wider cost-cutting drive. Dyson, which is known for its bagless vacuum cleaner as well as hand-dryers and bladeless fans, has 3,500 UK employees, with offices in Wiltshire, Bristol and London. The review that led to the decision began some time before the general election was announced in May.

Labour has been crafting the fund for months, having appointed the taskforce back in March to start thrashing out exactly how it will deliver what became a core manifesto pledge for the party in the run-up to last week’s election. Reeves said the new Labour government was in a prime position to attract investment, amid ongoing political uncertainty other major western economies. That includes the US, where Donald Trump will run in the November presidential elections, and France, where parliamentary elections resulted in a hung parliament. “I think for the first time in a long time, investors will look at Britain and say it’s a country with a stable government. It’s got a clear plan, but clear mandate in the election. And that’s different from some other countries around the world today,” she told journalists. Tulip Siddiq has been appointed Britain’s City minister, responsible for overseeing the financial services sector, Bloomberg News is reporting. Labour won a landslide election victory last week. Siddiq, 41, has led Labour’s efforts to develop policies for the financial services industry, known as “the City,” in the past three years. Her appointment has not been formally announced by the government. In May, she told the Financial Times that Labour would push the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain’s markets regulator, to do more to remove barriers to competitiveness and growth. She would take over from Bim Afolami, a former HSBC banker who held the role under the previous Tory government. Rachel Reeves, the new chancellor, on Monday launched a new “national mission” to drive economic growth, setting out plans to ramp up housebuilding and unblock infrastructure projects. Today, she launched the national wealth fund to unlock billions of pounds in private investment. Jonathan Reynolds, the new business and trade secretary, hosted a call with more than 170 senior leaders from businesses and trade associations around the UK this morning. He set out his four key priorities: delivering an industrial strategy, which will be the cornerstone of the government’s growth mission; supporting small businesses, described as the “beating heart” of our high streets, communities and economy; resetting trade relations and championing British exports; and making work pay, according to a departmental source. Reynolds told business leaders that decarbonisation did not mean de-industrialisation. He is aware that a key challenge for businesses is connectivity and the grid, and promised a cross-government focus on tackling this. Sarah Jones’ joint role with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, as minister for industry and decarbonisation, will be part of delivering on this agenda. Business leaders asked about streamlining their engagement with Whitehall, opportunities to increase exports, and the importance of digitalisation. Reynolds is understood to have pledged to be “the most accessible” business secretary, with an email address coming shortly to “Tell Jonathan”. The Labour government has announced plans to align key institutions under a new National Wealth Fund aimed at boosting growth, with hopes of mobilising billions of pounds in private-sector investment. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, have today instructed officials to immediately begin work to bring together the UK Infrastructure Bank and the British Business Bank under the National Wealth Fund that will invest in the new industries of the future. It comes as Reeves and Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, convene a meeting of the National Wealth Fund Taskforce at No 11 Downing Street to kickstart this work. Chaired by the Green Finance Institute, the taskforce includes former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Barclays chief executive C.S Venkatakrishnan, Aviva chief executive Dame Amanda Blanc and large institutional investors. About £7.3bn of funding will be allocated through the UK Infrastructure Bank so investments can start being made immediately, in addition to existing UKIB funding. Reforms will be made to the British Business Bank, which is overseen by the Department for Business and Trade, to ensure it can mobilise the UK’s deep pools of institutional capital, as the UK’s largest investor in venture capital. “Britain is open for business – and the work of change has begun,” declared Reeves. This new government is getting on with the job of delivering economic growth. I have been clear that there is no time to waste. I have previously committed to establishing a National Wealth Fund. I am now going further by bringing together key institutions. We need to go further and faster if we are to fix the foundations of our economy to rebuild Britain and make every part of our country better off. Sir James Dyson founded his company in 1991, after years of trying to persuade other companies to build a vacuum cleaner to his design. The success of the business made Dyson into one of the wealthiest people in the UK, and one of the most prominent inventor-entrepreneurs. The company has branched out from vacuum cleaners into other household appliances, including fans, hand dryers, heaters, hair straighteners and dryers – and even a pair of headphones that doubled as a portable air purifier. But as his prominence grew, Dyson also became increasingly outspoken about the UK economy. That culminated in his backing for the leave campaign in June 2016 during the referendum on the UK leaving the EU. Dyson claimed that the idea that Brexit would harm the UK’s international trade was “absolute cobblers”. In 2016 he said: We will create more wealth and more jobs by being outside the EU. We will be in control of our destiny. And control, I think, is the most important thing in life and business. Yet before the UK had actually left the EU, Dyson made his own exit: he switched his company’s headquarters from the UK to Singapore in 2019, saying he wanted the company to be closer to its growth markets and factories in east Asia. Jim Rowan, Dyson’s former chief executive (and now Volvo Cars boss), said that the decision had “nothing to do with Brexit” but was about “future-proofing” the business. However, it prompted criticisms for alleged hypocrisy by Dyson. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said it was “staggering hypocrisy” and “a vote of no confidence in the idea of Brexit Britain.” Dyson intends to continue with its research and development of products in the UK. It will also continue to run the Dyson Institute in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, which employs 160 undergraduate on Dyson projects for three days a week. The Dyson Institute will continue to offer a master of engineering course to all new undergraduates starting this September. Dyson has not indicated how many of its global workforce it is considering cutting. It has about 15,000 employees worldwide. The Dyson job cuts were decided as part of a review that was started before the UK general election was called in May, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The UK cuts will be subject to consultation with affected workers. Dyson was founded by Sir James Dyson, a billionaire who was once counted as the UK’s richest person. His fortune was estimated to be worth £20.8bn in May, according to the Sunday Times. Dyson has been outspoken on political issues, including being one of the few prominent businesspeople to come out in favour of Brexit. Chief executive Hanno Kirner said: Decisions which impact close and talented colleagues are always incredibly painful. Those whose roles are at risk of redundancy as a result of the proposals will be supported through the process. Vacuum cleaner manufacturer Dyson has told employees it plans to cut 1,000 jobs in the UK, more than a quarter of the British workforce. Staff were told of the job cuts on Tuesday morning, in news first reported by the Financial Times. Hanno Kirner, Dyson chief executive, said jobs cuts were “always incredibly painful”, in comments to the FT. He said: Dyson operates in increasingly fierce and competitive global markets, in which the pace of innovation and change is only accelerating. We know we always need to be entrepreneurial and agile. We have grown quickly and, like all companies, we review our global structures from time to time to ensure we are prepared for the future. The number of non-doms in the UK rose in 2023, ahead of what is expected to be a crackdown by the new Labour government. There were an estimated 74,000 individuals claiming non-domiciled taxpayer status in the UK on their self assessment tax returns in the tax year ending 2023, up from 68,900 in the tax year ending 2022, HM Revenue and Customs said on Tuesday. Labour has promised to end the non-dom regime to raise billions of pounds for free breakfast clubs in schools and more hospital and dental appointments. That – and the Conservatives’ copying their plans – prompted some wealthy people to claim they would leave if the status is abolished. The non-dom regime was introduced under King George III in 1799 to allow subjects who lived part of the time in far-flung colonies to avoid paying tax in the UK. However, since then it has become more associated with ultra-wealthy people spending much of their time in the UK while paying less tax than they would if they were “domiciled” in Britain. The non-doms were liable for £8.9bn in UK income tax, capital gains tax and national insurance contributions for 2023, or about £120,000 per person. The non-doms were liable for £474m in extra tax compared with the year before, likely because of the temporary health and social care levy, which charged an additional 1.25 percentage points in national insurance from 6 April 2022 to 6 November 2022. The number of non-domiciled taxpayers was still 3,600 short of the total before the coronavirus pandemic. BP is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 today after it said that it will produce less oil than expected and refinery profits will drop by as much as $700m. Shares in the oil supermajor fell by 4% after it warned that the fall in output and declining profits from its refineries would hurt second-quarter profits. Its oil trading performance will also be “weak” compared with a strong first quarter. The warning will be a blow to chief executive Murray Auchincloss’s hopes to persuade investors that it can close a valuation gap with US rivals. Auchincloss last month froze hiring on offshore wind projects to try to placate investors who are apparently concerned about the company’s green targets. Although BP officially recognises the climate crisis and the need to shift to zero emissions, Auchincloss has slowed its transition away from fossil fuels. BP will also have a charge of up to $2bn as it reviews the future of its refinery in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Reuters reported that analysts cut profit forecasts: Citi analysts lowered their Q2 earnings per share estimate by 9% while Jefferies analysts expected the update to result in a 20% earnings downgrade. Sewage pollution from ageing Thames Water treatment works that have not been upgraded increased last year, causing the company to again fail to meet its legal targets, according to its financial report. Across the Thames Water area, the number of incidents of pollution from treatment works and the pipe network increased to 350, compared with 331 in 2022. The rise was attributed to delays in investment to create more capacity at many of the company’s 400 ageing sewage treatment works. Chris Weston, Thames Water’s chief executive, said the works could not cope with a 40% increase in rainfall and exceptionally high levels of groundwater. Asked why Thames had failed for many years to invest in upgrading treatment works, Weston repeated that the works were “old”. He said: “They require a lot of development, a lot of investment into things like putting in storm tanks. All of that takes time and requires a lot of investment on top of what we have done already.” The company said there had been a “significant increase in sewage treatment works pollutions” in the year, caused by delays to pollution improvement engineering programmes, as well as the installation of more monitoring at works. You can read the full report here: The Liberal Democrats – buoyant after their surge in seats at the general election – have described Thames Water as a “rogue firm”, and called for blocks on dividends or bill hikes from the company. Thames Water has long argued that it needs to raise bills in order to pay for investments to upgrade its creaking pipes. However, the Lib Dems found the UK’s polluted waterways to be a strong campaign issue. Many of its election gains also happen to map onto areas supplied by Thames Water – notably the affluent towns up the Thames and into Oxfordshire. Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson whose Richmond Park constituency is bordered by the Thames, said: This is a complete mess and it’s time the regulator started blocking Thames Water’s planned dividend payouts and eye-watering bill hikes. Years of inaction from Conservative Ministers has lead to these bill increases and firms getting away with endless sewage dumps and insulting bonuses. It is clear the public want action to be taken to finally crackdown on this rogue firm. The government and regulator should listen to this call. The idea of nationalisation of the UK’s water supply did not seem to be on the cards during the 14 years of Conservative rule (although in the case of the railways the party did relax its apparent aversion to public ownership). But could a Labour government be more open to it? The party has firmly said that it is not planning to nationalise the company. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds last month told an election debate that “people should not expect the state to bail out bad investments”. Its hand may be forced if the water company cannot find investors, but some campaigners think nationalisation would be a better deal for taxpayers (as long as shareholders are not bailed out). Matthew Topham, lead campaigner at public ownership campaign group We Own It, said: Today’s latest crisis is being used to set the scene for the same old story that we’ve come to expect from water privatisation: shareholders mismanage a vital public service and who do they expect to pick up the tab? Households, taxpayers, and our waterways. Water privatisation may have lined overseas shareholders’ pockets, but it failed to deliver for the public or for our rivers and seas. It’s high time that this government takes Thames Water into Special Administration and then transfers it to local councils to run, giving anti-sewage campaigners, local residents, and water experts seats on its board. The public shouldn’t lose twice. Reckless shareholders and creditors should be paying the price for their failure. As Thames Water circles the drain, we have a unique opportunity to join nearly every other country in the world and run our water not for private profit, but for the people of this country who rely on it. The new chancellor Rachel Reeves is summoning City bosses to Whitehall, as she prepares to launch a promised £7.3bn national wealth fund. Labour has been crafting the fund for months, having appointed a taskforce involving top financial figures, including former Bank of England governor Mark Carney and Barclays boss CS Venkatakrishnan, to hash out details of an important manifesto pledge. Aviva chief executive Amanda Blanc is among the taskforce members due to gather at the chancellor’s office at Number 11 Downing Street at midday to launch the fund, which is meant to attract £3 of private funds for every £1 of public cash, in a bid to accelerate investment in key infrastructure projects up and down the UK. Those projects are expected to include ports, gigafactories for electric car batteries, carbon capture and hydrogen projects and steel operations The chief executives of the UK Infrastructure Bank and British Business Bank has also been invited, as both institutions are set to play a key role in the fund, which would otherwise overlap with some of their operations. An announcement is expected in the early afternoon. Members of Labour’s national wealth fund taskforce included: Chair: Rhian-Mari Thomas, chief executive of the Green Finance Institute Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England Amanda Blanc, chief executive Aviva CS Venkat, chief executive Barclays Hugh Crossley, chief executive of Equitix David Vickers, chief investment officer of Brunel Pension Carol Young, chief executive of USS, the university superannuation scheme Thames Water has been criticised for allegedly prioritising investors over pollution, after profits and the number of pollution incidents both rose. The company on Tuesday said that higher rainfall had increased the number of “pollutions” in the year to March 2024 by 6% to 350, compared to 331 in the previous year. James Wallace, chief executive of River Action, which campaigns against pollution, said: There is nothing to cheer as this failing water company, the largest in Europe, continues to desperately prioritise the interests of investors and lenders before the health of rivers and river users. As we found recently on the stretch of the Thames used for the Henley Royal Regatta, leaking infrastructure managed by Thames Water leads to dangerously high levels of human sewage entering rivers in their catchment on a daily basis. With a newly elected Labour government promising to clean up our rivers and seas, it is time for urgent action to tackle the freshwater emergency, partly caused by polluting water companies. A good first start would be for the government to properly resource the environmental regulators such as the Environment Agency in England to ensure they can police and prosecute polluters. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, an investment platform, said that Thames Water’s money “reservoir” was shrinking. It can still tap funding of around £1.8 billion, until spring next year but it’s a reservoir that’s been shrinking. At the same time, its debt pile is an even bigger millstone and risks pulling the business under. For now, the company is treading water, but it’s been in a more precarious position after shareholders at the parent company Kemble Water held off from injecting cash into the business over a row with the regulator Ofwat regarding how high bills could be put up by 2030 to enable it to pay for critical repairs. Thames Water has £15.2bn of debt, up £1.3bn on the previous year, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse if the government stepped in to renationalise the troubled company. The Guardian revealed in April a contingency plan, codenamed Project Timber, was being drawn up in Whitehall to renationalise Britain’s biggest water company if it collapses. Thames said it was “reasonable” to assume it would have sufficient resources to continue operating until at least April 2025, but there were “material uncertainties”. These included not securing commitments for future funding, a downgrade to its credit rating or a failure to meet its legal obligations. On Thursday, Ofwat will give its first view on five-year business plans submitted by English and Welsh water companies, including Thames, last year. You can read the full story here: Indivior, which makes the opioid addiction treatments Suboxone and Sublocade, has issued a profit warning and said it would cut 130 jobs as it stops selling its schizophrenia treatment Perseris. The news sent its share price plummeting by 36% to their lowest since the summer of 2021. The shares at £7.30 are down 63% from their peak above £20 in early 2023. Mark Crossley, the chief executive, said the company was reducing its full-year guidance partly because the end of Covid-19 emergency measures related to automatic Medicaid coverage renewals in the US had impacted its Sublocade revenues more than expected. Indivior, which has been exploring whether to move its main share listing from London to New York, now expects to make an adjusted operating profit of between $285m and £320m this year, down from $330m to $380m forecast in May. However, Crossley remains confident that Sublocade’s “unique profile to address high-powered synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, provides us with a tremendous opportunity to meet the growing and changing needs of patients”. As a result, the company expects Sublocade, an injected prescription medicine that treats moderate to severe opioid use disorder, to hit net revenues of $1bn “as we exit 2025,” and to achieve peak annual revenues of more than $1.5bn. Indivior said: The group remains confident that given the scale of the US opioid epidemic, which is now being driven by misuse of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, its opportunity to help patients and deliver value for shareholders remains intact. The company is ceasing all sales and marketing of Perseris immediately due o the “highly competitive market” and payor changes in the US. It will continue to supply Perseris “for the forseeable future” to avoid disruption to patient care but will no longer have a dedicated salesforce, resulting in 130 job losses. The changes are expected to result in charges of $65m. Indivior said it had reached an $85m settlement with health Care Service of Florida, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and others to resolve anti-trust litigation in Roanoke County Circuit Court in Virgina, pending since 2020. Last year, Indivior, and its former parent company, the consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser, from which it was spun off in 2014, faced a lawsuit in London’s high court over allegedly false marketing of Suboxone, but the case was thrown out in December. The US justice department in 2019 charged Indivior with fraudulently claiming Suboxone film was better and safer than similar drugs. Reckitt agreed to pay a $1.4bn fine to settle the case in July 2019, without any admission of wrongdoing, while Indivior said in 2020 that it had “pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement relating to healthcare matters in 2012” and that it would “make payments to federal and state authorities totalling $600m over a period of seven years”. Shaun Thaxter, the former Indivior chief executive, was sentenced to six months in federal prison in 2020 after pleading guilty to his role in a scheme to secure Medicaid coverage for Suboxone film by misleading officials about its dangers to children. Thaxter was replaced by Crossley, the former chief financial and operations officer, who has worked at the company since 2017. Thames Water’s financial situation is shocking, but its political impact has partly been caused by the disgusting facts of what happens when things go wrong: raw sewage flowing into the UK’s rivers. The company on Tuesday said that the number of “pollutions” in the year to March 2024 had increased to 350, compared to 331 in the previous year. That is a 6% increase. Thames Water said that was “driven by a 40% increase in average rainfall” and that “The number of serious pollutions decreased by 18%”. Responding to Thames Water’s annual results, Paul de Zylva, senior sustainability analyst at Friends of the Earth, an environmental campaign group, said: Water companies have had free license to line their shareholders’ pockets handsomely for decades while letting our rivers and seas fill with sewage and infrastructure crumble. Failed regulation has allowed Thames Water’s past and present owners to extract money, and to burden the company with debts running at over £19bn. It’s staggering that the company is still counting on weak regulation to allow it to survive by pushing its problems onto its customers – asking Ofwat to allow it increase bills by a shocking 59%. This means bill payers being left to subsidise what little it’s prepared to invest towards fixing the pollution and sewage scandal. The regulator must end this license for water companies to profit from pollution, while wildlife and our health is put at risk. Proper regulation means Ofwat must make Thames Water and other water companies pay for the clean-up needed without passing on higher bills to us. It also means proper fines for polluting and an end to water bosses getting high pay and bonuses for failure. Vistry Group, the house builder formerly known as Boris Homes, expects to build more than 18,000 homes this year, up nearly 12% from last year, as it prepares to work with Keir Starmer’s government to tackle the UK’s housing crisis. Greg Fitzgerald, the chief executive, said: We look forward to working with the new government to address the country’s housing crisis and are extremely well placed to support its ambition of delivering the biggest boost to affordable housing in a generation. Housebuilding shares jumped on news of the landslide Labour victory last Friday, as the party has pledged to tackle planning issues and build 1.5m homes in the next five years. Vistry expects to make an adjusted profit before tax of £186m in the first six months of the year, up 7%, with completions rising by 8% to 7,750 homes. It sad it had benefited from lower building material costs compared with last year. Vistry’s share price rose by 0.6%. The Kent-based company works with local authorities, housing associations and private rental firms to deliver affordable housing. Those partnerships are set to fund 75% of all completions this year. Vistry has seen a pick-up in demand from the private rented sector, while traditional registered providers of social housing are currently focusing on maintenance and remediation of existing housing, particularly in London. In May, Vistry sold a further 1,750 homes to the private rental company Leaf Living, which was set up in 2021 by Regis and the US fund manager Blackstone. Most of the homes are expected to complete within the next couple of years. RBC Capital Markets analyst Anthony Codling said: The election of Labour is good news for Vistry. With its focus on build rates and partnership homes, it is likely to become the teacher’s pet of the Labour government. Working closely with local authorities could provide a win-win, helping councils meet their housing needs, the government its housing targets, and delivering more choice to renters and homebuyers. Investec’s housing analyst Aynsley Lammin concurred, saying: The partnerships model continues to underpin a relatively strong performance against a weak private open market … The open market still looks constrained, but with some positive momentum and firm pricing with sales incentives continuing. London’s benchmark stock index has not followed Tokyo’s lead: the FTSE 100 has dropped 0.1% at the opening bell. Perhaps London’s lack of chip companies or tech stocks might have something to do with that… although the rest of Europe is no different. Here are the rest of the opening snaps, via Reuters, from across Europe: EUROPE’S STOXX 600 DOWN 0.2% GERMANY’S DAX DOWN 0.3% FRANCE’S CAC 40 DOWN 0.3%, SPAIN’S IBEX DOWN 0.4% EURO STOXX INDEX DOWN 0.3%; EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS DOWN 0.3% Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Thames Water has said that it has enough cash to keep it going until May 2025, as potential investors await the outcome of negotiation with the UK regulator. The company, which provides water to London and the Thames Valley in the south-east of England, is in a parlous financial state. Keir Starmer, the new prime minister, and Rachel Reeves, the new chancellor, have been briefed that the company presents a “critical risk” to the country. Thames Water Utilities Limited, the regulated subsidiary, on Tuesday said it had £1.8bn in cash and other liquid assets “sufficient to fund our operations for the next 11 months to the end of May 2025”. Following the draft determination and our response to Ofwat we will be engaging with potential investors and creditors to seek new equity and to extend our liquidity runway. Any equity process is not expected to conclude until after the final determination. The company reported a 10% increase in revenues to £2.4bn in the year to 31 March as it raised bills in line with inflation, and scraped to a profit of £75m. It also said that it spent a record £2.1bn as it maintained and upgraded its ageing pipe network. Chris Weston, chief executive of Thames Water since December, said he believed the business could be turned around. He said: The challenges we face are well documented, but our operational and financial performance for the last year show good progress, and these positive results provide the right foundations on which to build and improve. Japan’s Nikkei index hits new record Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed at a new record high on Tuesday, the latest in a series of records amid a global surge in investor interest in artificial intelligence companies. Computer chip semiconductor companies – who have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of the rally – helped the index to a 2% gain on Tuesday, outpacing other Asian stock indices. The index closed at a record high of 41,580.17 on Tuesday, after rising as high as 41,769.35 during afternoon trading. The Nikkei had taken decades to surpass its previous peak, hit during the 1989 bubble. On the final trading day of 1989, it had closed at 38,915.87; that level was reached again in February, 34 years later.",

        "title": "‘Who buys a retail brand during Covid?’ The man who revived salad chain Tossed",
        "content": "Neil Sebba, the managing director of healthy eating chain Tossed, does not take long when asked if he is a risk-taker. “Yes: who buys a brand in Covid in a market that is completely dead?” he says, reflecting on the decision he and co-owner Angelina Harrisson took to buy the business out of administration in September 2020. Sitting in Tossed’s Victoria Street branch in central London during the lunchtime rush, Sebba tucks into a cauliflower and harissa salad, a combination to which he says he has become addicted. The shop is the picture of a modern food outlet. Dance music is pumped through the brightly lit interior while customers choose their custom-made salads or wraps on touchscreens, which offer nutritional information on every choice. It is a scene that looked impossible four years ago, when Tossed nearly vanished completely. A casualty of Covid-19, the chain relied on the lunchtime office market, which was wiped out by lockdowns. Within months of the coronavirus outbreak, it had plunged into administration, closing its 14 stores and letting 260 employees go. “Effectively, the music stopped, and you are thinking, do we have enough chairs to sit on?” he says. “I had to see if the business was viable, and then make everyone redundant and put the business into administration.” It proved a defining moment for Sebba, who joined Tossed in 2010, five years after it was founded by the entrepreneur Vincent McKevitt. His childhood was a world away from Tossed’s busy central London heartland: he grew up near the Suffolk village of Nayland. But trips to work with his father, the managing director of a property company, gave him a glimpse of City life, and he set his sights on a career in finance while at Warwick University. After six years at accountancy firm BDO, he joined Cornerstone Corporate Finance, where he spent four years raising money for hospitality businesses, including Wagamama. “It frustrated me: you kept helping businesses to write up plans but never got to help them to carry them out,” Sebba says. Disillusioned, he took the biggest risk of his life. Months away from his wedding, he wrote to McKevitt, unsolicited, to offer his services. He resigned from Cornerstone and worked for nothing to raise money for Tossed on the proviso that he would be made finance director if successful. During Sebba’s nine years in charge of the numbers, after he’d raised the money, Tossed grew to 32 stores, including franchised outlets, across the UK, and two in Dubai. With Harrisson, he in effect began running the business. And then Covid hit. “It’s a weird situation. Everybody is on furlough and you become very isolated; it was very lonely,” he says. “It’s hard not to feel responsible, even though you clearly have no control over Covid, but you have people looking to you for answers.” Tossed was not alone. Analysis from PwC in 2021 found that 17,500 chain store outlets disappeared as a direct result of Covid-19. Sebba was determined that the Tossed brand would survive. He called Harrisson, who is now brand director, and suggested a relaunch. The pair delved into their contacts books to raise £500,000, renegotiated leases and opened five shops in September 2020. “We made the decision when there wasn’t even a vaccine: we were shooting blind,” he says. By that winter, with the virus rampant, the pair doubled down, hunting for more shops. “Snow was covering London and I was walking around the city looking for new stores, with not a single other person around. It was like a 28 Days Later scenario,” he says. The gamble paid off. Tossed now has 13 shops across London, offering salads marketed as “gym food”, hot curries and “big fat Greek” yoghurts. But Sebba is keen to stress the different environment it now operates in. First, the move towards hybrid working has meant that there are many fewer people travelling into the city, particularly on Mondays and Fridays. Sebba pulls across his laptop to call up the latest Transport for London data, which shows that, on 21 June, the number of Friday tube journeys was 3.56m, down from 4.54m on the same date in 2019. “We’ve got fewer purchasing opportunities and you are basically trading on three and a half days a week,” says Sebba. He adds that there is some evidence that commuters are willing to spend more than before on the days they travel in. However, the cost of living crisis has necessitated putting more affordable options on to menus: non-customised salads and wraps costing about £6 now sit alongside its typical salads, which are priced just under £10. Meanwhile, costs have kept pressure on its balance sheet. “You’ve got inflationary pressure coming from food costs, inflation, living wage rates and the electric,” he says. With footfall down, Sebba has built up Tossed’s deliveries business, which includes a kitchen in Canary Wharf. He says this market has also been bolstered by companies offering lunch to employees as a perk to get them to come into the office. To help make the business more efficient, Tossed now uses the platform Stint to hire casual staff for brief periods to match footfall.

        "title": "BP to take hit of nearly $3bn amid oil refining woes",
        "content": "BP is preparing to take a hit of almost $3bn (£2.3bn) in its results for April to June as lower demand for fuels leads to woes within the company’s oil refining business. The oil supermajor warned investors that “significantly lower realised refining margins” could wipe between $500m and $700m from its earnings for the quarter. It also expects to take a $2bn writedown resulting from a plan to scale back its refining operations at its Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany by a third from next year in response to weaker demand. The looming financial hit comes amid wider pressures facing the global refining business. The US oil company ExxonMobil warned investors this week that lower refining margins would have a negative impact on second-quarter profit of between $1.1bn and $1.5bn. BP added that its oil trading business was “expected to be weak”, while gas trading was expected to be “average”. The update caused BP shares to drop by more than 3.5% to 457.76p a share on Tuesday morning. On Monday it was reported that the company’s ousted former chief executive, Bernard Looney, had met senior figures in the United Arab Emirates in the hopes of securing private equity investment to fund a new oil venture. Looney was sacked from the company last year for failing to disclose his relationships with colleagues to the board. The Irishman had reportedly held talks with Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, and with Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE’s powerful national security adviser and businessman, according to the Financial Times. Looney is not understood to be in talks with the UAE’s state oil company, Adnoc. The British oil and gas multinational Shell is also expected to take an impairment charge of up to $2bn in its next set of results after it was forced to halt work on Europe’s largest sustainable aviation fuel project in Rotterdam and sell off a Singapore refinery. The company plans to pull back on investments through its low-carbon division in favour of investment in growing its gas business. It said on Tuesday that it would move ahead with plans to develop a gas field east of Trinidad and Tobago.",

        "title": "Rise in sewage pollution from Thames Water’s ageing treatment works",
        "content": "Sewage pollution from ageing Thames Water treatment works that have not been upgraded increased last year, causing the company to again fail to meet its legal targets, according to its financial report. Across the Thames Water area, the number of incidents of pollution from treatment works and the pipe network increased to 350, compared with 331 in 2022. The rise was attributed to delays in investment to create more capacity at many of the company’s 400 ageing sewage treatment works. Chris Weston, Thames Water’s chief executive, said the works could not cope with a 40% increase in rainfall and exceptionally high levels of groundwater. Asked why Thames had failed for many years to invest in upgrading treatment works, Weston repeated that the works were “old”. He said: “They require a lot of development, a lot of investment into things like putting in storm tanks. All of that takes time and requires a lot of investment on top of what we have done already.” The company said there had been a “significant increase in sewage treatment works pollutions” in the year, caused by delays to pollution improvement engineering programmes, as well as the installation of more monitoring at works. The need for improvements at the huge treatment works at Mogden in south-west London, and delayed works to increase capacity at treatment works in Witney in Oxfordshire, Chesham in Buckinghamshire, and Fairford in Gloucestershire were given as reasons for the rise in pollution incidents. Campaigners in these areas have raised concerns for many years about pollution into rivers from the treatment works. In March, sewage was pumped into the River Chess from the Chesham treatment works for more than 800 hours over more than a month. Thames Water admitted the works had “a history of prolonged storm discharges”. Weston said: “Pollutions are a massive area of focus for Thames. We deal with over 5bn litres of sewage of waste every day. All of that has to be treated through sewage treatment works. People in Thames Water go to extraordinary lengths to make sure that the network is functioning as it should and do all they can to avoid pollution. “Rain has a huge impact on spills. Our sewage treatment works can only take a certain capacity and we have to protect them. When we get adverse rainfall as we did in February, it is a volume that our treatment works were never designed to cope with.” Thames Water is at the centre of an Ofwat investigation into widespread illegal sewage dumping across its treatment works and faces huge fines. The Environment Agency is conducting a criminal investigation into illegal sewage dumping from its network. In its business plan to 2030, which has been submitted to Ofwat, the company is seeking to be treated differently from all other water companies and face lower fines for polluting rivers, as it attempts to stay afloat. Thames, which has debts of almost £15bn, wants to be allowed to raise bills by 59% to pay for investment in infrastructure, as well as paying out higher dividends to its shareholders. The company has admitted it has been sweating assets for many years and said bills needed to rise to pay for the investment. Ofwat is due to make a draft determination on the business plan on Thursday. Weston said one of the reasons the company was putting forward a plan with significant investment was to tackle its ageing treatment works. Paul de Zylva, a senior sustainability analyst at Friends of the Earth, said: “Water companies have had free licence to line their shareholders’ pockets handsomely for decades while letting our rivers and seas fill with sewage and infrastructure crumble. “It’s staggering that the company is still counting on weak regulation to allow it to survive by pushing its problems on to its customers – asking Ofwat to allow it to increase bills by a shocking 59%. This means bill payers being left to subsidise what little it’s prepared to invest towards fixing the pollution and sewage scandal. The regulator must end this licence for water companies to profit from pollution, while wildlife and our health is put at risk.” James Wallace, CEO of campaign group River Action, said: “There is nothing to cheer as this failing water company, the largest in Europe, continues to desperately prioritise the interests of investors and lenders before the health of rivers and river users. A good first start would be for the government to properly resource the environmental regulators such as the Environment Agency in England to ensure they can police and prosecute polluters.”",

        "title": "Thames Water to tap investors for funds as it will run out of cash by next June",
        "content": "Thames Water said it intended to tap investors for fresh funds as it would run out of money by next June without a cash injection, raising fears over its potential collapse. The debt-laden company, which has faced sustained criticism over sewage dumps, leaky pipes and extracted dividends, said it had £1.8bn, “sufficient to fund our operations for the next 11 months to the end of May 2025”. In financial results for the year to 31 March, Thames said revenues rose 10% to £2.4bn as a result of “inflation linked” increases in the amount it charged for water and wastewater services. Profits jumped 21% driven by higher revenues and “cost discipline”. Thames has £15.2bn of debt, up £1.3bn on the previous year, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse if the government stepped in to renationalise the troubled company. The Guardian revealed in April a contingency plan was being drawn up in Whitehall to renationalise Britain’s biggest water company if it collapses. Thames said it was “reasonable” to assume it would have sufficient resources to continue operating until at least April 2025, but there were “material uncertainties”. These included not securing commitments for future funding, a downgrade to its credit rating or a failure to meet its legal obligations, which could trigger a default on its debts. The situation is so severe that the new prime minister, Keir Starmer, and chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been briefed by Whitehall officials that the poor state of Thames presents a “critical risk” to the country during their first few days in office. Chris Weston, the chief executive of Thames who joined in January, said the company could still find a solution in the financial markets without need for government intervention, depending on decisions by its regulator, Ofwat. He added that a temporary nationalisation “is something that is not in the interests of any of our stakeholders or the UK taxpayer. “I can’t put any probability on whether it will or won’t happen, but it is a long way off if it were to happen. There is a lot more that we can do … to make sure that does not happen.” Weston said “it is extremely early days”, but the company has been in touch with the new government and would have discussions “as appropriate” in the near future. On Thursday, Ofwat will give its first view on five-year business plans submitted last year by English and Welsh water companies, including Thames. Thames intended to contact potential investors after Ofwat’s documents had been published. Weston said a “broach church” of investors would be approached, with a formal process beginning in autumn and expected to stretch into 2025. The Ofwat review will indicate by how much Thames will be allowed to raise bills – which the company wants to increase by 59% - and whether its £19.7bn investment plan, intended in part to fix leaky pipes and prevent sewage spills, will be approved. The company, which serves 16 million customers in the London and Thames valley regions, said it was working on the basis that an injection of new equity was “possible” but “should no longer be assumed”. The number of pollution incidents increased to 350 last year, up on 331 in 2022, which Thames said was driven by a deluge of higher than average rainfall. “It is a volume that our networks were never designed to cope with,” Weston said. The slow-burn crisis at Thames Water stepped up in March, when it said shareholders – which include the pension funds USS and Omers – had U-turned on £500m of promised funding, claiming Ofwat had made the company “uninvestable”. Its parent company, Kemble, defaulted on its debt in April. The Guardian has since revealed that Thames’s board approved a £150m dividend just hours before the announcement and Ofwat is studying the payout. Gary Carter, a national officer at the GMB union, said: “Thames operating profits have improved so now is the time for its shareholders to back the company the equity required to cut leakage and sewage spills. “The shareholders are starving Thames of the cash required to keep ageing assets going.” Paul de Zylva, the senior sustainability analyst at Friends of the Earth, said: “Proper regulation means Ofwat must make Thames Water and other water companies pay for the clean-up needed without passing on higher bills to us. It also means proper fines for polluting and an end to water bosses getting high pay and bonuses for failure.” Thames’s annual report showed Weston picked up £437,000 for his first few months in the job, including a £195,000 bonus. His predecessor, Sarah Bentley – who resigned abruptly in June 2023 – received £436,429 during her notice period.",

        "title": "Retail sales dip in June as UK’s cooler weather and cost of living bite",
        "content": "UK retail sales slumped last month as cold weather deterred shoppers from buying summer clothing and gardening supplies, despite pressure easing on households amid a slowdown of inflation. The latest snapshot from the British Retail Consortium showed a 0.2% drop in total UK retail sales compared against June last year. Highlighting the pressure on retailers amid a wider slowdown in spending as households grapple with the cost of living crisis, the trade body blamed the drop on unseasonably cold weather. “Retail sales performed poorly in June as the cooler weather during the first half of the month dulled consumer spending,” said the BRC’s chief executive, Helen Dickinson. “Sales of weather-sensitive categories such as clothing and footwear, as well as DIY and gardening were hit particularly hard, especially compared to the surge in spending during last June’s heatwave.” The gloomy consumer outlook comes as high Bank of England interest rates continue to weigh on household spending power. While inflation has returned to the 2% target set by the government, prices still remain significantly higher than before the cost of living crisis took hold. Separate figures from Barclays also released on Tuesday showed card spending fell 0.6% in June, the first decline since February 2021, as cold weather sapped consumer demand and forced some fashion brands to adjust their sales schedules. However, it said entertainment had remained a staple among Britons, with strong growth in spending on pub visits, takeaways and digital streaming services. Experts said some of the sales weakness could be explained by the year-on-year comparison with June 2023, when sales had been particularly strong. Sarah Bradbury, the chief executive of the data provider IGD, said hot weather in the final week of June this year helped to boost spending. “While the election campaign has not impacted shopper confidence during June, we might expect to see a boost following the election. We have seen a positive bump for shopper confidence immediately following the three previous general elections, therefore we should expect something similar as we move through July,” she added. The BRC said it expected retail sales to bounce back over the coming months, helped by the men’s Euro 2024 tournament. “Electronics sales had a better month as football fans cheering on their national teams upgraded their home entertainment systems and people replaced their pandemic purchases,” she added. “Retailers remain hopeful that as the summer social season gets into full swing and the weather improves, sales will follow suit.”",

        "title": "Will my heat pump be a noise nuisance to my neighbours?",
        "content": "By the end of the decade, well over 60m heat pumps could be warming homes across Europe, according to industry figures, as government policies target household carbon emissions. In the UK, the newly appointed energy and net zero secretary, Ed Miliband, has committed to maintaining the heat pump grants offered by the previous government to help to accelerate the rollout of the technology. The total effect of this switch away from fossil fuel heating to low-carbon alternatives could cut CO2 emissions across Europe by 46%, but critics of the technology point to another cumulative impact: noise. Heat pumps are designed to be installed outside the home to extract warmth from the air, ground or water. In densely populated areas, this could mean scores of heat pump fans humming within a small area. One device typically emits a constant hum of between 40 and 60 decibels – about the same as a fridge or dishwasher – but could millions of heat pumps amount to a noise nuisance? The claim Concerns about heat pump noise began to take hold in the British press late last year after the Conservative government commissioned an independent review into noise emissions from air source heat pumps. Research submitted included a report by three experts presented at the Institute of Acoustics conference last October. It was seized on by the Daily Telegraph, which reported that it had found heat pumps were “too noisy for millions of homes in the UK”. The report contained a claim that heat pumps installed in flats or terraced houses would break the noise limits set by the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS), an accreditation body, which stipulate that a heat pump should be no louder than 42 decibels within one metre of a neighbour’s door or window. The Daily Mail and Daily Express repeated the story a day later. Concerns about the issue appeared in the Guardian, too, with one reader’s letter complaining that a summer stay in a development where all eight properties had heat pumps was marred by the devices. “If you sat in the garden in the evening, it was an annoying, continual source of noise,” the writer said. The science The main source of heat pump noise is the fan, which draws in air, and the compressor, which raises the temperature of the refrigerant by increasing pressure on its gases. (You can read more about exactly how a heat pump works here.) Typically an air source heat pump will run at a decibel level of about 40, but it can reach 60 on particularly cold days when it needs to work harder to draw extra heat from the air. This would put it in a similar noise range as a fridge – or a gas boiler. Older devices have typically been noisier than the latest ones. Some manufacturers produce low-noise heat pumps, which sacrifice a little in terms of efficiency to offer a quieter experience. The Guardian reader’s experience may have been due to improper installation or the use of older, noisier heat pump models, according to Jack Harvie-Clark, a director at Apex Acoustics. “Modern heat pumps can be significantly quieter, and proper placement – away from property boundaries – can further reduce noise impact,” he said. Apex was one of the consultancies behind the report cited by the Telegraph. It was quick to rebuff the coverage, describing its “misleading” claims that heat pumps were too noisy for millions of UK homes as “an exaggeration”. “While noise is a valid concern … technology improvements and proper installation can mitigate noise issues in most homes. The article presents noise as an insurmountable problem, which is not the case,” the company said, pointing out that there were many homes – typically detached and semi-detached properties – where there would be no problem at all. Last November the UK government published the results of its review, which found that noise emissions were a concern for a minority of consumers, with a low incidence of complaints. In the chancellor’s autumn statement later that month, it was announced that the government would consult on changing rules that apply in England, including removing the one-metre boundary rule. The government’s research included a survey of households living within 50 metres of a heat pump, across 60 areas with high heat pump uptake, to gauge noise nuisance inside the house. It asked respondents to specify which neighbourhood noises could be heard from indoors. Heat pumps received one of the lowest number of mentions, while dogs topped the list. The study found that 57% of the 139 respondents noticed barking during the day, and just 4% noticed the sound of a heat pump. Harvie-Clark has done further research on the issue for Nesta, an innovation charity, which is due to be published this month. Its findings suggest that even in worst-case scenarios with high housing density and all air source heat pumps operating simultaneously at maximum permitted sound power levels, the cumulative noise impact was not likely to be more significant than the individual noise impact of the nearest neighbour’s heat pump. “I’ve also investigated in detail how some other European countries manage noise from air source heat pumps,” Harvie-Clark said. “Most have higher noise limits in the daytime and some, but not all, have slightly lower limits in the night-time. “We [in the UK] have one noise level limit for all times, which to me seems clumsy. The main manufacturers see northern Europe as one market, so they all have controls that can limit operation to lower noise levels at night-time The caveats Although potential noise issues can be mitigated, Harvie-Clark believes that more work should be done to understand the impact of heat pumps as they gain popularity across Europe, and he has stressed that consumer education is key to ensuring that the right heat pump is installed in the right way. For example, the government’s review of whether heat pump noise is noticeable has some notable limitations: heat pumps are not widely used, so even an area of “high density” will include fewer heat pumps than there will be in the future. There are other issues with the way noise limits are characterised. For example, a heat pump’s defrost cycle, which is louder than its normal running level, is not included in MCS’s noise tests. “Nor is low-frequency noise, nor any information on tonality or directionality,” said Harvie-Clark. “So these things cannot by definition be taken into account in any calculation or assessment prior to installation.” The verdict Heat pumps are quieter than they used to be, and getting quieter still. But better consumer information could go further in mitigating the overall impact of noise by choosing the best model for the home and using it correctly. “I believe that many people in the UK try to operate their heat pumps the way they operate gas boilers – turning them on and off – but they can’t heat houses as quickly as gas boilers, so they need to run constantly to do that,” said Harvie-Clark. Turning heat pumps on after a period of being off will require the machine to work harder and therefore create more noise. So taking a slow and steady approach to home heating can make heat pumps more efficient, and quieter, too. “In colder European countries they accept that this is how to run heating systems. Our temperate climate means people have different control expectations,” Harvie-Clark said. “While the potential noise impact of air source heat pumps should be considered, it is important to balance this with the significant environmental benefits of transitioning away from fossil fuel heating systems. Gas boilers also make a noise.”",

It was the second such incident for the airline this year. The aircraft involved in Monday’s incident was a nearly 30-year-old Boeing 757-200, according to FlightRadar24 data, which was carrying 174 passengers and 7 crew members. Boeing ended production of the 757 in 2004. In March, a United Airlines Boeing 777-200 jet headed for Japan lost a tire mid-air after takeoff from San Francisco, landing safely at Los Angeles International Airport. The wheel landed on a car in an airport employee parking lot, breaking a car window, but no one was hurt. Monday’s incident was the latest in a string of incidents involving United Airlines planes. One aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles international airport in March due to an issue with its hydraulic system. Elsewhere that month, another flight was attempting to land in Houston when it rolled off the taxiway and into the grass. Also in March, a flight carrying 167 passengers made an emergency landing in Houston, after bright flames burst out of the engine of the United flight 1118, a Boeing 737-900 en route from Houston to Fort Myers, Florida. US flight issues were catapulted into the headline in January, after a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 in mid-air, shortly after it took off from Portland Oregon, forcing it to make an emergency landing. Several people were injured. In April, United Airlines blamed a $200m (£161m) hit to its earnings in the first three months of the year on the incident, saying the mid-flight blowout on rival Alaska airlines forced it to ground many of its Boeing planes, contributing to the losses.

        "title": "Poor state of Thames Water a ‘critical risk’ to UK, Starmer and Reeves told",
        "content": "The prime minister and chancellor have been briefed by Whitehall officials that the poor state of Thames Water presents a “critical risk” to the country, the Guardian understands. Fears about the company go beyond its precarious financial position and include the management of sites that provide drinking water and sewage treatment for millions of customers across the capital and the Thames valley. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves were first to be briefed on the issue. They were warned by civil servants that the dire state of Thames’s infrastructure is one of the most urgent problems facing the new government, according to sources. The condition of Coppermills, a vast water treatment works in north-east London that serves as many as 3 million people, is particularly alarming, ministers and aides have been told. The site is classed among the UK’s most important pieces of national infrastructure. A financial update on Tuesday is due to reveal more about the frayed finances of Britain’s biggest water company. Thames’s annual results will be followed on Thursday by an initial verdict from the water watchdog Ofwat on water companies’ five-year spending plans and bill increases. Thames was among a list of “critical risks” that require urgent attention, with its potential financial collapse considered a potential “major threat to critical national infrastructure”, according to briefings given to the prime minister and chancellor. Management failings have added to fears of potential “widespread disruption to essential services” caused by crumbling infrastructure, it is understood. It has been reported that the ailing water company is among the top priorities of the prime minister’s chief of staff, Sue Gray. On Monday, the PM’s spokesperson suggested that the government would prefer not to nationalise the company, saying it doesn’t “think it’s the right course of action”. They added: “Instead, the government’s focused on holding these companies to account, ensuring they’re investing and improving our systems rather than rewarding themselves.” Nevertheless, the government will have no choice but to move to safeguard London’s water supply should Thames’s finances fail. Thames is the most indebted of the UK’s water monopolies and is labouring under a £15.6bn debt pile. Its finances have been left threadbare after previous shareholders, led by the Australian bank Macquarie, siphoned out billions of pounds of dividends and it was fined for pollution and leaks. Emergency plans drawn up by Whitehall and seen by the Guardian would turn the company into a publicly owned arm’s-length body under the state’s special administration regime. This would ensure that it can continue to provide water and sewage treatment services to its 16 million customers in London and the Thames valley. Thames is burning through its cash reserves as it struggles to attract new investment. Last month it was revealed by the Guardian that the company agreed to pay a £150m dividend in late March – hours before its existing shareholders U-turned on providing £500m of emergency funding. Concerns about its future rest not only on its financial position. Officials are fearful of the ability of the company to make and manage essential improvements to is creaking operations and infrastructure. In a sign of how serious concerns about its future are, the debate is being weighed at No 10 and 11, rather than solely at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which has been working on rescue plans with the Treasury. A spokesperson for Defra said: “We are closely monitoring the situation and the company remains stable.” A source close to Steve Reed, the newly appointed Defra secretary of state, said: “We are in this situation because of 14 years of Conservative incompetence. The Conservatives weakened regulation, allowing water companies to get into debt while the sewage system crumbled and illegal sewage-dumping hit record levels.” They added: “The election of this Labour government is a reset moment for the water industry. Over the coming weeks and months, this government will outline its first steps to reform the water sector.” Plans for Thames’s nationalisation would in effect pull it on to the government’s balance sheet. Investors would be likely to face steep losses on loans made to the company. Thames Water declined to comment. A spokesperson for Ofwat declined to comment on specific briefings. They said in a statement: “Safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected, regardless of issues faced by shareholders of Thames Water. We will publish our view of its business plan for the 2025-2030 period on 11 July, along with all other water companies, as part of our PR24 proposals.

        "title": "Bank of England should keep interest rates on hold, says policymaker",
        "content": "A senior Bank of England policymaker has said Britain’s battle against inflation remains incomplete, requiring interest rates to be kept at elevated levels for longer than expected in financial markets. Pouring cold water on City predictions for a cut in rates in August, Jonathan Haskel said inflation was on course to return above the government’s 2% target. “I would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably,” said Haskel, a member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), in a speech at King’s College London on Monday. While adding there were “encouraging signs” in the battle against fast-rising prices after a drop in the headline rate of consumer price inflation to 2% in May, he warned that the return to the official target set by the government would be temporary amid pressures from a tight jobs market. “The playing out of those shocks through the economy, and the continued tight and impaired labour market, means that inflation will remain above target for quite some time,” he said. Financial markets currently estimate there is a 60% chance the Bank will cut interest rates on 1 August for the first time since the Covid pandemic. While some members of the Bank’s nine-strong MPC have pushed for a cut in official borrowing costs over recent months, Haskel has voted to keep rates on hold. The economist, who will complete his term on the MPC at the end of August, has previously expressed caution over cutting rates, as one of the more hawkish members of the rate-setting panel. The appointment of his successor will fall to the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as one of her first tasks in government. In the first speech by one of the Bank’s policymakers since the general election, Haskel said the lingering impact from soaring energy prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine had been “sufficient to impart momentum to current inflation”. UK inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. “The labour market continues to be tight, and I worry it is still impaired. I would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably,” he said. Rishi Sunak had argued before last week’s election that “difficult decisions” taken by his Conservative government had helped the economy “turn a corner”, making a pitch to the electorate that a vote for the Tories was a vote for lower interest rates. The former prime minister called the general election in May after official figures confirmed inflation had dropped to 2.3% in April, amid hopes in Tory circles that the Bank would cut interest rates in June, before the ballot. However, the central bank kept rates unchanged at 5.25% last month, having consistently warned that inflation was likely to rise later this year, amid pressure from rising prices in the service sector and resilient wage growth. Having shifted his party to the economic centre, Keir Starmer argued that Labour would bring stability to policymaking after years of turmoil under the Conservatives and boost economic growth as a result.",

        "title": "‘They can’t move on’: families of Boeing crash victims demand justice",
        "content": "Paul Kiernan struggles to talk about what happened on 10 March 2019. He walked his partner, Joanna Toole, to a taxi, put her bag in the back and kissed her goodbye. He told her he loved her, and asked her to let him know when she landed safely. The message never came. Toole’s flight, Ethiopian Airlines 302, crashed minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa killing all 157 people on board. It was the second fatal disaster involving a Boeing 737 Max jet in less than five months. On 29 October 2018, Lion Air flight 610 crashed minutes after taking off from Jakarta. All 189 people on board died. “For others, I guess they read it and see it as a business story, or something,” Kiernan said. “But for us, it’s a very personal thing.” Boeing did what beleaguered companies so often do when they want to repair a battered reputation: ousted its boss, reassured the regulators and attempted to draw a line under the matter. All the while, hundreds of families whose loved ones lost their lives awaited justice. Five years later, and even after this announcement, many feel they are still waiting. The Max disasters seemed to be fading in the public and political arena until this year, when Boeing again came under intense scrutiny after a cabin panel blew off a brand-new 737 Max, minutes after taking off from Portland, Oregon. The incident reignited questions about the aerospace giant’s management, production line and the fundamental safety of its planes. It is “the luck of God”, according to Kiernan, that a third fatal crash was avoided. As Boeing grappled with another safety crisis and scrambled to reassure alarmed regulators, furious airlines and anxious passengers, the Department of Justice (DoJ) reconsidered a controversial agreement it struck in 2021. The agreement, which was branded a “sweetheart deal” by victims’ families, protected Boeing from a criminal conspiracy charge tied to the two Max crashes – and avoided a trial – provided the planemaker overhaul its compliance program and pay $2.5bn, including compensation and a criminal fine of $243.6m. “The families felt like they were completely brushed aside and ignored by the government: the very people they trusted to do the right thing, and hold Boeing to account,” according to Erin Applebaum, attorney at Kreindler &amp; Kreindler, who represents some of those who had loved ones on board the Ethiopian flight, including Kiernan. The justice department signaled it was willing to change course in May, however, when it declared that Boeing had breached the 2021 deal. Its conclusion was welcomed by victims’ families, who demanded that the company be criminally prosecuted, after all. But when officials informed the relatives of their plan late last month, it proved another bitter blow. While Boeing will be charged with fraud, the company was offered a plea agreement by the justice department, again enabling it to avoid trial. Provided the deal is approved by the US district judge Reed O’Connor in Texas, Boeing would have to pay a fine of up to $487.2m, although this may be lowered if the judge takes account of the previous fine; spend “at least” $455m on compliance and safety programs; and work under an independent compliance monitor to scrutinize its actions for three years. “This sweetheart deal fails to recognize that because of Boeing’s conspiracy, 346 people died,” said Paul Cassell, an attorney representing some of the relatives. “Through crafty lawyering between Boeing and DoJ, the deadly consequences of Boeing’s crime are being hidden.” Under the agreement, Boeing’s board of directors would also have to meet with the grieving families of those who died. Above all, many of the victims’ relatives want accountability they feel has yet to materialize. Boeing’s public response to January’s panel blowout has only heightened their anger. Kiernan contrasted his struggle to find the words with the “practiced apology” delivered by Dave Calhoun on Capitol Hill. Before a tense Senate hearing in June, the Boeing CEO turned to relatives of the crash victims and said he was sorry for their “gut-wrenching” losses. “By the way he’s saying it, you know he doesn’t understand, or that he doesn’t mean it,” said Kiernan. A matter of minutes later, he noted, Calhoun told senators he was “proud of every action” Boeing had taken on safety. In the spring, Brian West, Boeing’s chief financial officer, described how the company had for years prioritized moving planes through factories over getting it done right. “That’s got to change,” he told a conference. “The leadership team got it in the immediate aftermath of January 5.” The comment stung Javier de Luis. “I would have thought that they would have ‘gotten it’ five years ago,” the aerospace engineer told senators in April. His sister, Graziella, was on Ethiopian flight 302. “I was just flabbergasted after I saw that quote,” Javier said. “The two crashes should have been a notice to clean house, to wipe the slate clean, to figure out how to get back to the company they used to be. It doesn’t seem to have registered five years ago, and honestly, it remains to be seen whether that registers now.” The world “should not be surprised” by Boeing’s latest crisis, he added. “We should not be surprised at the door, the mis-drilled holes, the whistleblowers. That is the result of 20 years of focusing on financial performance over safety.” A string of whistleblowers have come forward with allegations of safety and quality issues, and claims they were ignored, marginalized and even threatened for raising the alarm internally. Boeing has insisted some allegations about its 787 Dreamliner and 777 jets are “inaccurate”, and claimed employees have been emboldened in recent months to speak up with safety and quality concerns. Kiernan knows who he trusts. “Which one do I believe – all of these whistleblowers that have nothing to gain from any of this, but are stepping out and are saying that there are major problems in the company? Or do I believe this guy [Calhoun] who’s getting paid $33m, a 45% increase in his salary from last year, and that has everything to lose from this thing going wrong? Who is more likely to be lying?” The panel flew off an Alaska Airlines flight in January almost exactly three years after Boeing “promised to make all of these safety changes” as part of its first agreement with the justice department, Kiernan observed. “All of those people could have died.” Applebaum, the attorney, could scarcely believe one headline describing the justice department’s “wrenching” decision over whether to prosecute Boeing. “Do you know who has to make a wrenching decision every day? It’s these families – to make the decision to get out of bed, and keep fighting for the people they lost instead of trying to put things in the past and move on.” While January’s cabin blowout reignited media interest in Boeing, and jolted regulators into action, the relatives have been “beating this drum” for five long years, Applebaum noted. “Do you know how hard it is to relive the worst day of your life over and over and over? Every time they come to Washington, and every time they come to Texas, and every time they do an interview, they have to relive those days over again. “They have to hold pictures of the people they lost. I mean, they can’t move on while this is happening. But they’re doing it because it’s so important to them to get justice for their loved ones, and to make sure this doesn’t happen to anybody ever again.”",

        "title": "Compelling deal for Carlsberg but lacking in fizz for Britvic investors",
        "content": "What was it that Ian Durant, chairman of Britvic, the Fruit Shoot, J20 and R White’s lemonade firm, was saying about Carlsberg’s last bid at £3.1bn, or £12.50 a share? Here it is: the offer “significantly undervalues Britvic, and its current and future prospects”. What he really meant, it turns out, is that the Danes were offering close to fair value and Britvic’s board would roll over for a bump of a mere 5% in price. So it was that Carlsberg’s improvement to £13.15, or £3.3bn, was accompanied by a fine display of verbal gymnastics from the Britvic boardroom on Monday. The new bid offers “compelling” strategic logic plus the certainty of cash for shareholders, said Durant. The modestly superior new terms reflect the “the current strength and medium-term prospects”. This column would have preferred Britvic to have held out for some fizz – £14 a share, say – because the company is doing OK under its own steam. Having weathered a stay-at-home pandemic and a bout of inflation in packaging costs, recent trading has been strong and share buy-backs have been arriving regularly and confidently. Surrendering for a 36% takeover premium is nothing special in today’s undervalued (or so the fund managers keep telling us) UK stock market. Britvic’s directors would have a plea in mitigation, it should be said, and it has some weight. It is the fact that the power beyond their throne is PepsiCo. Half Britivic’s revenues come from bottling its drinks under licence – think Lipton ice tea, Tango and Pepsi itself – so what the US group wants is not irrelevant in a takeover situation. Unfortunately, PepsiCo’s thinking is that fewer and bigger global bottlers are better. As Monday’s document put it, it wants to “drive consolidation of its bottling partners across contiguous markets”. Since Carlsberg already bottles for PepsiCo in Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, it fits the bill as a pan-European bottler in the making. Indeed, Carlsberg secured PepsiCo’s blessing to move for Britvic at the outset of this saga and not simply mid-scrap as previously thought; change of control clauses will be waived. That feels tough on Britvic, whose UK relationship with PepsiCo goes back to 1987 and was extended in 2020 to 2040. Its reward for success is to be treated as a pawn in the eternal global battle between Coca-Cola (for whom Carlsberg bottles in Denmark and Finland) and PepsiCo. That’s life, sadly. From Carlsberg’s point of view, the deal does indeed make compelling sense. It is separately buying the pub chain Marston’s 40% stake in Carlsberg Marston’s, currently a UK joint venture, to get full control of the operation for £206m. So it will emerge with chunkier UK business, covering beer and soft drinks, from which it expects to squeeze £100m of annual savings eventually from combined distribution costs and so on. Even though Carlsberg will still be a distant fourth in UK brewing, its chief executive, Jacob Aarup-Andersen, can speak credibly about building a “UK powerhouse”: the UK is now the Danes’ biggest market, overtaking China, and the makeup of revenues is a model of his “beyond beer” strategy. Carlsberg looks the winner in this transaction. Britvic shareholders get only a so-so premium, reflecting a weak negotiating hand. It is not a moment to crack open the Fruit Shoots.",

        "content": "Rachel Reeves is to provide an emergency assessment of the government’s spending inheritance before MPs leave for their summer break as she attempts to pin the blame for looming tough decisions on the defeated Tories. The new chancellor used her first speech since arriving at the Treasury to insist there would be no deviation from Labour’s hardline stance on reducing the national debt despite being bequeathed the “worst set of circumstances since the second world war”. Reeves said one of her first decisions in post had been to ask officials to provide an assessment of the UK’s public spending position so that she could better understand the scale of the challenge ahead. You can read the report from the Guardian’s Larry Elliott here: Will the new Labour government receive an economic tailwind from the Bank of England? If Jonathan Haskel had his way, monetary support for the economy would come later rather than sooner. Haskel, an outgoing member of the monetary policy committee, said that he would rather hold rates for longer – rather than cutting them – to ensure that inflationary pressures have properly dissipated.

The effective ban on onshore windfarms was today dropped by the Labour government, in news that has delighted environmental and energy experts. The ban was caused by two footnotes to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), the rules which govern the building of homes and infrastructure. These footnotes applied only to onshore wind, no other type of infrastructure, and required such strong proof that there was no opposition locally that they made building turbines impossible, given there is nearly always some local resistance to any building proposal. In Labour’s proposed new NPPF, these footnotes have been deleted in their entirety, meaning that onshore wind projects are now on an even footing with all other forms of infrastructure. The change will officially come into force when parliament resumes on 18 July. You can read the full story here: The Labour government’s plans to boost growth – including chancellor Rachel Reeves’s plans to push through new building projects – could make things a lot easier if they pay off, Fitch said. In its update on the UK following the election, Fitch wrote: Labour plans to boost growth through a combination of public and private investment supported by improved stability and ambitious reform to parts of the economy, such as the planning system. Faster growth would somewhat ease the policy trade-offs needed to ensure public finance sustainability. The UK’s economic prospects this year have improved after the general election, according to Fitch Ratings, an influential credit rating agency. The Labour party’s commitment to debt reduction means the entry of a new government under Keir Starmer “will not lead to an immediate shift in fiscal strategy”. In March Fitch upgraded the outlook on the UK’s AA- rating from “negative” to “stable” after the chaos of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s “mini-budget”. The election result will mean more “near-term political stability”, Fitch said on Monday. Views on the sustainability or otherwise of sovereign debts are somewhat subjective, but Fitch – along with rivals S&amp;P Global and Moody’s – still retain power as some investors take into account ratings when deciding on investments. Fitch said that Labour could struggle to stick to the path of “fiscal consolidation” – reducing debt. We still view implementing this projected consolidation as politically challenging, notwithstanding the margin of Labour’s election victory, as it would involve real cuts in unprotected spending and investment that would likely further strain public services. Metro Bank is reportedly trying to sell a chunk of mortgages as it tries to turn its fortunes around after a rescue deal. The high street lender is working with investment bank Morgan Stanley on a process to raise capital from the sale of the mortgages, and could make between £3bn and £4bn, Sky News reported, citing sources. Metro was co-founded by the US billionaire Vernon Hill and became the UK’s first new high street lender in 150 years when it launched in 2010. It reached a £925m rescue package in October led by the Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski Bacal, who took a 53% stake in Metro as a result of the deal. Since then it has cut 1,000 workers and stopped opening seven days a week as it tries to clamp down on costs. Haskel says that inflation can become sticky at higher rates if the labour market is “impaired” – meaning it is harder to match unemployed people to vacancies. He worries that the economy is still impaired, meaning the Bank of England will have to respond with relatively tighter monetary policy in order to get inflation sustainably down to its 2% target. UK inflation hit 2% in May for the first time since July 2021. The labour market continues to be tight, and I worry it is still impaired. I would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably. Jonathan Haskel has come out strongly against the “greedflation” narrative, that businesses were pushing up inflation by increasing profits. That runs counter to analysis by some economists, including at the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and thinktanks such as the IPPR and the Common Wealth. Haskel said: While there may be variation across firms, products and industries, there is no evidence for this in aggregate in the UK, at least that I can discern in official data. The level of corporate profits has increased, but so too has the level of wages and the level of prices. As a share of total national income, profits have remained largely the same. Jonathan Haskel has served on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee for six years. As he comes to the end of his second and final term, he appears to be less concerned about showing his hand. He argues in his speech that the Bank was right to raise interest rates in 2021 to stop inflationary pressures from building up further during the global supply chain chaos caused by coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. He said: High inflation, no matter what the cause, risks becoming embedded if it persists for too long. And he thinks that some of those pressures remain in the UK, even as some of the massive price increases caused by the energy crisis after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have faded. Underlying inflation is persistent and declining more slowly, with headline inflation pushed around by volatile energy and base effects. The Bank of England should hold interest rates steady rather than cutting to ensure inflationary pressures have subsided, according to a member of the monetary policy committee (MPC). Jonathan Haskel, professor of economics at Imperial College and an external member of the rate-setting MPC, said that despite “encouraging signs” on falling inflation, “I would rather hold rates”. In a speech at King’s College London, he said: There are considerable encouraging signs, most notably from normalising inflation expectations and a (spoiler: temporary) return of headline inflation to target in May 2024. However, the wage-price system in the UK has been subject to a sequence of enormous shocks over recent years. The playing out of those shocks through the economy, and the continued tight and impaired labour market, means that inflation will remain above target for quite some time. I would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably. Shares in London-listed insurer Hiscox have jumped 14% after reports that two rivals were considering takeover bids. Japan’s Sompo and Italy’s Generali are interested in a possible buyout, according to industry publication Insurance Insider. Hiscox was valued at £3.8bn at the end of last week – meaning Monday’s share price move has added half a billion pounds to its market value. If it retains that valuation – or indeed if a takeover bid comes through – then it could be enough to push the company back into the FTSE 100 index. Hiscox is one of the biggest members of the FTSE 250 index, having previously entered the FTSE 100. Boeing will plead guilty to a criminal fraud charge stemming from two deadly crashes of 737 Max jetliners, after the government determined the company violated an agreement that had protected it from prosecution for more than three years, the US the government said in court filing late on Sunday. Federal prosecutors gave Boeing the choice this week of entering a guilty plea and paying a fine as part of its sentence, or facing a trial on the felony criminal charge of conspiracy to defraud the US. The plea deal, which still must receive the approval of a federal judge to take effect, calls for Boeing to pay an additional $243.6m fine, according to a justice department (DOJ) document filed in federal court in Texas. Boeing has also agreed to invest at least $455m over the next three years to strengthen its safety and compliance programs, the DOJ said. The department will appoint a third-party monitor to oversee the firm’s compliance. The monitor will have to publicly file with the court annual reports on the company’s progress. A guilty plea potentially threatens the company’s ability to secure lucrative government contracts with the likes of the US defence department and Nasa, although it could seek waivers. Boeing became exposed to criminal prosecution after the justice department in May found the company violated a 2021 settlement involving the fatal crashes. You can read the full story here: Rachel Reeves has said that the government has no intention of changing the way that the Bank of England treats reserve remuneration. That idea has been floated by various economists and commentators – and even made its way into the Reform UK manifesto. It would mean the Bank of England paying a lower rate of interest to commercial banks. However, Reeves has now ruled it out pretty firmly. You can follow more from Reeves’s speech on our politics live blog here: Rachel Reeves has pledged to “get Britain building again” after saying the government will introduce mandatory housing targets in her first major speech as UK chancellor. Local authorities will retain the power to decide on planning applications “in the first instance”, but can be overruled nationally if they fail to meet their targets. “The answer cannot always be ‘no’,” said Reeves, who is the first woman to be chancellor in the UK. Reeves said it was not a “green light” for any type of home, but that Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister as well as housing secretary, will push for more building. Rayner has already called in decisions blocking two data centres. Reeves said: The deputy prime minister will take an interventionist approach to make sure we’ve got the housing that we need. Housebuilders will also be an important part of the government’s plans. Reeves said: “We need the private sector to build homes.” Reeves claimed the new Labour government has done “more in 72 hours than last government did in 14 years” to fix the planning system. There is no time to waste. We will end the prevarication, and make the necessary choices to fix the foundations. Reeves also said that the government will look at encouraging pension funds to invest in UK companies. The French elections have given investors pause across Europe, according to a newly published poll. The Sentix investor poll slipped to -7.3 points, its lowest point since March. That ended a run of eight consecutive improvements in investors’ perceptions of the eurozone economy. Patrick Hussy, Sentix’s managing director, said: The recent recovery of the European economy has come to an abrupt end. The moderate economic momentum in Germany is also faltering again. The positive mood due to the European Football Championship 2024 is not spilling over into the economy. The already gloomy assessment of the situation deteriorated to -32.3 points, while expectations fell to -4.8 points below the April value. The French elections are contributing to the growing concern, as is the increasing slowdown in the US economy. The family behind Paramount, one of Hollywood’s most iconic companies, has agreed to sell the business to the independent company Skydance. Paramount chair Shari Redstone, whose father, Sumner, bought the company in 1994, has now given the greenlight to the sale of the family’s controlling stake in company which produced classic films such as The Godfather, Titanic and Chinatown. Paramount also owns the television network CBS and channels such as MTV and Nickelodeon. The deal, which values the company at $28bn (£22bn), brings an end to more than six months of negotiations. It will see Skydance and Paramount merge, with Skydance agreeing to invest $8bn into the new company. Skydance will then pay a further $2.4bn to buy National Amusements, the Redstone-owned theatre movie operator which holds nearly 80% of voting shares in Paramount. The agreement comes just four years after the death of Sumner Redstone, whose company Viacom bought Paramount Pictures three decades ago in a deal worth $10bn. Shari took over after his passing but has seen it struggle in recent years with the value of its shares falling by more than 75% in the last five years. What are the prospects for a government in France? Don’t hold your breath for big changes to spending plans any time soon. That is the verdict of Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy. French bonds and the euro initially sold off after the result came, but they are now flat. That is “the right call”, said Vistesen, given the small probability of movement for a while as complex negotiations start. Vistesen wrote: Grand coalitions, like for example in Germany, are not the norm in France, but that could be the only solution this time around, given the fragmented parliament. The conditions for a minority government to rule, meanwhile, is that it does not face a blocking majority. As an initial base case, we have to assume that the left will attempt to capitalise on its victory to pull any government as far left as possible on economic policy. This, in turn, would increase the risk of a standoff with the EU over fiscal policy. This is why the Euro and French bonds initially sold off in response to the result. They’re now both virtually unchanged on the day, however, which is the right call. A lot of negotiation lies ahead before we see the new government, let alone what it can and can’t do. The French election has meant that Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN) will not be in power, but it has not settled what France’s new government will look like. The New Popular Front (NFP), the hastily arranged coalition of left-wing parties, won the most seats, but it is far short of a parliamentary majority. The result will mean a lot of negotiation to agree on who will be the new prime minister – let alone on achieving anything meaningful in governing the country. It means there are some complicated scenarios to weigh up, although for financial markets it also means the likelihood of a major political shift – and with it major spending decisions is put off. That may explain the muted market reaction. Philippe Ledent, a senior economist at ING, an investment bank, said the result “plunges France further into the unknown”. The French parliament is more divided than ever, made up mainly of three blocs (Left – 182 seats, Centre – 168 seats, Extreme Right – 143 seats) and a number of smaller ones. As we predicted before the elections, no bloc can claim an absolute majority. Ledent sketches out two options: Minority government French political parties “are not used to making concessions in order to create a programme around a coalition with other parties”, and the NFP’s most prominent figure, Jean-Luc Mélenchon demanded its entire programme be implemented. “If political parties maintain such positions, a long period of instability will ensue,” said Ledent. “Without an absolute majority, and given the radical nature of its socioeconomic programme, the left-wing bloc won’t be able to pass a single law, unless it uses the tool (article 49.3 to force legislation) that it decried so much itself during the previous legislature. A motion of censure would probably be tabled very quickly, bringing down the government.” It is a similar situation if Macron tries to install a prime minister from his own bloc, or even from the right. Instability would last until at least June 2025, since the president cannot call for new elections before then. Learning to cooperate “Excluding the 80 MPs from the far left and the 145 from the far right, there are over 350 MPs left to form a broad coalition ready to reform France, taking into account the diversity of opinions. In other European countries, including Germany, such a configuration would be quite natural and would result in a government with a clear majority. “Certainly, some doors are beginning to open for such a coalition. Of course, the President’s camp is in favour.” “The French political parties are stuck in a strategic game where the only solution is for the parties to work together. It would help restore calm and political stability. But, not knowing what attitude the other parties will adopt and because any concession on its programme would be seen as a betrayal of its electorate, no party seems willing to enter into discussions in the very short term.” After an initial drop, France’s benchmark Cac 40 index has also swivelled into positive territory. Shares in Paris are up by 0.36%. Investors often favour political stalemates, as they can reduce the scope for policies that will markedly change a country’s fiscal position. The FTSE 100 has now edged into the black for today: it is up by 0.02%. B&amp;M European Value Retail, the owner of B&amp;M Bargains, is the biggest riser, up 2.1%. Shares in pub company Marston’s have surged by 20% after it agreed for Carlsberg to buy out its part of a brewing joint venture for £206m. The deal means that Marston’s will abandon its roots as a brewer – previously known as Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries – stretching back to 1875. Carlsberg will take complete control of ales including Hobgoblin, Brakspear, Pedigree and Wainwright. Marston’s first gave up 60% of the brewing business to Carlsberg in 2020, part of a broader consolidation in the brewing industry that saw the biggest brewers take over smaller companies. The latest deal, a buyout of the remaining 40% of the joint venture, means Marston’s will be left running its estate of about 1,370 pubs. The pubs are mainly located in suburbs around the UK. Marston’s said the deal would cut its annual interest bill by £18m. Justin Platt, Marston’s chief executive, said: Our core capability and key opportunity to unlock value for shareholders is in driving a focused and successful pub business. This deal further strengthens our balance sheet, significantly reducing our debt by over £200m. In addition, CMBC remain valued strategic partners and we continue to benefit from our ongoing long-term brand distribution agreement with them. Crucially, it allows us to become a pure play hospitality business and focus on what we do best – namely, giving our guests amazing pub experiences. The FTSE 100 in London has also dipped in the opening trades. It was down by 0.3%. That appeared to have been driven partly by a drop in gold and silver prices, which weighed on mining company stocks. The top five fallers were the mining contingent: Anglo American, Endeavour Mining, Rio Tinto, Antofagasta and Glencore. They were all down by between 0.9% and 1.5%. Elsewhere Germany’s Dax index was down 0.1%, Spain’s Ibex was down 0.2%, and the Euro Stoxx index dropped 0.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. France’s left-wing coalition came first in the second round of its parliamentary election in a shock result that keeps the far-right out of power. Investors are bracing for uncertainty as they wait to see whether the left can work with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Together alliance. France’s benchmark stock index, the Cac 40, dropped by 0.5% in the opening trades on Monday morning. The euro dipped as currency markets opened on Sunday evening, dropping as low as $1.08 against the US dollar. However, it recovered most of its losses on Monday morning as investors weighted up the prospect of a period of political gridlock as the left-wing New Popular Front tries to work with Together. France’s Cac 40 stock market index was due to drop by 0.6% when stock markets open on Monday morning. Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, an investment bank, said the election would spell the end for Macron’s investor-friendly reforms. He said: The political forces that joined forces to prevent an RN government have little else in common. Their views on migration, social and cultural issues, fiscal policy and the need for pro-growth reforms are often diametrically opposed. Forming a government will not be easy. Times are tough, emotions are running high – and France has no tradition of forging coalitions between parties of very different political persuasions. Britvic agrees to sweetened Carlsberg offer On UK stock markets, FTSE 250 drinks maker Britvic has agreed to a takeover by Danish brewer Carlsberg after a sweetened deal valued the Fruit Shoot maker at £3.3bn. Britvic shareholders will be entitled to receive £13.15 per share, versus a close of £12.10 on Friday and 36% above the £9.70 price on 19 June, when news of the takeover got out. The company, which also makes the J2O juice drink and Robinson’s squash, had initially rejected a £3.1bn offer on 21 June. Britvic’s directors will unanimously vote in favour of the acquisition, the company said on Monday morning in a statement to the stock market. It will be only the latest in a series of foreign takeovers of prominent British companies. Carlsberg’s executives and bankers have been busy: they have also bought out the share of UK company Marston’s in a brewery joint venture. More details of that deal to come.",

        "title": "Boeing will plead guilty to criminal fraud over 737 Max crashes",
        "content": "Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a US criminal fraud charge stemming from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners, angering the families of the hundreds of passengers killed who had wanted the case to go to trial. Federal prosecutors had found that the American aircraft manufacturer was in violation of a 2021 agreement struck after the crashes, which had protected it from prosecution for more than three years. Last week they gave Boeing the choice of entering a guilty plea and paying a fine as part of its sentence or facing a trial on the felony criminal charge of conspiracy to defraud the US over the crashes, which claimed 346 lives. Under the new plea deal, which must receive the approval of a federal judge to take effect, Boeing will pay a $243.6m (£190m) fine, according to a justice department (DoJ) document filed in federal court in Texas. The company has also agreed to invest at least $455m over the next three years to strengthen its safety and compliance programmes, the department said. In October 2018, 189 people were killed when Lion Air flight 610 fell into the Java Sea off Indonesia. In March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed shortly after take off from Addis Ababa airport, claiming 157 lives. In 2021, federal prosecutors alleged that Boeing committed conspiracy to defraud the government by misleading regulators about a flight-control system that was implicated in the crashes. However, they agreed not to prosecute if the company paid a penalty and successfully completed a three-year period of increased monitoring and reporting. However, in January a panel blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight, forcing it to land. Although nobody was hurt, scrutiny on Boeing’s safety record ramped up again and in May the Department of Justice found it had violated the 2021 deal, reopening the prospect of prosecution. Relatives of the Max crash victims were briefed on the agreement a week ago and labelled it a “sweetheart plea deal” that spared Boeing the scrutiny of a criminal trial. They objected in a filing, saying the deal “unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive, and fails to hold Boeing accountable for the deaths … the generous plea agreement rests on deceptive and offensive premises”. Paul Cassell, who represents 15 victims’ families, said the deal was “clearly not in the public interest” and appealed to the judge to “reject this inappropriate plea and simply set the matter for a public trial”. Sanjiv Singh, counsel for 16 families of crash victims, said: “This was a sweetheart deal, and so Boeing accepting it is par for the course. Now the fight – and there will be one – under relevant statutes and rules of criminal procedure.” The families also expressed frustration about the size of the financial penalty. “Without a hefty fine, there will be zero safety impact at Boeing,” Erin Applebaum, another attorney acting for relatives, said last week. “The fine should have been in the billions, not the millions.” The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the objection. In its filing to the court regarding the proposed plea deal, it claimed that it had given the families “numerous opportunities” to express their views and they had “meaningfully and substantially” taken part in several conferral meetings. Families were particularly angered when informed late last month that Boeing would be able to appoint its own corporate monitor to oversee the company. The plea agreement addresses this specific concern, stating that the government will appoint the monitor. A guilty plea potentially threatens Boeing’s ability to secure lucrative government contracts with the likes of the US defence department and Nasa, although it could seek waivers. However, it also makes it easier for the company, which will have a new CEO later this year, to move forward as it seeks approval for its planned acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems. The deal does not give Boeing immunity for other incidents, including January’s cabin panel blowout. “While many of us would have preferred a more vigorous prosecution, a guilty plea to a felony is a serious step up in accountability from the initial deferred prosecution agreement,” said Mark Lindquist, an attorney representing a family of an Ethiopian crash victim and 31 passengers from the Alaskan Airlines flight. The deal also does not cover any current or former Boeing officials, only the corporation. A Boeing spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the justice department, subject to the memorialisation and approval of specific terms.”",

        "title": "Keir Starmer urged to act on water bill rises in England and Wales",
        "content": "Trade unions, celebrities and river activists are calling on the new UK government to halt attempts by the water industry to raise customer bills in England and Wales by up to 91% and immediately start a root-and-branch review of water ownership. The author Michael Rosen and comedians Nish Kumar and Stephen Fry joined campaigners from Greenpeace, Surfers Against Sewage, River Action, the Rivers Trust and activists across the country in signing a letter to Keir Starmer urging him to step in, days before the regulator Ofwat is to announce whether it will approve huge increases in customer bills across England and Wales. Some of the most polluting and financially struggling water companies, including Thames Water and Southern Water, are seeking the biggest increases in bills. Thames Water wants customer bills to rise by 59% after accounting for inflation. Southern is seeking to raise bills by 91% by 2030, to £915 a year. The letter, organised by the campaign group We Own It, was also signed by the GMB and Unite unions. It says: “Saturday marked 35 years since the Water Act 1989 established our current model of water and sewage management, including privatisation and top-down regulation. “Bills have risen at twice the rate of inflation. No new drinking reservoirs have been delivered. A quarter of our supply leaks out of our pipes. Debts are unpaid; plans ‘uninvestable’. And last year, operators released sewage for over 3m hours into our rivers and seas. “If the current failed model remains in place, Labour could be fighting the next election with some bills topping £915 a year and sewage a greater threat to our health than ever.” The letter calls on the prime minister to pause the current price-setting process and start a root-and-branch public review of ownership and regulation immediately, including consultation with water campaigners, trade union representatives and customers. Water companies are promising their biggest ever investment of £100bn to fix ageing infrastructure, cut sewage discharges and build new reservoirs, 35 years after the sector was privatised. They are acting after a public outcry over sewage pollution in rivers and seas, and a decline in the state of English rivers to a situation in which no river is deemed to be in good health. As well as concern over river health, there are growing fears about the threat to public health from the way wastewater is treated in England. The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, has said public health must be central to future investment in a new wastewater system to protect people from waterborne diseases from contact with rivers and coastal waters polluted by treated and untreated sewage. The regulator Ofwat, which is itself under pressure for allowing companies to pay dividends of £78bn in the past three decades while building debts of £60bn, will on Thursday announce whether it approves the business plans of the main water and sewerage companies. The Ofwat decision, which was delayed until 11 July because of the general election, comes amid a growing crisis in the water sector. Thames Water, the biggest privatised water monopoly, is struggling to stay afloat with debts of almost £15bn, and investors are threatening to pull the plug on the company. Ofwat has flagged concerns over the financial resilience of other privatised companies, including Southern Water, SES Water and South East Water, as of the highest concern. The financial resilience of Yorkshire Water and Portsmouth Water is also of concern by the regulator. “No other country in the world runs water and sewage in the way we do: 90% is publicly owned and delivered,” the letter to Starmer says. “Regulation has been flawed, captured, and underfunded: a constant threat of the current model. Accountability must be reviewed, including putting community representatives on company boards and using ‘sunshine regulation’ to deliver greater transparency.”",

        "content": "The UK soft drinks maker Britvic has agreed to an improved £3.3bn takeover offer from the Danish brewer Carlsberg. Britvic, whose brands include J20, Robinsons and R White’s lemonade, accepted the £13.15 a share offer after rejecting previous takeover offers from Carlsberg on the grounds that they undervalued the company. In a statement to the stock exchange on Monday, Carlsberg said Britvic’s board would unanimously recommend the deal, which comprises £12.90 in cash for each Britvic share and a special dividend payment of 25p for each share. The deal would create a new enlarged group named Carlsberg Britvic. Britvic shares rose 4.5% on Monday to £12.65, making it one of the top risers on the FTSE 250. The deal will need the backing of 75% of Britvic investors in a shareholder vote. Britvic was founded in the UK in the 1930s as the British Vitamin Products Company and used soft drinks as an affordable way of supplying vitamins to consumers. It has 39 brands in 100 countries including Brazil, France and Ireland. It also has an exclusive licence with PepsiCo in Great Britain and Ireland to make and sell Pepsi Max, 7UP, Rockstar Energy and Lipton Ice Tea. As part of the deal, Carlsberg has secured agreement from Pepsico to waive a clause in its bottling contract with Britvic that would have allowed it to cancel the arrangement on the event of a change of ownership. Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said: “With this transaction, we are combining Britvic’s high-quality soft drinks portfolio with Carlsberg’s strong beer portfolio and route-to-market capabilities, creating an enhanced proposition across the UK and markets in western Europe.” Carlsberg has said the acquisition would create annual cost savings of about £100m over five years, including through procurement and supply chain efficiencies as well as economies in administration and overheads. Ian Durant, the Britvic non-executive chair, said: “The proposed transaction creates an enlarged international group that is well-placed to capture the growth opportunities in multiple drinks sectors. “Crucially, to remain competitive at a time when the market is being shaped by the trend of increasing consolidation among bottling partners, Carlsberg’s agreement with PepsiCo provides the combined group with a strong platform for continued success.” Carlsberg also announced on Monday that it had separately agreed a deal to acquire Marston’s minority stake in Carlsberg Marston’s, the company’s brewing business in the UK, which is now the fourth biggest beer company in the country. It said that Marston’s would remain an important partner for the new enlarged business and its long-term drinks supply and distribution agreement would remain in place. The deal means that Marston’s will abandon its roots as a brewer – previously known as Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries – stretching back to 1875. Carlsberg will take complete control of ales including Hobgoblin, Brakspear, Pedigree and Wainwright.",

        "content": "The long-established Pontins has been rated the worst UK holiday park brand in a survey by the consumer organisation Which?, with smaller and independent resorts taking the top honours. Top of the table was Potters Resorts, which has a base in the Essex countryside and another on the Norfolk coast. Which? surveyed more than 1,700 people about their experiences at UK holiday parks in the past two years, asking them to rate their stays on 11 criteria, including quality of accommodation, cleanliness, facilities and activities, and value for money. Founded by Fred Pontin in 1946, Pontins was taken over in 2011 by the Britannia Hotels chain. In the past nine months or so three sites – Camber Sands in East Sussex, Prestatyn in north Wales and Southport – have suddenly closed, and it now has just two currently open: Pakefield in Suffolk and Sand Bay in Somerset. Pontins earned a run of two-star ratings in categories including customer service, quality of accommodation, cleanliness, quality of facilities and activities, food and drink and value for money. Its highest scores of three stars were for communication and the quality of entertainment. While the brand took last place with a customer score of 56% – it also came bottom in 2022 – it was far from the only big name that “failed to live up to expectations”, said Which? Butlin’s – which has resorts in Bognor Regis in West Sussex, Minehead, Somerset, and Skegness, Lincolnshire – came fifth from bottom with a customer score of 67%, with guests underwhelmed by the customer service on offer and the food and drink, said the consumer organisation. However, the brand, famous for its Redcoats, scored four stars for the quality of entertainment and the quality and variety of children’s activities. Just above Butlin’s in the table, Center Parcs and Haven tied with a customer score of 69%. The most-visited brand in the survey, Center Parcs – which has five UK locations – received largely favourable reviews “but ultimately failed to deliver on value for money, receiving just two stars in this category,” said Which? Potters Resorts took the top spot with a customer score of 87%, followed by Which? “recommended provider” Forest Holidays with a score of 80%. Potters Resorts has a base a short drive from Colchester in Essex, and another a few miles from Great Yarmouth. Naomi Leach, deputy editor of Which? Travel, said: “Our latest survey shows that it’s worth looking beyond the best-known names, with smaller and independent resorts offering excellent value for money, great customer service and plenty of onsite entertainment.” Pontins has been approached for comment. Which? said Pontins did not respond to its requests for comment. A Butlin’s spokesperson said it had invested more than £50m across its three resorts and was pleased to see that it was scoring highly on activities and entertainment. “It is disappointing to see that some scores are lower, but we would like to reassure guests that we’re investing in these areas to offer a better holiday experience.” A spokesperson for Center Parcs said it was proud of its “consistently high” guest satisfaction scores, and that more than 60% of guests go on to make another booking with it. They added: “Our guests demand a high-quality experience, and each year we invest tens of millions of pounds improving our villages.”",

        "title": "Largest UK public sector trial of four-day week sees huge benefits, research finds",
        "content": "In the largest public sector trial of the four-day week in Britain, fewer refuse collectors quit and there were faster planning decisions, more rapid benefits processing and quicker call answering, independent research has found. South Cambridgeshire district council’s controversial experiment with a shorter working week resulted in improvements in performance in 11 out of 24 areas, little or no change in 11 areas and worsening of performance in two areas, according to analysis of productivity before and during the 15-month trial by academics at the universities of Cambridge and Salford. The trial by the Liberal Democrat-controlled authority drew a furious reaction from the Conservative government, with a minister telling the borough leader, Bridget Smith, to “end your experiment immediately”, complaining that it would not give value for money for local taxpayers. The Tory former local MP, Anthony Browne, who was defeated by a Liberal Democrat in last week’s general election, had attacked the trial as “an ideological crusade”. The multi-year study of the trial involving about 450 desk staff plus refuse collectors found: Staff turnover fell by 39%, helping save £371,500 in a year, mostly on agency staff costs. Regular household planning applications were decided about a week and a half earlier. Approximately 15% more major planning application decisions were completed within the correct timescale, compared with before. The time taken to process changes to housing benefit and council tax benefit claims fell. On the downside, rent collection for council housing worsened slightly, although this was attributed to the cost of living crisis. The speed with which empty council houses were relet fell slightly, from 28 to 30 days on average. The results were adjusted for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Joe Ryle, the director of the 4 Day Week Campaign said the results heralded “a huge opportunity for councils and organisations across the public sector to start planning for a four-day working week”. The new Labour government is expected to push the NHS to work longer hours to reduce waiting lists, with more operations at weekends, and is preparing to speed up the planning process to boost housebuilding. Productivity has flatlined in the British economy since the pandemic after historically rising at about 2% annually. In 2019, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn included plans to cut the working week to 32 hours with no loss of pay in its manifesto, but this year the party said nothing about enabling a four-day week in its latest promises. It has pledged to deliver economic growth and productivity growth across the economy to enable greater spending on public services without raising income tax, national insurance and VAT. Employers everywhere from Sweden to the United Arab Emirates and New Zealand to the US have experimented with the four-day week. But last week the government of Greece announced a new six-day week policy for private companies aimed at boosting the economy amid a shrinking population and shortage of skilled workers. It is seeking longer hours from workers to turbocharge productivity. Under the South Cambridgeshire trial, which began in January 2023 and ran to April 2024, staff were expected to carry out 100% of their work in 80% of the time for 100% of the pay. The full trial cut staff turnover by 39% and scores for employees’ physical and mental health, motivation and commitment all improved, the study showed. “Coupled with the hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayer money that we have saved, improved recruitment and retention and positives around health and wellbeing, this brave and pioneering trial has clearly been a success,” said John Williams, the lead council member for resources. “We know we cannot compete on salary alone and have needed to find bold new ways of tackling our recruitment and retention issues.” Mike Davey, the leader of Cambridge city council, which shares planning services with South Cambridgeshire, described the trial as “a win-win-win situation, with improved service delivery for residents, reduced staffing costs for the council, and a better work-life balance for council staff.” Scores of private companies have already adopted the approach, with many finding it helps staff retention. Ryle said the South Cambridgeshire results “prove once and for all that a four-day week with no loss of pay absolutely can succeed in a local government setting”.",

        "content": "The UK will press for “job guarantees” in return for taxpayer-funded investment during talks with the Indian-owned Tata Steel about the future of its flagship Port Talbot site. The new business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said he believed there was a “better deal available” for the south Wales site and the steel industry as a whole, as he confirmed on Sunday that negotiations with Tata were continuing. His comments follow the steelworks’ future becoming a general election issue, after Labour and the Conservatives developed competing responses to Tata’s rejection of a trade union plan to keep Port Talbot’s blast furnaces running. The company outlined in January that it could no longer afford to continue production at the loss-making Port Talbot plant – which it said was losing it £1m a day – while it completed a four-year transition plan towards greener production. Tata and the former Conservative government agreed a deal last year where the company would receive £500m in state subsidies to help with the move to new “greener” furnaces, which could cut UK emissions by about 2% if renewable electricity was used. However, the deal also involved closing the blast furnaces, putting 2,800 jobs at risk and potentially leaving the UK as the only big economy unable to make steel from scratch. “There is a better deal available for Port Talbot and the steel industry as a whole,” Reynolds told BBC1’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg. “There is more money available for the steel industry under our plans for government … But that’s about making sure we meet this transition with the private sector together … it is a good exemplar of how we have to make sure decarbonisation is not deindustrialisation, and we’ve got to do that together.” The minister added: “I’m going to make sure that job guarantees are part of the negotiation that we’re having.” Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, told the same programme: “There’s no doubt that Labour coming in and the intent of what they want to do is a good thing.” She added: “My main focus is jobs, pay and conditions for workers, so I’m going to either be seen as a critical friend or a pain in the proverbial … it’s my job to make sure feet to the fire on this.” Labour has committed to provide £2.5bn to “rebuild our steel industry”, with Reynolds noting this was “on top of” the £500m committed by the previous government. Tata has said it would make every effort to mitigate the impact of the transformation on affected employees and the local community, adding that it had put forward the most favourable financial package of support it had ever offered. In a separate interview, Reynolds said the online fashion retailer Shein would be expected to meet “ethical and moral targets” on tax and all aspects of business if it listed on the London Stock Exchange. He told Times Radio that he was “concerned” about a “loophole” that allowed firms to avoid import duties by shipping small packages directly to customers, and that he would want to discuss the issue with the company, which was founded in China.",

Martin Seidenberg, the chief executive of International Distribution Services, plans “the biggest network change in 20 years” to revamp Royal Mail’s deliveries despite uncertainty created by the Czech energy tycoon Daniel Kretinsky’s takeover, which has been backed by the board. As part of the overhaul, Royal Mail is halving its daily chartered flights transporting post around the UK to 18 in an effort to reduce costs and cut its carbon emissions. The company cut the first 11 flights last week and will end another three on 20 July and a further four in early 2025. The move, an element of Seidenberg’s strategy after his arrival last year, represents its biggest ever reduction of domestic airmail, saving 30,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year by shifting the post on to the roads and cutting 1.2m air miles. It hopes to hit net zero by 2040. Seidenberg told the Guardian: “The flights are part of the wider transformation agenda. Take aside the bid situation – we had a couple of weeks where we had to focus on that one – the organisation continues to focus on transformation.” Royal Mail shifted the mail from the air to roads in part through an overhaul that has included later shift times of up to 90 minutes in delivery offices, meaning it can move mail by road over longer journey times and still meet next-day delivery targets. “We have more time to push the mail through the network by road, enabling us to take the flights out,” said Seidenberg, adding that the change meant some customers such as online retailers could now hand over parcels as late as 1am for delivery that day. The flights cut include routes from Stansted to Belfast and Edinburgh, and Inverness to Edinburgh and East Midlands airport (EMA). The 18 flights remaining include journeys between EMA and Belfast and Edinburgh, and Glasgow and the Scottish islands, with flights typically running between 7pm and 4am. The 508-year-old company first moved mail by air on passenger services from the south-east of England to Scotland and Northern Ireland in the 1960s, but found their schedules limiting. In 1979 it established a small hub for chartered flights in Speke, Liverpool, rapidly growing from moving 600 postbags to 6,000 daily in just two years. In 1992 a second hub at EMA was established, with 15 planes carrying 5,000 bags a night. A dedicated network, Skynet, was established the same year, connecting a matrix of hubs around the UK to allow mail to be moved on fewer, larger aircraft. By 2003 the company had ditched some air services as part of a £90m cost-cutting drive, and three years later operations were closed at Liverpool and Gatwick. A later move to limit road speeds of heavy vehicles pushed some mail volumes back into the air. During the pandemic the company began trials of delivering by drone to remote corners of the UK, including the Isles of Scilly and the Shetland Islands. But Seidenberg cautioned that regulations around the technology and its limited capacity meant widespread use of drones remained impractical for a “mass production business”. Kretinsky’s EP Group, which is IDS’s largest shareholder, has offered 370p a share to take over the group, an improvement on an initial 320p bid. Seidenberg, who is in line to land more than £5m if the takeover completes, declined to comment in detail on the deal but said Royal Mail would benefit from potential investment by EP Group. He said: “The increase of the price paid a share, which is 73% to where it was before the bid, is quite outstanding. And we do need to realise that this company is still in transformation. We’re making good progress, but also we need to understand the change hasn’t happened yet. “This company still needs investment going forward. We’ve started with the Parcelshops and parcel lockers, but increasing those networks will require investment. Transformation is always a risk. It’s a business risk.”",

        "title": "Of the economy’s two possible endings the happy one is more likely | Larry Elliott",
        "content": "Just as in the movie Sliding Doors, there are two endings to the story that began on Thursday with Labour’s victory in the 2024 election. One is happy, one is sad, and either is possible. What happens to the economy over the next five years will determine which one materialises. Let’s start with the happy ending: the one where the credits roll as Keir Starmer wins big for a second time in 2029. The script for that one starts slowly. The scale of Labour’s win means it doesn’t have to rush things but has time to put in place the supply-side reforms, such as changes to planning rules, that will boost growth. Structural changes don’t bear fruit overnight but by the early 2030s it should be possible to notice the difference. In the meantime the economy will benefit from a much-needed period of stability. Business investment was depressed during the period when there was uncertainty over whether the UK would leave the EU or not. It suffered another hit during the pandemic, and a third after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A chaotic period in which the UK had three prime ministers and five chancellors in a single parliament is now over. The poor showing of the SNP in the general election means the prospects of a second referendum on Scottish independence in the next five years are much diminished. Likewise, Starmer is unlikely to reconsider his decision to rule out rejoining the EU (or even the single market) with Reform UK breathing down Labour’s neck in so many seats. As things stand, Britain looks a safer place for investment than France or Germany. Much has been said about Labour’s baleful economic inheritance, but growth is set to surprise on the upside in the coming months. Consumer spending power has been boosted in recent months because wages have been rising more rapidly than prices, but there tends to be a lag before households realise they are better off. The election result will be the catalyst for higher consumer spending, and it will also prompt businesses to give the go-ahead for investment decisions put on hold in recent months. The boost to growth will provide Rachel Reeves with a bit more scope in her autumn budget. She may also be tempted to make changes to the government’s debt rules, which would provide her with some additional wriggle room. It won’t be a massive windfall, and the new chancellor says money will be tight. But she might have an extra £20bn to spend on public services. Starmer and Reeves won’t need to rush because the Tories will spend the post-election period at war with each other over the future direction of the party rather than in opposing what Labour is doing. One big problem for Rishi Sunak in his period as prime minister was that the economic and political cycles became misaligned, with tough decisions, such as the freeze on tax allowances and thresholds, biting in the last years of the parliament. The prospects of a second Labour victory will be much enhanced if Reeves gets the unpopular stuff out of the way early and then lets up as the next election approaches. The alternative ending is not nearly so cheerful. The gentle recovery in the economy runs out of steam as stubbornly high inflation in the service sector deters the Bank of England from cutting interest rates. Business investment continues to disappoint, while dearer fixed-rate mortgages and stagnant house prices make consumers cautious about spending money. The situation cries out for the new government to boost public spending or cut taxes, but Reeves is boxed in by her own self-imposed fiscal rules. Public demands for better public services go unanswered, and disillusionment quickly sets in. Starmer and Reeves insist that their structural reforms will eventually pay dividends but, as was the case when Sunak tried the same line of argument, nobody is listening. Labour’s landslide victory was the result of a collapse in support for the Conservatives rather than a ringing endorsement of Starmer’s offering. Never before has a party won so big a majority with such a modest share of the vote: 34%. Jeremy Corbyn won a bigger percentage of the vote when Labour was defeated in 2017. Starmer and Reeves are on probation as far as Britain’s sceptical and impatient voters are concerned, and they are deluding themselves if they think this is 1997 redux. The economy is weaker and public services are in a worse state. Sitting tight for two years is not an option. It may take time for the Conservatives to recover from the pasting they have just taken, but there are alternative sources of opposition. The Green party threatens to pick up unhappy Labour voters from the left, while Reform UK could do the same from the right. The Liberal Democrats will be attractive for those who want a closer relationship with the EU. The Tories won big in 2019 but last week lost more than 250 seats. Something similar could easily happen to Labour in 2029. So which ending is it going to be? On balance, the happy ending looks slightly more likely. That’s not because the country is set for an economic boom – the UK has deep-seated problems that are not going to be solved overnight. But such was the desire of voters to be shot of the Conservatives that it will take time before they are trusted again. The Tories need Labour to screw up the economy to have a chance of a quick comeback, but it is reasonable to assume that the next five years will be better than the previous five. That might not be saying much, but it should be enough.",

        "title": "Struggles at Belfast’s Titanic shipyard reflect UK’s faded naval power",
        "content": "The Harland &amp; Wolff (H&amp;W) shipyard in Belfast is famous for having built the Titanic, the largest passenger ship of its time before it hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic. But things have moved on since 1912. In recent weeks Samson, one of the two yellow gantry cranes that dominate Belfast’s skyline, has been straddling a giant oil processing vessel. This is the Canadian-owned SeaRose, which is being upgraded by H&amp;W in a contract worth more than £90m. The SeaRose is even larger than the Titanic, weighing in at 150,000 tonnes. The sight of a massive ship in Belfast harbour recalls the city’s glory days as a shipbuilding superpower. H&amp;W collapsed into administration in 2019, but now the shipyard is back at the centre of British hopes to restore something of the industry’s past glories. Those hopes now appear to be under threat as H&amp;W waits for Keir Starmer’s government to decide whether to proceed with a controversial £1.6bn deal that would see the small, Aim-listed company given a £200m loan guarantee completely underwritten by the UK taxpayer. It has six months to find new money to replace previous debts. The yard’s travails illustrate the gap between the UK’s pretensions to be a major military power and the reality in the industry. For all its Herculean endeavours, H&amp;W is a minnow, valued at only £14.5m before its shares were suspended last week after it failed to file accounts on time. Britain once had the most powerful navy in the world – albeit one built to sustain an empire rather than for defence – and even during the Falklands war in 1982 it could muster 23 destroyers and frigates (it now has 17) plus two aircraft carriers. The days of naval supremacy are long gone, but the UK is still a mid-ranking military power, with a nuclear arsenal, a permanent seat on the UN security council and a pledge to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence. In May, Grant Shapps, who was defence secretary until the general election, hailed a “new golden age for British shipbuilding”, with six new warships to be built in the UK, with another 22 military vessels already in the pipeline. Most of the ships will be built by the UK’s two dominant naval shipbuilders, with Type 26 frigates being made by BAE Systems in Govan and Scotstoun near Glasgow, and Type 31 frigates by Babcock International at Rosyth near Edinburgh. BAE also builds submarines for the Royal Navy at Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria. However, the programme also includes three “fleet solid support” ships, which carry ammunition and other supplies to aircraft carriers. That £1.6bn contract has been awarded to a consortium of H&amp;W, Spain’s state-owned shipbuilder Navantia, and British design firm BMT. The government said the contract would create 900 shipyard jobs in Belfast, plus another 300 at a yard in Appledore, Devon, bought by H&amp;W’s owner, InfraStrata, in 2020 after it closed in 2019. Made in Belfast Hundreds of new jobs will provide a huge morale boost for Belfast, but the city will still be a long way from reliving its former glories. In the 19th century, Belfast’s growth matched anything seen in England’s northern industrial cities. According to Graham Brownlow, senior lecturer in economics at Queen’s University Belfast, the city’s population rose from 75,000 in 1841 to 387,000 in 1911, and by 1914 H&amp;W had 14,000 employees. This rapid growth was, he says, an early example of what is now known as industrial strategy, with the city’s Harbour Commission reclaiming land to build docks. John Parker, the veteran industrialist who now chairs builder Laing O’Rourke, joined H&amp;W as an apprentice in the late 1950s, when it ran the largest single shipyard in the world, building on 19 slipways at a time. “It was just the most massive operation” and “an amazing training ground”, said Parker, who went on to become chief executive from 1983-93. Yet from the late 1960s, international competition surged and Northern Ireland’s Troubles took a lot of energy out of the city. The ship now under the Belfast cranes, the SeaRose, was built in South Korea which, together with China and Japan, dominates global non-military shipbuilding, making 94% of the world’s merchant fleet, according to UN figures. “The collapse of UK shipbuilding wasn’t because of a lack of local tonnage being produced,” said Brownlow. “It was because the share of tonnage was falling as the rest of the world caught up.” There’s very little chance of the UK (which contributed no new ships to the merchant fleet in 2023) winning many commercial shipbuilding orders – barring perhaps a dramatic new technology to lower emissions. So any British shipbuilding revival will have to rely on warships – plus perhaps contracts for maintenance, repairs and upgrades that can be handled by smaller yards. Labour has promised a strategic defence review within its first year, before it sets its spending priorities. The party has already made some firm commitments on how it will spend the equivalent of 2.5% of GDP on defence, including sticking closely to the Conservatives’ plan to build four new nuclear submarines. The review would look in detail at every large contract, including the fleet solid support ships, a party source said. This will take time because security classifications mean opposition politicians, like the general public, see only the bare minimum of information about any defence deal. None of that augurs well for the quick turnaround of the H&amp;W loan guarantee expected by chief executive John Wood, who claimed in May on social media that the general election would not delay the deal. Financial troubles A threatened strike has been called off after the company reached a pay agreement with workers. But if the loan guarantee is not given, H&amp;W could be in trouble. Last Monday, the company blamed its share suspension on a dispute with auditors over when it could recognise revenues from future years, and released unaudited figures showing it lost £43m in 2022. It also said: “Should there be any material delays to securing the facility post the general election, the company’s ability to execute new and large contracts would be adversely affected.” The situation is urgent because H&amp;W is carrying massive liabilities. These include $115m (£91m) in loans agreed from March 2022 with Riverstone Credit Management, a private US lender, which is charging it interest of more than 14% a year. H&amp;W said it had made repayments, and reported debt costs of £18m for 2023. The loan must be repaid by 31 December. Significant further delays to the UK loan guarantee would probably eat into the £77m H&amp;W earmarked for capital investments, including new robotic welding machines and an expanded fabrication hall. Riverstone holds charges over H&amp;W’s key properties, including Appledore, the main shipyard, its leases of other yards bought from a collapsed company in Methil and Arnish in Scotland, plus land off Northern Ireland’s coast related to a gas storage project. This means that if H&amp;W defaults on its loans, the yards could fall into the lender’s hands. An H&amp;W spokesperson said: “Our number one priority is investing in our yards and people so that we can capitalise on the significant opportunities facing us, including the landmark fleet solid support contract. We have supportive financing partners and are progressing alternative solutions that are better suited to the long-term growth of our business. “Turnover has increased substantially with the completion of multiple projects and market forecasts are projecting a revenue line of £200m this financial year.” Whatever H&amp;W’s fate, its struggles illustrate the difficulty of spreading warship construction work beyond the big Scottish yards. MPs have raised concerns that much of the building may be carried out in Navantia’s yard in Cádiz, Spain, with only superficial work being done in Belfast and north Devon. Trevor Taylor, professorial fellow at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said he believed it was technically feasible to spread some warship work to other UK yards – as recommended by Parker in a 2016 report for government – because modern ships are built in blocks and then joined together. The Navy’s two Queen Elizabeth- class aircraft carriers were built in blocks at seven yards across Britain before being floated around the coast for assembly at Rosyth, north of Edinburgh. However, Taylor warned that the political attraction of revitalising Belfast is matched by “risks in delivery” because of the need for funding. If H&amp;W were to drop out, one option would be to bring back the previously rejected consortium led by BAE and Birkenhead’s Cammell Laird shipyard. Both Taylor and Parker said the industry had withered to such an extent that companies such as H&amp;W would struggle to build a workforce with the right skills. H&amp;W said this was “categorically not true” and that it had already increased its workforce from 46 to almost 1,600. Emma Evans, defence policy adviser at ADS, a lobby group for the UK defence industry, said the government could change a “feast and famine approach to contracting, which leads to a drain of skills, and makes it very difficult for industry to train, invest, and retain skilled workers”. For Parker, the prize of billions of pounds of economic value being spread across the UK is worth it. “This can be a great source of economic growth,” he said. “Belfast certainly needs that type of opportunity to create highly skilled jobs.” Marine adventures While H&amp;W’s main focus is now on shipbuilding, the company and its chief executive have a history of unorthodox marine projects. Before buying the shipyard out of administration in 2019 and taking its famous name, H&amp;W was called InfraStrata. It emerged out of a gas drilling company in 2008, and tried to frack for gas in Northern Ireland (drawing the ire of Avengers-star-cum-campaigner Mark Ruffalo in the process). It then pivoted to a project for storing gas in salt caverns at Islandmagee, on Northern Ireland’s east coast. H&amp;W suffered a severe blow last month when Belfast’s court of appeal ruled that government approval of the project had not been lawful. The company said it was considering whether it could take its case to the supreme court. Wood joined InfraStrata in 2018, having previously been a director of MSC Europe, a Southampton ship refitter that collapsed in 2007, reportedly owing suppliers £3m. (The company said that Wood had since then “delivered multibillion contracts and run businesses delivering major programmes”.) After a stint managing ship repairs at BAE Systems, and then working for consultancies, he led the £3.3m purchase of the Belfast shipyard in December 2019. But aside from building ships, H&amp;W is now involved in a different marine adventure: setting up a rival to the ferry service from Penzance to the Isles of Scilly, a 28-mile crossing in often-rough seas. The project has been hit by delays in procuring a usable vessel. The company had planned to build the ferry in Appledore, and put in a bid for government levelling-up funding. It abandoned that idea after the government withdrew the funding and sourced a boat from Spain instead. It has blamed heavy rain at the dry dock in Portsmouth for delays to a yellow paint job on the new ferry, which to be called the Atlantic Wolff. The company is taking bookings, but customers have said these are being fulfilled by a 12-passenger rigid inflatable boat, and in some cases a helicopter. Complaints on social media tell of a lack of communication from Scilly Ferries about when the ferry will be in service, after it missed promises to start by June, and then by “mid-June”. H&amp;W it is “committing maximum resources, seven days a week” but added that it was still working on “some important regulatory issues”, including a crucial passenger certificate from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. • This article was amended on 12 July 2024 to clarify that H&amp;W abandoned the plan to build the ferry at Appledore after the government withdrew the funding. A reference to H&amp;W’s leases of “smaller yards” in Methil and Arnish in Scotland has been changed to “other yards bought from a collapsed company”. Also the main image has been changeed. An earlier image was said to be of “the Titanic in dry dock”. In fact it showed the ocean liner’s sister ship, the Olympic.",

        "content": "The first moves of a new prime minister can have lasting consequences. When Clement Attlee went from being wartime deputy prime minister to Labour prime minister in 1945, he had little alternative but to offer the nation the peacetime equivalent of Churchill’s blood, toil, tears and sweat. The age of austerity was born as the UK rebuilt its wartorn economy. Shortages necessarily involved rationing until a fully fledged peacetime economy could be restored. The contrast with the Conservative-Liberal Democrat policy of austerity from 2010 onwards could hardly have been starker. Post-2010 austerity, championed in particular by the then chancellor, George Osborne, was founded on a false economic premise, and on a rightwing approach to cutting back on previous rates of growth of public services in favour of tax cuts. The false premise was that the financial crisis and rise in the budget deficit had been caused by Labour’s putative overspending, whereas the culprit had been the banking crisis. Absurd comparisons were made with the plight of the Greek economy, which was in much more serious trouble. These were made the justification for austerity. Last week’s election result was in part the electorate’s reaction to the cumulative impact of the austerity programme. Austerity seems to have been a slow burner, but by the time the hapless Rishi Sunak called what turned out to be a historic election, one could hardly move without being told that the country was broken, and nothing worked. The examples that have stoked public anger are legion: the strains on the NHS, the state of the railways, the overcrowded prisons, the pollution of the rivers caused by the privatised water companies, soaring poverty necessitating food banks – you name it, there are many reasons why people expressed their frustration. In the run-up to last Thursday, Keir Starmer had several field days rubbing in the Conservatives’ disgraceful record. But he spent precious little time on what should be done about the Brexit horrors which were superimposed on an economy already suffering from austerity. I come back to my opening line, and the lasting consequences of early action, or inaction, by new prime ministers. A classic example of inaction with deleterious consequences came in 1964, when the newly elected Harold Wilson overruled his advisers and resisted their calls to devalue a patently overvalued pound. The misalignment of the currency was hampering the export drive; a series of sterling crises forced resort to deflationary measures which did no good to the government’s growth plans. Eventually, devaluation was forced by the markets on a reluctant Wilson in 1967. But back to Starmer. His equivalent of the devaluation error is a decision which is likely to inhibit his growth plans, with echoes of Wilson in 1964. In this case, however, it was not his first major economic decision in government. No: he took it last week, from what we might call a poll position which more or less guaranteed that he would be in government within a few days. Although Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had several times been dismissive about rejoining the single market and customs union, many pro-Europeans were hoping that this merely reflected Starmer’s fear of upsetting so-called red wall voters who had deserted Labour last time. After all, the press – especially the rightwing press – has been replete in recent months with examples of Starmer changing his mind. But last week, the now prime minister dug in his heels, saying he was ruling out rejoining the European single market in his lifetime: “I’ve been really clear about not rejoining the EU, the single market or the customs union or a return to freedom of movement.” This at a time when the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe has concluded that Labour’s existing plans to improve our trading relationship with Europe will have “minimal” impact on reducing the huge and mounting costs of Brexit. And when the same thinktank finds that 78% – repeat, 78% – of Labour voters say they would vote for a return to the EU! In Labour’s manifesto, the party commits itself to tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade. If ever there were an unnecessary barrier to trade, it is surely our exclusion from the European Union. Don’t get me wrong. The above is intended to be constructive criticism. I admire Starmer and happily join the chorus in marvelling at his achievement in making the Labour party electable in such a short time. This succession of dreadful Conservative governments was crying out for its comeuppance. But Starmer has got to get his act together over the EU. Not in his lifetime? In 1988, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that he did not expect German unification in his lifetime. Two years later, Germany was reunified.",

        "content": "Keir Starmer promised “stability and moderation” in his first speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street, after Labour won a landslide victory that ended 14 years of Conservative government. This had been expected and “priced into” financial markets, so the market reaction was muted today. The pound rose by 0.4% against the dollar to $1.2809, and by 0.3% against the euro to €1.1826. The FTSE 100 index rose by 0.4% in the morning and later gave up its gains to close 37.33 points, or 0.45% lower, at 8,203.93. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 ended the day 0.86% higher at 20,786.65, a gain of 176.31 points. Housebuilders rallied on the London stock market, as investors bet that Starmer’s pledge to bulldoze planning rules and build 1.5m new homes would benefit the sector. Vistry Group rose 3.4%, Taylor Wimpey added 2.8% and Barratt gained 2.4% while Persimmon and Berkeley Group both closed 2.2% higher. Starmer appointed Rachel Reeves, a former Bank of England economist, as chancellor. She is the UK’s first female chancellor. There were mixed feelings in the City, where Jasper Jolly and Mahliqa Ali talked to a number of workers. Here is some reaction from a range of business leaders: Thank you for reading. We’ll be back on Monday. Have a great weekend. Take care! – JK The Invest in Women Taskforce has welcomed the appointment of Rachel Reeves as the first female chancellor, which she co-chairs. Fellow co-chair Debbie Wosskow said: A female chancellor, one of the highest offices in the country, who has already vowed to put women at the heart of economic plans, is so vital. A female chancellor who also recognises the billions that female entrepreneurs could add to Britain’s economy is even better. Reeves has already vowed to close the gender pay gap once and for all, and to make flexible working the norm. These are structural drivers of inequality that should be addressed at a policy level and will play an integral part in allowing women to embrace entrepreneurship. For the most effective change, though, we need to enable a new era of public and private sector collaboration. Just 2% of capital investment goes into all-female founded teams in the UK, and we need to break this decades-long cycle. This is exactly what the taskforce exists to do and, by working with the new chancellor, we will make great strides this year and put the UK on the map for female entrepreneurs. Former Nissan and Aston Martin executive Andy Palmer has said that the Labour party could signal a new phase for the UK automotive industry. Palmer was chief operating officer at Japanese carmaker Nissan, bringing mass manufacturing of electric cars to the UK for the first time. He then led British sportscar maker Aston Martin until 2020. He said he hoped a stable government could attract more inward investment from major companies to build in the UK. He said: I’m no politician, but I am an auto guy, an industry guy. What I saw over the last five years was a disengagement with industry and business. I woke up today with probably a greater sense of optimism for an awful long time, at least in that I’m pretty sure the Labour party will listen to autos and business. Palmer said he believed that the UK needs more battery manufacturing. He is now chair of a Slovakian battery company, Inobat, which could potentially benefit from government support if it were to invest in the UK. We’ve fallen behind dramatically in that green revolution. We need to grasp it. Reeves has a tough task on her hands. Andrew Hunter, a senior economist for Moody’s Analytics, said the Labour may soon have to choose between higher taxes, higher borrowing or spending cuts. The new Labour government has an historically strong electoral mandate, but will still need to tread a fine line between enacting the required spending and reforms to improve public services and revitalise the economy, and maintaining the confidence of financial markets. Moreover, these challenges come at a time when the economy already faces a variety of other risks, including from geopolitical tensions or the possibility that persistent inflation could warrant interest rates staying high for longer than currently assumed. Attracting sufficient levels of private-sector capital through their green investment plans will likely to be key to Labour’s hopes for a sustained resurgence in economic growth. But, while there is an upside risk that this succeeds and helps drive a sustained improvement in the economy’s supply side performance over the coming years, it is not our current baseline forecast. Rachel Reeves, a former Bank of England economist, has become the UK’s first female chancellor. She posted on X: Rachel Reeves has just gone into 10 Downing Street to be appointed chancellor. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, due to be appointed chancellor shortly, have been running a charm offensive with the City of London’s financial sector. Will it work? Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange, an alternative stock exchange focused on smaller companies, said: The first thing they’ve got to do is gain the confidence of the City. The first 100 days is really going to matter. Reeves has “done a good job so far” of reassuring the City with her pitch of stability, said Haynes. However, he said he wanted the government to offer more help to growing companies, and incentives to keep them in the UK rather than going elsewhere. He would particularly like the extension of the enterprise investment scheme, a tax break for investors, to companies that are growing quickly (including many that are listed on his exchange). However, Haynes is sceptical about plans to raise taxes that would hit some of the City’s wealthiest, such as abolishing a loophole that allows private equity bosses to pay capital gains tax on earnings rather than higher income tax, abolishing the tax break for non-domiciled people, and taxing private schools. “It doesn’t help when you read things in the Guardian about putting up capital gains tax,” said Haynes. “That kills entrepreneurship. That’s just total madness.” Mark Mullen, chief executive at Atom Bank, said: There are clear similarities between running a business and running an economy. When revenues stagnate, cost cutting takes over. For years now it feels like we’ve been trying to shrink to greatness and it’s time to change course. We urgently need to invest. In our public services, in infrastructure, in our schools and universities and in housing. Our new government must foster productivity, encouraging regulators to facilitate real competition and holding businesses to account for their failures. It must encourage banks to support SMEs and drive out complacency about falling service standards. Real competition leads to better customer outcomes. When it comes to employee welfare, companies should be encouraged to follow the data and not the dogma. Happy and healthy colleagues are good for business. And our path to net zero can either be a burden or an opportunity. We should make it the latter and incentivise companies to invest in renewables and in a sustainable future. A new government and prime minister offers us a rare opportunity to re-boot UK plc. We must seize it with both hands. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of insurance marketplace Lloyd’s, said: Lloyd’s looks forward to partnering with the new UK Government to generate growth and to build resilience into our economy. Our role is to provide critical solutions to support disaster resilience, insuring the transition and bringing global investment to the UK. We look to the government to bring a period of greater stability and to enact reforms necessary to improve the economy’s competitiveness. Back to the UK election. Bosses in the financial sector have called on the new Labour government to boost investment and increase productivity after the sweeping win under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, write Kalyeena Makortoff and Jasper Jolly. The financial industry is one of the UK’s key sectors, accounting for about one in every 12 pounds generated by the British economy. Labour described financial services in its manifesto as “one of Britain’s greatest success stories”, and has pledged to bring forward public-private partnerships to fund investments in infrastructure. Here is what some of the City’s bosses had to say. Andrea Rossi, chief executive of investment manager M&amp;G, said: With over 12 million people in the UK seeking assistance to achieve financial security and the UK’s financial advice gap widening (only 9% of Brits currently have access to advice), we would want to see any new government implementing policies that encourage long term savings and support better retirement outcomes. There is currently an acute set of societal challenges and barriers to saving for many, with the cost-of-living crisis drastically reducing disposable incomes. We’d look to work with the next government and the wider financial services industry to provide more opportunity for savers to benefit from financial products that meet their investment needs. As a member of Labour’s British Infrastructure Council I look forward to working with the government to unlock private investment to boost infrastructure investment in the UK. Private-public investment initiatives will be key in getting capital to sustainable British real estate and infrastructure projects that can position the UK for sustainable growth. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist, said despite June’s forecast-beating 206,000 gain in non-farm payrolls, overall this was a “disappointing” report given the total 111,000 downward revisions to past months and the further rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, “which puts us one step closer to triggering the Sahm rule on recessions”. That 206,000 gain was also not nearly as good as it looks at first glance, with 70,000 coming from government jobs. Of the 136,00 increase in private payrolls, health care and social assistance accounted for 82,000 of those additional jobs. That suggests cyclical employment increased by only around 50,000, adding to the evidence of weakness in GDP growth, he said. Admittedly, the rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, from 4.0%, was for the “right” reasons, with a 277,000 increase in the labour force eclipsing a muted 116,000 increase in the household survey measure of employment. That means we’re getting closer to triggering the so-called Sahm rule, although since the rate is being driven up mainly by strong labour supply rather than weak labour demand, we would caution against relying on it too heavily in what has been a unique cycle in many respects. The 206,000 increase in employment in June was similar to the average monthly gain of 220,000 over the past year, the bureau said. Government employment rose by 70,000 in June, higher than the average monthly gain of 49,000 over the past 12 months. Healthcare added 49,000 jobs, lower than the average monthly gain of 64,000 over the prior 12 months. Employment in social assistance increased by 34,000 in June, primarily in individual and family services (+26,000). Construction added 27,000 jobs in June, higher than the average monthly gain of 20,000 over the past year. Michael McDonough, chief economist of financial products at Bloomberg, said on X: Job gains occurred in government, health care, social assistance, and construction, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The number of long-term unemployed – those out of work for 27 weeks or more – rose by 166,000 to 1.5 million in June, up from 1.1 million a year earlier. The long-term unemployed accounted for 22.2% of all jobless people in June. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.3% month on month, leaving the annual growth rate unchanged at 3.9%. Non-farm payrolls, key US job market data that is closely watched by the US Federal Reserve bank and financial markets, is out. The unemployment rate has unexpectedly ticked up to 4.1% in June from 4% in May, the highest since November 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The economy added 206,000 new jobs –– more than the 190,000 forecast by economists. However, May’s increase of 272,000 jobs was revised lower to 218,000 and April’s figure was also revised to 108,000 from 165,000. Stock market futures rose on the news, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later, as the data fuelled hopes for interest rate cuts. Labour’s victory in the general election must mark the start of the UK’s transformation to a green and low-carbon economy and society, campaigners and experts have said as the scale of the election win became clear. The Conservatives’ U-turns on the environment had been “as popular with voters as a root canal”, according to Greenpeace, as the party sank to its worst electoral defeat in modern times. The Green party also had its strongest ever general election performance, quadrupling its representation in parliament. This, coupled with Labour’s wide margin of victory, gives Keir Starmer, the next prime minister, a strong mandate to take bold action on net zero and nature, experts and campaigners said. Here is some analysis from our economics editor Larry Elliott: Shares rose a bit. The pound barely budged on the currency markets. There was no shortage of demand for UK government bonds. A dramatic night in politics left the City relatively unmoved. There were three big reasons for that. The first was that a thumping Labour victory had been expected for months. It was, in the parlance of financial markets, fully priced in. A hung parliament would have been a different story but there was never any real prospect of that, and once the results of the exit poll were announced the result was not in doubt. International investors are far more worried about what might happen in the second round of the French elections on Sunday than they were about the outcome in the UK. The second reason there was only the slightest of reaction to the biggest Conservative defeat in history is that the markets think little will change. The small opening rise in the FTSE 100 index of leading London shares was led by housebuilders in anticipation of changes to planning law but Labour’s economic plans are modest and cautious. It has ruled out big increases in spending and taxes and will be subject to rules governing how much it can borrow. Here is our latest market story: Gains on the UK’s FTSE 100 index have petered out and the blue-chip index is now less than 10 points ahead at 8,250, a 0.1% gain. It rose by 0.4% earlier after Keir Starmer’s Labour party cruised to victory in yesterday’s general election, which ends 14 years of Conservative rule. The mid-cap FTSE 250, which is more domestically-focused, is still 1.1% ahead, having climbed 231 points to 20,842. UK government bond prices rose and sterling rose by around 0.2% against the dollar and the euro, to $1.2786 and €1.1814. World stocks hit fresh record highs amid optimism over US rate cuts ahead of key jobs data today, and the euro hit a three-week high ahead of the second round of French elections on Sunday. It rose as high as $1.0825 as polls suggest that France’s far-right National Rally party will fall short of an outright majority. There has been political wrangling by the “republican front,” which saw more than 200 candidates across the political spectrum pull out of three-way second rounds in recent days to pave the path for candidates best placed to defeat the far-right party in their district. The French national football team captain Kylian Mbappé urged people to vote after what he called a “catastrophic” first round last Sunday when the Rassemblement National (RN) party came first. He said: I think that more than ever we have to go and vote, it’s really urgent. We can’t leave our country in the hands of these people, it’s really urgent. MSCI’s world stock index rose 0.3% and European shares climbed 0.4% on the pan-European Stoxx 600. US non-farm payrolls, out in just over an hour, are expected to show that employers added 190,000 jobs last month following May’s 272,000. North Sea oil and gas producers have urged incoming prime minister Keir Starmer for clarity around his election promise to increase tax on the sector, warning that it could lead to a slump in output and revenue and endanger jobs. Labour has said it will raise the windfall tax on energy producers, first imposed in 2022 after energy prices soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, from 75% to 78%. The windfall tax is due to run until 2029. David Latin, chairman of Serica Energy, said without clarity, investment and taxes from oil and gas could drop rapidly. He told Reuters: There’s this misunderstanding which is that somehow we’re a golden goose and we’ll just keep laying eggs. But if you don’t feed the goose with investment dollars it’ll keel over and there will be no more eggs. Earlier today, the industry body Offshore Energies UK said it was “deeply concerned over Labour proposals to impose a further windfall tax and end new licences”. David Whitehouse, the chief executive, said: These policies, if poorly managed, and without industry input will threaten jobs and undermine the decarbonisation of the UK economy. The details matter. A report by the investment bank Stifel has estimated that 100,000 jobs could be lost under a “worst-case scenario” –- if the Labour party commits to no new drilling in the North Sea (which it has not done yet). Meanwhile, the UK Energy Research Centre celebrated the Labour win as a “landslide for a green economy”. Quentin Fitzsimmons, senior fixed income portfolio manager at the US fund manager at T. Rowe Price, has looked at the measures the new Labour government is likely to take. Tax and spending The new government is expected to adhere to current fiscal rules, which stipulate that government debt should fall as a percentage of annual GDP in five years. At present, UK debt to GDP is just under 100% of GDP. Fiscal headroom is limited, so it is unlikely the new government will announce major spending increases or tax cuts. The first budget should come in the autumn, and a prudent approach is expected. Throughout the electoral campaign, Labour emphasised its commitment to fiscal responsibility in a bid to reassure investors it will avoid a repeat of the chaos that engulfed UK government bonds when Liz Truss announced unfunded tax cuts in September 2022. If there are spending shortfalls, the new government is likely to favour raising additional taxes rather than increasing borrowing. Labour market policies He thinks the new government is likely to use labour market policies to reduce social inequality and may announce reforms quite soon. These could include raising the minimum wage and linking it to inflation. However, the government will need to be cautious to ensure it does not exacerbate inflation pressure in the economy. Otherwise, interest rates may need to stay higher for longer. The new government may also push for changes to zero-hour contracts and give employees greater rights from their first day of work, he said. These measures are designed to provide fairer employment conditions across the board. The UK labour market is currently quite flexible, particularly compared to other European countries. This allows for a much faster adjustment to adverse shocks and a lower unemployment rate. Housing and planning reforms; relationship with the EU The new government will likely look to push through housing and planning reforms. If radical enough, it could raise the potential growth rate of the economy. This may be politically costly, but the long-term economic benefits for the UK could be significant. However, it remains to be seen how quickly a major change in planning reform could be implemented. There is also the status of the UK’s relationship with the EU to consider. Although Labour will not seek to undo Brexit, it may seek closer ties with the EU to ease some of the current trade frictions. As with housing reform, this would take a significant amount of time and would require extensive negotiations. However, if a closer UK-EU relationship is forged, it would probably raise the level of potential GDP and lead to a rebound in investment. Shares in the housebuilder Crest Nicholson jumped as much as 11% this morning after it reportedly rebuffed a bid from rival Avant Homes, which is owned by the US hedge fund Elliott Advisors. Avant made an all-share proposal to the board of Crest last month, Sky News reported, but was rejected. Elliott would have become the biggest shareholder in the combined group. Crest shares rose as high as 272.4p and are now trading at 260.2p, valuing the company at nearly £669m. Avant is run by Jeff Fairburn, the former boss of Persimmon, who was booted out after public outrage over his £75m bonus and the poor quality of the firm’s homes. Avant’s move comes weeks after Crest rejected a bid from Bellway, another London-listed housebuilder, that valued the business at £650m. Bellway has until next Thursday to make a formal offer for Crest under UK takeover rules. Chris Jowsey, chief executive at Admiral Taverns, which manages about 1,600 pubs, said: We urge the government to provide an overhaul of the business rates system, introduce beer duty reforms and a cut on employer national insurance to help facilitate the growth of long-term, sustainable pubs that sit at the heart of their communities and support all aspects of local life. Steve Hare, chief executive at the software company Sage, said: Many leaders of the UK’s small and medium-sized businesses will welcome a decisive outcome, as businesses need certainty and a stable policy environment to grow and thrive. Now, to kick-start economic growth, this new Labour Government must take action to support the nation’s small and mid-sized firms. Michael Topham, chief executive of waste removal giant Biffa, said: The government has pledged to collaborate with industry to deliver its manifesto commitments, including a renewed industrial strategy, infrastructure proposals, and ‘green’ economic growth. A stable and clear policy environment with realistic timetables and as much consistency as possible across all devolved nations will be key to allowing the waste sector to invest and innovate. Labour has sought to position itself as a pro-business party since Keir Starmer became leader in 2020, and has put the economy and business at the centre of its pitch to voters. In a letter in May, 121 founders, chief executives and former leaders from financial services, retail and manufacturing firms backed Labour’s economic plans. John Roberts, chief executive of electrical retailer AO World, said the business sector had some “clarity” following Labour’s win and called on the new government to deliver on its “clear mandate”. He said the Conservatives have been “dysfunctional for some time” and added he was “hopeful” for the country and business sector under a change of government. He told the PA news agency: There’s a really clear mandate for what is finally an elected leader to go and deliver. Alex Baldock, chief executive of the electrical retailer Currys, urged Labour to follow through on its manifesto promise to replace business rates and overhaul business taxation. He said: Retailers are looking for stability, of course, but also for the government to provide the conditions for growth, through better skills, infrastructure and planning. Most of all, we must urgently fix the broken, damaging and unfair burden of business rates. We urge the government to consult and act on all of this and, as they do so, we at Currys will engage with them all the way. Bosses across the retail, energy and hospitality sectors have urged the incoming Labour Government to fulfil its pledge of prioritising economic growth after Sir Keir Starmer’s election victory. Starmer and the Labour Party are preparing to form a government after routing the Conservatives in yesterday’s general election. Greg Jackson, founder of the UK’s biggest energy provider Octopus, said the result was a “landslide for a green economy”. Voters have rejected anti-net zero rhetoric and chosen cheaper, cleaner, more secure energy. Jackson has previously expressed support for Labour’s plan to set up a state-owned energy investment company, GB Energy, which is a central part of Labour’s pitch to decarbonise the UK by 2030. Jackson told the Guardian: This is a golden opportunity for a Labour government to deliver bold reforms which can unleash green growth. And the sooner they start, the sooner these changes can bring benefit to the UK. Planning reform is arcane and complex and challenging, but this is the key to kickstarting growth. Shell has warned investors that it will take an impairment charge of up to $2bn in its next set of results after it was forced to halt work on Europe’s largest biofuel project and sell off a Singapore refinery. Shell told investors to expect a non-cash writedown of between $600m and $1bn when it publishes its second-quarter results next month due to trouble at a major biofuel project in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The company expects to take a hit of between $600m to $800m on the Singapore refining and chemicals hub that it agreed to sell in May. The company’s share price slipped from 2,917.50p a share as markets opened to 2,897.50p, broadly in line with its trading levels earlier this week. Shell said on Tuesday that had “temporarily paused” the construction of a major biofuel plant in Rotterdam in the Netherlands which was expected to convert waste into green jet fuel and biodiesel by the end of the decade. The oil giant’s biggest energy transition project has struggled with technical difficulties that have delayed its progress so far. It had expected to start producing up to 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year in April, before this was pushed back to 2025. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown said that given the poll forecasts, the Labour landslide “caused few ripples on financial markets”. The lack of movement was unsurprising given that the overall result had already been priced in. However, the domestically focused FTSE 250, gained more ground, with a little more confidence swirling about the UK’s prospects. Nevertheless, with an estimated 34% of the vote, Labour still took the lowest share for a governing party in history, with the Conservatives at 24% and Nigel Farage’s far-right Reform UK party at 14%. Streeter said: There may be a honeymoon period for the new administration, but then difficult decisions will have to be taken in office. The size of the victory and the upswell of support for smaller parties and independents will leave Labour MPs concerned about the safety of their seats at the next election. They know they have to deliver for the electorate but are likely to be hampered by a commitment to be fiscally responsible and restrain spending. The priority will be keeping the markets unruffled in the first days, weeks and months of the new administration and not overdoing spending pledges. There may be some tinkering with the borrowing rules at some point in the future, to distinguish between day-to-day spending and investment, to propel long term growth, potentially loosening the purse further ahead. So far, this doesn’t seem to have perturbed the debt markets, with bond investors still appearing to be more sensitive to interest rate speculation than the investment plans of an incoming government. 10-year gilt yields barely changed, hovering around 4.2%, down from almost 4.7% last October. This result comes on the heels of a steady rise for the UK market, retaking its crown as Europe’s most valuable for the first time in nearly two years last month. With political turmoil in France now taking centre stage, the UK looks finally set to enter into a period of financial stability which has the potential to spark renewed investor interest in UK assets. While the FTSE 100 rose by 0.3%, the more UK-focused FTSE 250 index is storming ahead after Labour’s election victory, rising 375 points to 20,985, a gain of 1.8% and taking it to its highest level since April 2022. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explained: A Labour government could pave the way for an outperformance of more domestically focused mid-cap stocks if Keir Starmer’s party works to ensure fiscal stability and helps to lift confidence in the UK economy. Starmer will inherit a significantly improved economy with inflation now back down to the 2% target, retreating from 2022’s 41-year highs and with UK growth back on track again after last year’s short shallow recession. There could also be a further boost to economic confidence next month for Labour if the Bank of England finally decides to start cutting interest rates, potentially paving the way for a notable reduction in mortgage costs over the next year. Shares across Europe have climbed to more than one-week highs. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose 0.4%, boosted by technology stocks (up 0.9%). Germany’s Dax has gained 0.7% while France’s CAC is 0.4% ahead (after closing 0.8% higher yesterday) and Italy’s FTSE MiB increased by 0.5%. Shares in Aixtron, a German supplier to the semiconductor industry, rallied more than 15% after it reported strong second-quarter orders. Turning to the pound, which is now trading 0.15% higher against the dollar at $1.2778, Scholar said: The election outcome alleviates some of the UK’s recent political uncertainty, providing a small uptick for the British currency against the US dollar – it is now the strongest performing currency against the greenback this year. Meanwhile sterling is also in the green against the euro, reflecting not just the sense of hope around the incoming Labour government but also the uncertainty around France’s political future which has been weighing on the eurozone’s common currency. Labour has won the largest landslide since 1997, in line with polling trends in recent weeks. Jefferies economists say that for all the UK’s challenges, “it is arguably better positioned than for years, with cheap valuations, recovering GDP growth and lower policy volatility. We see this political change as a major positive for UK housebuilders”. Jefferies analysts led by Glynis Johnson said: For UK housebuilders, it’s less about the variation in macro outcome as a result of who wins, but more that a government led by Labour appears more supportive, engaged &amp; focused on delivery of homes. The UK Home Builders Federation (HBF) reports it has had a lot of engagement with the Labour Party in the past year, with meetings and updates with the Labour leader, chancellor, deputy leader &amp; secretary of state for housing, housing minister as well as a wide range of prospective parliamentary candidates. HBF reports that across these interactions, the Labour Party message has been consistent—Labour is looking to appear positive for business as a whole, but in particular positive on planning, seeing it as a barrier not just to housing, but a range of drivers of economic growth as a whole. Sector-specific policy from Labour appears a distinct positive and Labour’s planning ambitions in its manifesto we believe could fuel land release to underpin the next cycle of profits for the UK housebuilders. The lack of credible large-scale demand support in its manifesto doesn’t add additional nitro to this upside. But with valuations only reflecting current very moderate house price inflation, our analysis suggests neither the benefit of rate cuts over summer nor this potential land opportunity is in share prices. Here is our full story on the markets: UK housebuilders are leading gains on the FTSE 100 index, which is now trading 0.4% higher, up 31 points at 8,272. Persimmon, Vistry Group, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments are among the top risers, rising between 1.7% and 2.5%. The UK housebuilders’ index rose around 2%. The FTSE 250 index, which is more UK-focused than the FTSE 100, has notched up a 0.8%. Analysts at Investec said they expect the new government to restore mandatory housebuilding targets, streamline the planning system and increase the amount of social and affordable housing being built. Housing was a key part of the Labour election manifesto, where they pledged to build 1.5m new homes over the next five years. Boom! And we’re off. The UK’s FTSE 100 rose some 20 points, or 0.3%, to 8,265 at the open -- as expected. The Labour victory had long been priced into financial markets. In the rest of Europe, France’s CAC rose 0.3% and Germany’s Dax climbed 0.4% in early trading. Sterling is holding steady, trading slightly higher against the dollar and the euro at $1.2762 and €1.1796. Government bond prices also rose, pushing the yield (or interest rate) on the 10-year gilt down 3 basis points to 4.17%, broadly in line with other European markets. Goldman Sachs has raised its 2025 and 2026 economic growth forecasts for the UK following Labour’s resounding election victory. Goldman Sachs strategists led by Sven Jari Stehn said: Firmer demand is likely to result in marginally higher wage growth and inflation, but the magnitudes involved suggest that the implications for the Bank of England are likely to be limited. Here is some reaction from the energy sector. Offshore Energies UK said it was “deeply concerned over Labour proposals to impose a further windfall tax and end new licences”. David Whitehouse, the chief executive, said: These policies, if poorly managed, and without industry input will threaten jobs and undermine the decarbonisation of the UK economy. The details matter. Homegrown offshore energy is a jewel in the UK’s industrial crown that government must treasure. The Labour party has put economic growth at the heart of its plans, and our offshore energy sector can deliver just that. UK offshore energy companies could invest £200bn in homegrown energy production this decade alone in carbon storage, hydrogen, and wind opportunities alongside the homegrown oil and gas we all need. Labour leadership has recognised that North Sea oil and gas will be with us for decades to come and committed to managing this strategic national asset in a way that does not jeopardise jobs. The transition is estimated to cost £1.4trillion, the lion’s share of which will need to come from the private sector. Working together, we need to create the conditions to unlock this investment. He said the industry is looking for a “follow through on assurances to work in partnership with the sector, listen to our skilled people, and ensure no one is left behind in the UK’s energy transition”. Housebuilders are expected to benefit from the new Labour government. Labour has pledged to build 1.5m new homes over the next five years – a promise it insists it will immediately put into motion. Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at the wealth manager Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, the wealth manager, said: With Britons waking up to a new Labour government today, many may wonder whether their landslide victory will inject some momentum into the UK property market. A stable political environment can potentially deliver a confidence boost to the housing market, particularly one that has struggled over the past year with high borrowing costs and a dearth of available and affordable stock. Buying a first home, upsizing and even downsizing are all major personal finance decisions, which is why confidence in how your country is run is vitally important. Interest rates have remained at a 16-year high of 5.25% for almost a year causing major affordability challenges for first-time buyers and those looking to move to larger homes. While the combination of lower inflation and strong wage growth has offered a slight boost to housing affordability, for many the dream of home ownership is still out of reach. Throw in interest rate cuts, however, with the first reduction expected as early as next month on August 1, and, in turn, more competitive mortgage rates and the market could experience a surge in demand. Several major mortgage lenders have already begun trimming their headline deals and while a UK rate reduction would improve mortgage rates for new borrowers and those on trackers, it won’t ease the concerns for those locked into fixed rate deals with some time left to run. Those on long-term fixes taken out before or during the early stages of the Bank of England’s rate-hiking cycle will still face higher repayments when they eventually come to refinance, Haine said. Labour will be keen to encourage more first-time buyers to get a foot on the UK’s housing ladder, something that has become a major challenge for many young, and not so young, buyers in recent years who have struggled to find affordable homes in many parts of the country. Boosting housebuilding, along with a proposed planning overhaul, reclassification of green belt land and a new mortgage guarantee scheme are all ways that can lure more first-time buyers into the market and improve the supply and demand imbalance. These proposals can take time, however, though some buyers may be happy to wait for the election dust to settle before they plough into the market. UK house prices dipped in June in a “subdued market,” according to the mortgage lender Halifax. Its monthly house price index showed the average price of a home slipped by 0.2% in June from May, by less than £500 in cash terms, leaving the annual growth rate at 1.6%. A typical home in the UK now costs £288,455, compared to £288,931 in May. House prices stayed relatively flat for a third successive month in June, while Northern Ireland recorded the strongest annual growth in the UK, at 4%, up from 3.3%. The average price of a property there is now £192,457. Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax, said: This continued stability in house prices – rising by just +0.4% so far this year – reflects a market that remains subdued, though overall activity has been recovering. For now it’s the shortage of available properties, rather than demand from buyers, that continues to underpin higher prices. Mortgage affordability is still the biggest challenge facing both homebuyers and those coming to the end of fixed-term deals. This issue is likely to be eased gradually, through a combination of lower interest rates, rising incomes, and more restrained growth in house prices. While in the short-term the housing market is delicately balanced and sensitive to the pace of change to Base Rate, based on our current expectations property prices are likely to rise modestly through the rest of this year and into 2025. In England, the steepest rate of house price inflation is found in the north west, up by 3.8% over the last year, to an average property price of £231,351. House prices in Scotland also increased, with a typical property now costing £204,663, 1.6% more than the year before. In Wales, house prices grew annually by 2.7% to reach £220,197. Eastern England was the only region or nation across the UK to register a decline in house prices over the last year, where they now average £328,747, down 0.9% in June on an annual basis. London continues to have the most expensive prices in the UK, now averaging £536,306, up 0.9% year on year. Sterling has edged up nearly 0.1% to $1.2769 while stock markets open in about an hour, with the FTSE 100 index expected to make modest gains. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: With the general election behind us - and more political uncertainty and hopefully less scandals ahead - the Labour win is seen as being net positive for the pound and the British stocks. Cable fell from near $1.50 pre-Brexit to almost parity at the peak of the Tory disillusion with Liz Truss mini budget crisis, the changing government gives hope that at least a part of the weakness could be recovered. For stocks, the small and medium sized stocks are expected to perform stronger than the FTSE 100 – which is more exposed to the global economic dynamics due to its high concentration of energy and mining stocks. But both should see the benefits of the upcoming rate cut from the Bank of England – and additionally the other major central banks into the year end. Turning to France, which holds its second election round on Sunday, she said: In France, the situation looks better from a market perspective, as well. The latest polls suggest that Marine Le Pen’s National Rally could fall ‘well short’ of a majority at this weekend’s second and final tour of legislative elections. The party is forecasted to win between 190 to 250 seats out of 577, which will leave it significantly below the 289 majority needed to pass bills easily. As such, the French will probably not see their taxes lowered as promised by Le Pen and investors will hopefully not see the French debt levels explode irresponsibly following this chaotic ‘snap election’ parentheses. Investors are now in a hurry to return to French assets and the euro at discounted prices not to miss the post-election rally next Monday. The spread between the German and French 10-year yield fell below 70 from last week’s peak of 86. The CAC 40 rose by 0.8% to 7,695 yesterday, extending the rally seen in recent days, but Ozkardeskaya noted that the French index remains well below the 8,000 mark where it was trading when Macron announced the snap election. It will probably shrug off the election fear with a further recovery but in the medium run, a hung government will prevent the French from moving forward with any reforms: that’s positive when you think of unsustainable tax cuts but that’s not necessarily positive for the long term growth as other reforms will also be blocked. JPMorgan’s UK Economist Allan Monks said little is known about the details of Labour’s approach to fiscal policy, and this is unlikely to change immediately following the election result. The party is communicating that there will be no major tax rises, no significant spending cuts and no slippage from the current fiscal rules, all while boosting trend growth. Absent good luck, it will be difficult to achieve all these commitments over the next parliament, in our view. From a strategy perspective, Mislav Matejka, the bank’s head of global and European equity strategy, rates the UK equity market overweight, with a preference for the FTSE-250 over FTSE-100, and sees a Labour win as positive for banks and homebuilders, mixed for utilities and general retail and less positive for transport and energy sectors. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, said: Business will welcome such a clear result and an end to the political and economic instability of the last few years which is essential for companies to now bring forward much needed investment. Looking ahead, the new government has a lot in its in-tray to address. First and foremost is the urgent need to kick start the UK’s anaemic growth levels of recent years and, boost investment in our infrastructure, without which we cannot address the many urgent priorities the country faces at national and regional level. A modern, long-term industrial strategy which tackles the skills crisis in particular will be key to delivering this growth. Manufacturers stand ready to work with the new government and all stakeholders as a matter of urgency to help deliver this. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the new government’s policies mean economic growth could be higher. The big shift in the political landscape that has delivered the first Labour government since May 2010 is unlikely to lead to anything like as big a shift in the economic landscape. But at the margin, the policies of the new Labour government generate some upsides to our GDP, inflation and interest rate forecasts. The stability of the pound overnight is no surprise as a Labour win was already priced into the markets. “The economy may give Labour a helping hand,” he said. He explained: Labour is taking over just as inflation has fallen back to the 2% target and the Bank of England is on the cusp of cutting interest rates from 5.25%. Our forecasts that inflation will fall a bit further and the Bank will cut rates to 3% next year explains why we think GDP growth will accelerate, to 1.2% this year and to 1.5% in both 2025 and 2026. Moreover, our current estimate is that at the first fiscal event after the election (probably in September), the Office for Budget Responsibility will grant Labour fiscal headroom of around £16bn (0.6% of GDP), up from £8.9bn (0.3%) in the March budget. That may mean Labour can raise spending a bit further than planned without raising taxes or borrowing by more than planned. Looser fiscal policy, though, may just mean inflation is a little higher and interest rates don’t fall as far. “What a difference five years makes, Labour have turned themselves around” and are on course for a decisive victory, Kathleen Brooks, research director at the currency broker XTB, said. Since the result is broadly as expected, the pound has had a muted reaction to [the] news. Due to this, the focus will now shift to what the future holds. Sir Keir Starmer still needs to lay out in more detail his plans for spending and taxation, and, most importantly, how he will grow the economy. The financial markets trust that the UK’s fiscal position is secure with Labour, hence why bond yields and the pound have remained stable during this election campaign. The focus now will quickly shift to Starmer’s first 100 days in office, and how he lays out his economic plans to boost growth at the same time as improving public services. Investors will be watching to ensure that Keir Starmer maintains his ‘stability’ message and fiscal prudence, otherwise he could find that the bond vigilantes are never far away. Ultimately, it’s the bond market that will determine Labour’s fiscal policies. Sterling has firmed slightly this morning. It has risen since Rishi Sunak called the election in late May, and is the strongest-performing major currency against the dollar this year, with a gain of 1.2%. Laura Foll, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, said: It’s a breath of fresh air to be running [UK] equities in a market where the election is seen as a non-event. I’m hoping we’re going back to an era where boring is good and politics treads lighter in people’s lives. It will be a more gradual lifting [of confidence]. Government borrowing costs were little changed, with the yield (or interest rate) on the 10-year gilt rising by 6 basis points. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. We’ve woken up to a landslide Labour victory in the UK. Keir Starmer has pledged that it is “now time for us to deliver” as his party’s election victory brings an end to 14 years of Conservative rule. The Labour leader is expected to become prime minister later today. Rishi Sunak’s party is on track to record its worst ever performance in a general election. As the results are broadly as expected and already priced into financial markets, the pound held steady. It has firmed slightly against the dollar, by 0.1% at $1.2770, and was up a smidgen against the euro at €1.18. Stock market futures are pointing to a higher open on the FTSE 100 index in a couple of hours. The London Chamber of Commerce said the business community looks forward to a “fresh start” under Labour. Chief executive Karim Fatehi said: We look forward to working with government over the coming years to build a London where businesses of all sizes thrive. Now is the time for the new government to quickly make the changes businesses need to succeed. As laid out in our manifesto this includes the introduction of policies that protect and support the capital’s businesses, enhance London’s international competitiveness, and simplify and enable infrastructure and planning. These policies will lay the foundations for future growth, address long term skills shortages, and foster greater innovation in our capital. The CBI business group said “business stands ready to bring its innovation, ideas, and investment to make that shared mission a reality”. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI’s chief executive, said: The new prime minister has been given a clear mandate to take the tough decisions on areas like planning reform and boosting grid capacity needed to get the economy firing on all cylinders. What firms need now is a government that’s ready to hit the ground running and is laser-focused on delivery. Households and businesses across the UK have shown incredible resilience through Brexit, Covid and war in Europe. With the economy picking up steam, now is the moment to get behind growth. Setting out a positive vision for the UK economy and leaning into our international leadership should be top priorities for the first 100 days. The TUC said Labour has a “historic opportunity” to “repair and rebuild Britain”. The union’s general secretary Paul Nowak said: The trade union movement stands ready to work with this new government to deliver the change working families desperately need. This means tackling the scourge of insecure work and boosting living standards. It means fixing our crumbling public services. And it means reversing over a decade of Tory stagnation with a proper plan for growth and industrial revival.

        "title": "China to hold hearing into brandy imports as tension grows with EU over tariffs on EVs",
        "content": "China has ramped up its anti-dumping investigation into European brandy imports in what appears to be a retaliatory move as the EU imposed higher tariffs on imports of Chinese electric vehicles from Friday. The commerce ministry in Beijing said it would hold a hearing on 18 July to discuss an investigation into claims that European brandy producers are selling products in China below market rates. The hearing was requested by the brandy houses Martell, Societe Jas Hennessy &amp; Co, Rémy Martin and other stakeholders, the ministry said in a statement. The investigation could result in China adding duties on brandy imports coming from the EU, which would hit European producers. The hearing was announced on the same day that the EU imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EV imports coming into the bloc, which had held a nine-month anti-subsidy investigation amid claims that heavily subsidised Chinese vehicles were flooding the EU market and harming European manufacturers. The action by the EU will lead to tariffs ranging from 17.4% to 37.6% being applied on Chinese EV imports from Friday. The EU will then run a four-month window before they become permanent. In response to the EV tariffs and an escalation of tensions, China launched what appeared to be a tit-for-tat investigation into European brandy imports after a request by the China Alcoholic Drinks Association. French producers would be the hardest hit by any tariffs, with France accounting for about 99% of all EU brandy imports into China. China has repeatedly urged the EU to cancel its EV tariffs and has called for further talks. At a press conference on Thursday, a commerce ministry spokesperson reiterated Beijing’s desire to resume negotiations over EV tariffs. Valdis Dombrovskis, a European Commission vice-president, brushed aside concerns of trade war retaliation from Beijing against European business in light of the EV tariffs. In June China announced it would be opening a probe into EU pork imports. The Chinese state-backed Global Times reported this week that officials were also considering opening an anti-subsidy probe into European dairy imports and imposing tariffs on large-engined petrol cars manufactured in Europe. The tariffs imposed by the EU on Chinese EVs are far lower than those recently introduced by the US, with Joe Biden announcing 100% tariffs in May. However, some European manufacturers have criticised the EU moves. Volkswagen has argued that they will not strengthen Europe’s car industry in the long-term. Stellantis, the owner of brands including Citroën, Fiat and Vauxhall, has said it will not take a defensive stance in the battle for electric car sales and prefers to “fight to stay competitive”.",

        "title": "Shops and restaurants hope for ‘halo’ effect of Labour win and big weekend of sport",
        "content": "Shops, bars and restaurants are expected to see a halo effect as Labour’s election victory and a bumper weekend of sport kickstarts a bounce in consumer spending through July. Businesses are predicted to benefit from England’s match at the Euro 2024 football tournament and Andy Murray’s Wimbledon swan song this weekend, before the Olympics propels spending at the end of the month. Hospitality and retail are also forecast to make gains as a result of Keir Starmer’s election victory, as a change in government tends to aid the economy. Consumer sentiment and retail spending improved in the first month after both the 1997 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 elections, according to separate research from analysts at GlobalData and the advisory firm PwC. Spending will be supercharged by the Euros quarter-final between England and Switzerland on Saturday, which is on the same day as Emma Raducanu and Murray’s Wimbledon doubles match, potentially marking the Scottish player’s final appearance at the tournament. Football fans are expected to provide the UK economy with a £419.5m boost during the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 – which kick off with Spain against the hosts, Germany, on Friday afternoon – according to research by GlobalData for Vouchercodes, which predicts that 24.8 million Britons will tune in to support the England men’s team. More than half of those will watch at home, with fans likely to stock up on pizza, crisps and beer, while many head out to bars and pubs. Tesco said alcohol sales are set “to be brisk”, with the supermarket expecting to sell 3.5m items of beer and cider to wash down 1m packs of sausages and 1.3m punnets of strawberries. Supporters are also set to consume 13.4m pints in the pub as they cheer on the Three Lions. With drama on the pitch and in Westminster, it is not clear whether hopeful champagne socialists or optimistic football fans have driven a 36% lift in searches for the sparkling French wine at Ocado this week. Before the election result, almost 36% of consumers said they would be confident about spending more in the event of a Labour victory, compared with 28% if the Conservatives held on to power, according to GlobalData. The figures are more dramatic for those under 45, with almost 58% of those aged 18 to 24 saying they would spend more if Labour got in. Kien Tan, a senior retail adviser at PwC, said: “I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a bit of a boost. We have had a year of real income growth, so people should feel a bit more confident to go out. July will get a bit of a halo. “When the Conservative government came in [in 2010] there was a honeymoon period that lasted about six months before austerity kicked in. Consumers want longer-term certainty and now they know the government will be in place for at least four years.” He said the new government could benefit from “indicators moving in the right direction”, with cuts in national insurance and the increase in the legal minimum wage and pensions, as well as expected interest cuts. The retail and hospitality industry is also likely to outperform sales figures registered during a very poor July and August last year, when the weather was cold and wet and consumers favoured spending on watching Barbie and Oppenheimer at the cinema. Patrick O’Brien, a research director at GlobalData, said: “There is a bit more optimism that retail will do better in the next 12 months than the previous 12 months.” He said that younger age groups may be feeling particularly positive with “maybe not euphoria but good feeling”, and so those businesses that serve the under-40s may benefit. The expected mini-boom is partly a reaction to a dip in spending ahead of the election as nervousness about the future prompts households to hold off on major projects. In 2019, after Boris Johnson was elected, the volume of items sold by retailers in the UK rose more than 6% in the first month after the election, after a 6% decline in the previous month. This year there has been a dip in sentiment since the election was announced, ending a long run of recovery since Liz Truss’s mini-budget sent markets into a tailspin in late 2022, according to GlobalData. There has been a particular slowdown in big-ticket spending, such as furniture or large household appliances. However, the weather could be the biggest factor in any short-term spending lift. Tan said pent-up demand for summer gear after a wet May and June could help to drive sales in July and August if the summer is less damp and cold than last year.",

        "content": "The labor market started to ease in June, with 206,000 jobs added to the US economy last month, according to new labor data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The number of new jobs is close to what economists had expected for the month. The figures represent a slight cooling compared to May, when the economy added a revised 218,000 jobs. The unemployment rate in June was 4.1%, a 0.1% increase compared with May and the first time the rate has been above 4% in over two years. Data released earlier this week suggested the labor market was starting to cool. Payroll firm ADP reported that private employers added 150,000 jobs in June, down from 157,000 in May. Job losses also appear to be growing. Executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas reported 48,786 job cuts in June, down from 63,816 cuts in May but still a nearly 20% increase compared with June of last year. The jobs figures, released on the first Friday of every month, have been closely watched by Wall Street, which is eager to see interest rates drop, and in Washington, where the strength of hiring has been one of the few bright spots for the Biden administration, which is struggling with poor polling on its economic policies. Along with inflation figures, which come out later in the month, the Federal Reserve uses jobs figures to determine whether the economy is cooling and ready for interest rates to drop. Last month, officials at the Fed kept rates at a two-decade high of around 5.3%, where it has been for nearly a year. The Fed has been trying to bring inflation down to 2%. In May, inflation sat at 3.4% – lower than its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but still higher than the Fed’s target rate. Minutes from the Fed’s last meeting were released on Wednesday and showed the central bank was waiting for “additional favorable data” before making cuts. But in bringing inflation down, the Fed must make sure the labor market is not cooling too much. Earlier this week, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said at an event that the economy has “made a lot of progress” and has “seen a pretty substantial move toward better balance” in the labor market. “We want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down. We want to understand that the levels that we’re seeing are a true reading on what is actually happening with underlying inflation,” Powell said. Inflation figures for June will be released on 11 July. The Fed’s next meeting is on 30 and 31 July.",

        "title": "UK house prices remain subdued for third successive month",
        "content": "House prices have remained “subdued” for a third month in a row, according to a leading lender, but a recent run of mortgage rate reductions is offering hopes of improvement in the market. The average house price hit £288,455 in June, Halifax reported, down only 0.2% on the £288,931 recorded in May, as a shortage of properties kept prices high. House price growth on an annual basis remained unchanged at 1.6%. The latest figures from the mortgage lender – which cover much of the election campaign – mark the third consecutive month that house prices have stayed relatively flat. Amanda Bryden, the Halifax’s head of mortgages, said house prices had posted a seventh consecutive month of year-on-year growth.“This continued stability in house prices – rising by just 0.4% so far this year – reflects a market that remains subdued, though overall activity has been recovering. “For now, it’s the shortage of available properties, rather than demand from buyers, that continues to underpin higher prices.” She said that mortgage affordability remained the biggest challenge for new homebuyers, as well as those coming to the end of deals. However, the prospect of the Bank of England cutting interest rates in August or September has led to a flurry of mortgage reductions this week, offering some relief to buyers and borrowers and stoking hopes of an improved picture later this year. Earlier this week, Barclays announced that it would cut a selection of its fixed-rate mortgages by 0.27 percentage points, while Halifax lowered rates by 0.19 points and Santander cut rates by 0.16 points on Thursday. Leeds Building Society announced that on Monday it would cut its residential mortgage rates by up to 0.15 percentage points. Mark Harris, the chief executive of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: “With the big five lenders – Barclays, HSBC, Santander, Halifax and NatWest – reducing their mortgage rates this week, lenders continue to jostle for business as they ramp up the summer sales.” He added said: “Those lenders who haven’t yet repriced are likely to follow suit, as long as service levels allow, which is welcome news for hard-pressed borrowers.” Analysis by Rightmove published last month found that monthly mortgage costs for first-time buyers had increased by more than 60% since the 2019 general election. It said the average monthly mortgage payments for a typical first-time buyer was now £1,075 a month, up from £667 in 2019. Bryden said that she expected mortgage costs to ease gradually through a combination of lower interest rates, rising incomes and more restrained growth in house prices. London continues to have the most expensive property in the country, Halifax found, with the average home in the capital costing £536,306, up 0.9% in June on a year earlier. The south-east of England was the second most expensive area, with the average house price at £385,056, while the north-east was the least expensive, with the average property costing £172,308. The highest property price growth in the UK was in Northern Ireland, with properties costing £192,457 on average, a 4% increase on an annual basis. Bryden said: “While in the short-term the housing market is delicately balanced and sensitive to the pace of change to base rate, based on our current expectations property prices are likely to rise modestly through the rest of this year and into 2025.” Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chair of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “The election definitely added to nervousness in the property market but slower-than-expected falls in mortgage rates weighed more heavily. “We are hearing in our offices and on the ground that most buyers and sellers put moves on hold so we expect the resilient recovering of activity to remain.” He added: “Looking forward, the rise in listings means prices will stay stable and the arrival of a new government will add certainty.”",

        "title": "Housebuilders rally as investors bet on Starmer’s new homes pledge",
        "content": "Housebuilders rallied sharply on the London stock market after Labour’s landslide general election victory as investors bet that Keir Starmer’s pledge to bulldoze planning rules and build 1.5m new homes would benefit the sector. After the party secured a majority widely expected in financial markets, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies and the pound edged higher on Friday while government borrowing costs remained roughly unchanged. The FTSE 100 later pared gains to finish the day down 0.5% at 8,203, while the more domestic-focused FTSE 250 closed up 0.9%. City analysts said a clear Labour win could bring stability to British politics after years of turmoil under the Conservatives since the 2016 Brexit vote, while positioning Britain as a “safe haven” for global investors amid rising political instability in the US and France. “A landslide victory provides the sort of clarity and stability that equity markets need in an increasingly volatile world,” said Ben Ritchie, the head of developed market equities at the fund manager abrdn. “If the new government get this right, businesses with significant exposure to the UK economy should be the likely winners.” Housebuilders were the biggest gainers, with Persimmon, Vistry, Barratt and Taylor Wimpey among the top risers in the FTSE 100. Shares in Crest Nicholson jumped as much as 11% after it reportedly rebuffed a bid from its rival Avant Homes, which is owned by the US hedge fund Elliott Advisors. Avant made an all-share proposal to the board of Crest last month, Sky News reported, which was rejected. Elliott would have become the biggest shareholder in the combined group. Weeks earlier Crest had rejected a bid from Bellway, another London-listed housebuilder, that valued the business at £650m. Analysts at the investment bank Jefferies said Labour’s win was “a major positive for UK housebuilders” as the party “appears more supportive, engaged and focused on delivery of homes”. Starmer had made planning reform a centrepiece of his election campaign to “get Britain building again”, aiming to spur economic growth, create jobs and build 1.5m new homes over the next parliament. The pound rose 0.4% against the dollar to $1.28, with sterling the strongest performing big currency against the dollar this year after rallying in the run-up to Thursday’s vote. Currency markets had widely priced in a Labour landslide and Starmer’s key message that he would seek to restore stability, improve economic growth and take a fiscally responsible approach to government. After four prime ministers in five years, sterling has recovered from a record low of $1.03 in 2022, when Liz Truss’s mini-budget triggered a meltdown in financial markets that required the Bank of England to intervene to prevent pension funds from going bust. Labour’s election victory comes against a backdrop of an improving economy. Inflation has returned to the government’s 2% target, after a prolonged period of soaring price rises and a peak inflation rate of 11.1% in October 2022. That was the highest level in 41 years. The economy has recovered from a shallow recession at the end of 2023 and grew by 0.7% in the first quarter of the 2024, in the latest official data. As inflation comes down, the Bank of England is expected to start cutting interest rates, possibly as soon as next month, in a move that will provide relief and hope for households facing sharply higher mortgage costs. Kathleen Brooks, the research director at the broker XTB, said investors would now concentrate on what Labour does in the early days of power. “The focus now will quickly shift to Sir Keir Starmer’s first 100 days in office, and how he lays out his economic plans to boost growth at the same time as improving public services.”",

        "title": "Markets left barely stirred by Labour’s thumping election win",
        "content": "Shares rose a bit. The pound barely budged on the currency markets. There was no shortage of demand for UK government bonds. A dramatic night in politics left the City relatively unmoved. There were three big reasons for that. The first was that a thumping Labour victory had been expected for months. It was, in the parlance of financial markets, fully priced in. A hung parliament would have been a different story but there was never any real prospect of that, and once the results of the exit poll were announced the result was not in doubt. International investors are far more worried about what might happen in the second round of the French elections on Sunday than they were about the outcome in the UK. The second reason there was only the slightest of reaction to the biggest Conservative defeat in history is that the markets think little will change. The small opening rise in the FTSE 100 index of leading London shares was led by housebuilders in anticipation of changes to planning law but Labour’s economic plans are modest and cautious. It has ruled out big increases in spending and taxes and will be subject to rules governing how much it can borrow. This is neither 1945, when a Labour government came to power on a radical socialist manifesto, nor 2017, when a victory for Jeremy Corbyn certainly would have caused a stir in the markets. Rachel Reeves has spent a lot of time convincing the City that she will be a safe pair of hands as chancellor and it has paid off. The final reason for the serene response in the markets to Labour’s win is the belief that the worst is over for the economy. A global pandemic and the energy crisis prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have meant the period since 2019 has been something of an economic horror show. The Conservatives have been severely punished for presiding over the highest inflation in 40 years, the higher mortgage rates that resulted from Liz Truss’s disastrous premiership, and for living standards being lower at the end of the last parliament than they were at its start. Without question, the election was a rejection of the Conservatives rather than a strong endorsement for Labour. The scars from the coronavirus pandemic have not yet fully healed but the impact of the cost of living crisis is fading. Growth is picking up and inflation is back to its 2% target. Real incomes are rising and the Bank of England will soon start to cut interest rates, perhaps as early as next month. In the event of another adverse shock on the scale of Covid-19 or a war in eastern Europe, Labour’s economic plans would be thrown into chaos. But, on the assumption that there is nothing else nasty lurking out there, the financial markets think things are looking up for the UK, and that cautious optimism explains why they are so chilled about Sir Keir Starmer moving into 10 Downing Street.",

        "content": "Shell has warned investors that it will take an impairment charge of up to $2bn (£1.6bn) in its next set of results after it was forced to halt work on Europe’s largest biofuel project and sell off a Singapore refinery. The oil company told investors to expect a non-cash writedown of between $600m and $1bn when it publishes its second-quarter results next month because of trouble at a major biofuel project in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The company also expects to take a hit of between $600m and $800m on the Singapore refining and chemicals hub that it agreed to sell in May. The company’s share price edged down 0.8% on Friday, making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100. Shell announced on Tuesday that it had “temporarily paused” the construction of a big biofuel plant in Rotterdam, which was expected to convert waste into green jet fuel and biodiesel by the end of the decade. The oil company’s biggest energy transition project has struggled with technical difficulties that have delayed its progress so far. It had expected to start producing up to 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year in April, before this was pushed back to 2025. “We’re taking the tough decision now to temporarily pause on-site construction,” a Shell spokesperson said on Tuesday. “This gives us the opportunity to take stock, complete engineering, optimise project sequencing and, in doing so, maintain capital discipline.” The spokesperson added: “Low-carbon fuels form a key part of Shell’s ambitions to provide affordable and sustainable products to our customers.” The writedown marks another worrying sign for the development of sustainable aviation fuel, which is seen by some as crucial if airlines are to cut their carbon emissions in line with global climate targets. Last month, BP said it was scaling back its plans for the development of new SAF and renewable diesel biofuels projects at its existing sites. It set out plans to pause two potential projects while continuing to assess the viability of another three. BP said the decision was aligned with the oil company’s drive to “simplify its portfolio, focusing on value and returns”.",

        "title": "Pound holds steady after exit poll predicts Labour landslide victory",
        "content": "The pound held steady after exit polls showed Keir Starmer’s Labour on track for a landslide election victory, as investors bet that a decisive win would bring stability to Britain after years of political and economic uncertainty. Since Rishi Sunak called the snap general election in the pouring rain outside Downing Street six weeks ago, financial markets have widely expected Labour to win a crushing victory. Opinion polls have shown the party heading for one of the largest majorities in modern political history. Anything other than a resounding Labour victory would have been a major shock after predictions among City traders for a night of relative calm on the currency markets, with dealing rooms across the Square Mile focused not on whether the party would win but on the scale of Starmer’s landslide. Ahead of official results expected in the early hours of Friday morning, the exit poll suggested Labour was on course to win a majority of 170. Starmer’s expected majority is likely to solidify financial market expectations for a period of stability in British politics after years of turmoil under the Conservatives since the 2016 Brexit vote, when the shock leave outcome triggered a crash in the pound. After four prime ministers in five years, sterling has recovered from a record low of $1.03 in 2022, when Liz Truss’s mini budget triggered a meltdown in financial markets that required the Bank of England to intervene to prevent pension funds from going bust. The pound had been one of the strongest-performing currencies across major economies in recent weeks in anticipation of the result. The pound remained steady after the publication of exit polls on Thursday, with sterling trading unchanged on levels earlier in the day at about $1.27. Labour under Starmer has also shifted to the economic centre ground, aiming to distance the party from the more radical policies of Jeremy Corbyn after the former leader suffered a heavy defeat to Boris Johnson’s Tories in 2019. Analysts said a Labour majority below triple digits could have drawn a reaction in financial markets. Traders were also focused on whether Nigel Farage’s Reform party might win a sizeable number of seats, as a potential indicator of future political pressures on Starmer over the EU and immigration. The exit poll predicted that Reform would win 13 seats. Starmer has sought to maintain a cautious approach to economic policy after Labour’s 2019 defeat, when Corbyn promised a far-reaching transformation of the economy, and after Truss’s ill-fated economic experiment. UK government borrowing costs have remained steady on international markets in the run-up to Thursday’s poll, in contrast with a sharp rise in French bond yields over uncertainty around the outcome of the snap elections called by Emmanuel Macron. Investors said uncertainty about the outcome of the US presidential election in November had also bolstered appetite for UK assets, and there was talk of the country becoming a relative safe haven for investors in an increasingly volatile world. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the online trading platform IG, said: “The exit poll has provoked little volatility in FX markets, as the expected Labour landslide is duly predicted. The stability that would be provided by such a win would mean investors can cross ‘UK political risk’ off their list of worries for the time being. The focus now shifts across the Channel to France, where Sunday night’s election could have bigger ramifications.”",

        "content": "Global shares have continued the rally seen in recent days, cheered by optimism over US interest rate cuts (sparked by weaker US data and remarks by Fed chief Jerome Powell on Tuesday). As the UK goes to the polls, the FTSE 100 index has gained 1%, or 82 points, to 8253. It is the biggest riser among the main European stock markets today, followed by France, up 0.8%, Italy, up 0.7% and Germany, up 0.4%. US markets are closed for a national holiday. The pound is steady as we await the outcome of the UK’s general election, with exit polls at 1pm. It is trading at $1.2748 against the dollar, and at €1.1807 against the euro. There are hopes that political wrangling in France to stop Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally winning an outright majority in parliament can succeed, after more than 200 candidates pulled out of Sunday’s legislative election runoff to avoid splitting the anti-far-right vote. France’s prime minister Gabriel Attal said yesterday: “We can avoid an absolute majority for the far right,” adding that 90% of candidates from President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist camp had quit three-way races if they were in third with an RN candidate ahead of them. The UK’s construction sector continued to expand in June, although it lost some momentum amid a fresh fall in housebuilding, according to a survey. In stark contrast, construction in the eurozone remains mired in recession, according to a separate survey. Construction activity shrank at a faster rate last month, with German companies posting the biggest slump. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. I’ll be back at 6am tomorrow. Bye! – JK The muted market reaction to the prospect of a Labour party victory in the UK’s general election is evident even in energy commodity markets today, where traders are not expecting to be caught out by any surprises. “Election results look quite certain,” one trader told the Guardian. “Commodity traders won’t be working past 5pm.” The potential for Labour’s manifesto points to translate into price movements appears limited, according to Robbie Jackson-Stroud, an analyst at commodities data provider ICIS. Jackson-Stroud said that any policies designed to spur the development and construction of new energy capacity requires time to agree upon at a policy level, as well as planning and then construction. He added that “cost constraints in the current climate are the driver of investment in renewable capacity, and a change of party does not shift that.” But the commodity market’s underwhelming response to a potential Labour government has had one exception: the UK’s market for carbon credits. Traders have placed record bets that the price of UK carbon allowances, known as UKAs, would rise on the basis that a future Labour government would bring in tougher climate policies making it more expensive to pollute. “UKA prices have already rallied on expectation of improved green policies and the possibility that the UK’s carbon market may link with the EU market under a Labour government,” the trader said. The benchmark UKA price climbed to highs of £50 a tonne in the weeks after the election was announced, from lows of £31 a tonne earlier this year. On Thursday the price reached an intra-day high of £46.30 a tonne. The 4.2% drop in the Novo Nordisk share price this week has wiped nearly £15bn off its market value, reducing it to £370bn. The success of its weight loss treatments has turned it into Denmark’s, and Europe’s, most valuable company. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis has also looked at the eye study. Whilst the paper in question does indeed suggest some correlation with a rare ocular event, the quality of the evidence is very low, the error bars are very wide, we note the lack of prior identification suggests this would be a relatively rare issue (far rarer than stats in this paper would imply…) and the worst case scenario would likely be a further update to the label warning section – hardly a game-changer. As an aside, we also remain relaxed on the pricing outlook, within the context of the damage that has already been done by the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]. Shares in Novo Nordisk, and US rival Eli Lilly, have also come under pressure after Joe Biden attacked the company’s pricing for weight loss drugs this week. The companies are charging “unconscionably high prices” that are above those paid in other countries, Biden wrote in an editorial with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders published in USA Today on Tuesday. If “pharmaceutical companies refuse to substantially lower prescription drug prices in our country and end their greed, we will do everything within our power to end it for them,” they wrote. Shares in Novo Nordisk, the maker of the bestselling diabetes and weight loss injections Ozempic and Wegovy, have fallen more than 4% this week, after a study suggested that there could be a link between those treatments and vision loss. The shares are down 4.2% so far this week, but have somewhat recovered to trade 0.8% higher today. People who have been prescribed a weight-loss injection could be at a higher risk of developing an eye condition which can lead to blindness, the study found. The study, published yesterday, found that people with diabetes who were prescribed semaglutide, most commonly known under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic, were more than four times more likely to be diagnosed with an eye condition known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (naion). Naion is a disorder in which the arteries which supply blood to the optic nerve in the eye become blocked. The condition can lead to loss of eyesight due to the optic nerve being deprived of oxygen and subsequently damaged. There is no known treatment for the condition, which affects 10 out of 100,000 people in the general population. Jakob Westh Christensen, market analyst at eToro said Considering that over 50% of Novo Nordisk’s sales are attributed to these two blockbuster drugs and with a promising projected growth trajectory, any significant issues with the drugs could pose a threat to earnings and stock prices. However, the relatively minor market reaction indicates that investors are not overly concerned about this initial study. With a high valuation at nearly 40 times pprice/earnings, it is evident that the market has great expectations for Novo Nordisk’s earnings growth in the year ahead. This growth is largely based on their GLP-1 diabetes and weight-loss treatments, which are currently under scrutiny. This growth journey is supported by yet another uplift to management’s 2024 outlook in connection with Q1-results, which now expects operating profit to grow 22-30%. However, it is important to note that this study is relatively small and has limited statistical power. The findings do not prove that the medications caused the eye complications, which are commonly associated with diabetes. To establish any connection properly, a much larger study must be conducted. As retail investors who hold Novo Nordisk stock, it is advisable to monitor this situation closely. Any significant threat to these highly successful drugs would constitute a significant setback to Novo Nordisk’s growth journey. Russ Mould at AJ Bell has also looked at the medical equipment maker Smith &amp; Nephew, Andy Murray’s artificial hipmaker, which is leading FTSE 100 gains here in London. The shares jumped more than 8% after the activist investor Cevian Capital, a Swedish investment firm, disclosed a stake of around 5%. Activist investors often circle a struggling company so the news Sweden’s Cevian has taken a stake in medical devices firm Smith &amp; Nephew shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. Cevian has previously taken positions in UBS, Vodafone and Aviva in an attempt to force change and the case for doing so at Smith &amp; Nephew is presented by a near-40% decline in the share price over the last five years. Ian Cowie, columnist at the Sunday Times and interactive investor, said on X: The positive share price reaction to Cevian taking a position in Smith &amp; Nephew demonstrates the market thinks an outside catalyst for a shake-up of the business would be no bad thing. The company was severely affected by the pandemic as elective procedures like hip and knee replacements were cancelled, reducing demand for its orthopaedic products. Lockdown also hit the company’s supply chain, as it did for many businesses. However, its post-Covid recovery has been faltering and an improvement plan announced in 2022 has not yet resulted in a material improvement in earnings and profitability. This hasn’t been helped by a weak showing in the US market. Cevian is likely to hold management’s feet to the fire and may look for more ambitious targets than set out under the existing improvement plan. It could also push for a rationalisation of the company’s portfolio, which encompasses sports medicine and wound care alongside orthopaedics. Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, has looked at today’s market moves. The FTSE 100 index has gained 80 points to 8251, up nearly 1% on the day, while European shares are also pushing higher. France’s CAC has climbed 0.8% ahead of the second round of elections on Sunday. The FTSE 100 made a strong start on election day but its gains had far more to do with events on the other side of the Atlantic. Broad-based gains across the index followed weak jobs data from the US and a soft reading from the country’s services sector. This was taken as an indication the Federal Reserve may start cutting interest rates sooner rather than later, with the labour market closely watched by Jerome Powell and his colleagues. The dollar fell which, along with the shifting rate expectations, helped power Asian markets to big gains, with one broad-based Asian index reaching its highest level in more than two years. Dominant regional name Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company traded above one thousand Taiwanese dollars for the first time. Closer to home, there was some relief that mainstream parties appeared to be mounting a concerted effort to thwart the far-right Rassemblement National’s hopes of gaining a majority in the French parliament. Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at the trading platform Capital.com, said if we get a government change after 14 years of Tory leadership as suggested by opinion polls, “the market reaction is likely to be slightly muted given the outcome is mostly priced in”. The majority of the momentum will come from investors’ perception that the Labour Party can keep to its pledge to keep a lid on public spending and manage the national debt while putting the country back on the path towards stable economic growth. In particular, the plans to increase the supply of housing could benefit FTSE 100-listed housing stocks (Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Berkeley Group, etc.). Turning to the pound, she said: Barring any surprises which could bring volatility to markets, the pound may attempt to build on the pre-election rally of the last two days. But it is likely that it encounters resistance up ahead, especially as the focus remains on the Bank of England and its policy mandate, which has given no clear signs of when it will be able to start cutting rates. Markets are hopeful of a September start, but ongoing concerns about wage pressures in the services sector are keeping the central bank from making a move just yet. How these policy expectations evolve will likely have a bigger impact on the pound in the coming weeks than the election. Overall, the momentum in UK assets should not change much after the UK general election if things go as planned. As we’ve seen from the political turmoil in France, the less political friction there is the better the market will react. There is no denying that a new government will face significant challenges up ahead and that can weigh on UK assets further down the line, but for now, a seemingly calm election should anchor UK stocks and keep the pound relatively calm. Employers in the UK expect their wage bills to grow more slowly over the coming 12 months, according to a survey that should give the Bank of England more confidence to cut interest rates in the next few months. The central bank’s own Decision Maker Panel survey showed anticipated year-ahead wage growth fell by 0.3 percentage points to 4.2% in the three months to June. It was the lowest reading since the survey started in May 2022. The official measure of earnings growth has been too high for policymakers’ liking, and also fed into stubbornly high services inflation. But this survey suggests that wage growth could cool in the coming months. There is no basis for China to retaliate, as the European Union prepares to impose fresh tariffs of up to 37.6% on imports of electric vehicles made in China, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said today, in an interview with Bloomberg News. The EU tariffs, which range between 17.4% and 37.6%, will apply from tomorrow, according to EU officials. They are aimed at stemming what European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has described as a flood of cheap Chinese-made EVs built with state subsidies. However, there is a four-month window during which the duties are only provisional and intense talks are expected to continue between the two sides. At the end of the period, the Commission, the EU’s executive arm, could impose “definite duties” that typically apply for five years, on which EU members would vote. Dombrovskis said: Our aim is to… ensure fair competition and level playing field. Therefore, once again, we do not see any basis for retaliation. Those talks with China are ongoing and indeed should a mutually beneficial solution emerge, we can also find ways not to apply at the end of the day the tariffs. The provisional rates are almost exactly those announced by the Commission on 12 June. Beijing said at the time that it would take “all necessary measures” to safeguard China’s interests. These could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of European products such as cognac and pork. Germany’s Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker, is opposed to the tariffs. It said: The timing of the EU Commission’s decision is detrimental to the current weak demand for BEVs [battery electric vehicles] in Germany and Europe. The negative effects of this decision outweigh any benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry. The Volkswagen Group is confidently accepting growing international competition, including from China, and sees this as an opportunity – this also benefits our customers. The owner of the Jeep, Fiat and Vauxhall brands, Stellantis, has also come out against the proposed tariffs. Its chief executive, Carlos Tavares, has criticised the duties and said the world’s fourth biggest carmaker preferred to “fight to stay competitive”. The Shanghai-based electric carmaker Nio said: At this stage, Nio maintains the pricing of its current models in its European markets. however, it cannot be ruled out that prices may be adjusted at a later stage as a result of these tariffs being imposed. Despite these developments, Nio is fully committed to the European market: we believe in fostering competition and consumer interest, and we hope to reach a resolution with the EU before definitive measures are enforced in November. The British banking sector has called for the next government to penalise startups that take state aid and then list abroad amid concerns about young companies choosing foreign stock exchanges over London. UK Finance suggested subsidies and tax breaks could be clawed back, arguing in a paper published this week that companies that receive government help should have “a two-way commitment”. British businesspeople and City grandees have warned for several years that London’s stock market is in decline relative to other exchanges, notably in the US, where some fast-growing companies have said it is easier to attract investments. Recent departures from the London Stock Exchange have included the building materials company CRH, the betting company Flutter and the plumbing products company Ferguson. However, perhaps most galling for the LSE was the failure to attract the huge stock market flotation of the Cambridge-headquartered chip designer Arm, which plumped for New York despite the personal lobbying of Rishi Sunak. The pound is steady, as voters head to the polls across the UK. World stocks have extended the rally seen in recent days, as weak US data and remarks from US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell on Tuesday fuelled hopes of interest rate cuts from the Fed. Markets are now pricing in a 74% probability of a reduction in September, up from 65%. There were fresh record highs on the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the wider S&amp;P 500 on Wall Street last night, as chipmaker Nvidia and electric carmaker Tesla notched up further strong gains. Asia-Pacific shares rose nearly 1% to reach their highest level since April 2022. Over here, the FTSE 100 index is 62 points or 0.77% ahead at 8,233. The German market is 0.3% ahead while the French and Italian indices have climbed around 0.7% each. Trading is thin today with US markets closed for a holiday, and investors holding back as they want to see how large a majority the Labour party might get in the UK, with exit polls coming out at 10pm BST. Opinion polls have for months pointed to a landslide victory for Labour, and it has been priced in by financial markets. The pound is up 0.1% against the dollar at $1.2753, and a smidgen lower against the euro at €1.1808. Michael Metcalfe, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, said: Having been very negative of sterling for a very long time, institutional investors are actually going into this election quite neutral. Political risk has soared in France, which holds the second round of elections on Sunday and where political wrangling is underway to try and stop Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party getting a majority in parliament; also in the United States ahead of its presidential vote in November. Metcalfe said The UK, oddly, has ended up with a neutral position in the middle. Also, I don’t think at any. point has the result [of the election] been in an doubt. In stark contrast, construction in the eurozone remains mired in recession, according to a separate survey. Construction activity shrank at a faster rate last month, with German companies posting the biggest slump. The PMI from Hamburg Commercial Bank dropped to 41.8 in June from 42.9 in May, signalling a marked contraction in output across the construction sector. The rate of decline was the second-strongest since mid-2020, surpassed only by that seen in January. German firms faced the greatest decline in performance, even though the contraction in output eased to the least marked since August 2023. At the same time, bigger reductions were observed in the French and Italian construction sectors, with the former seeing its sharpest fall in output since March, and the latter posting its strongest drop in nearly two years. Employment levels fell further as companies laid off workers. Tariq Kamal Chaudhry, economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: The eurozone construction sector is stuck in a recession with no clear path to recovery. The setbacks in the three largest economies in the zone—Germany, France, and Italy—have been particularly severe this month. Subsector activity shows that residential construction remains the weakest, though there was a slight softening in the pace of decline compared to the previous month. The most significant negative correction from May occurred in civil engineering activity. Inflation is slowly but surely cooling down. Since the peak in July 2021, input price pressures in the eurozone’s construction sector have been on a downward trend, which continued in June. Further reductions in price growth are likely as demand in the construction sector remains extremely weak. Additionally, subcontractor prices rose at a slower rate, although they are still growing moderately. He said the outlook “offers little encouragement” and that weakening inflationary pressures alone won’t do -- interest rate cuts are needed from the European Central Bank. However, caution currently prevails at the ECB, and according to HCOB Economics, only one additional interest rate cut is expected well into 2025. This is insufficient to make a significant impact. Therefore, it is understandable that the expectations of surveyed constructors remain in contraction territory. The UK’s construction sector continued to expand in June, although it lost some momentum amid a fresh fall in housebuilding, according to a survey. A slower rise in new orders was also recorded, in some cases linked to election uncertainty, but the pace of job creation picked up. Meanwhile, the rate of firms’ input cost inflation accelerated from May, but remained muted. The headline S&amp;P Global UK construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 52.2 from 54.7 in May, but remained above the 50 no-change mark that separates expansion from contraction for the fourth month running. The main driver of growth continued to come from commercial activity, which increased markedly again in June. That said, the rate of expansion softened from May’s two-year high. Civil engineering activity also slowed. The only area to record a drop in activity was housing, where output fell again following the first increase in 19 months during May. Andrew Harker, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: Continued growth of the UK construction sector in June meant that the sector has recorded sustained expansion throughout the second quarter of the year. While there were signs of a slowdown in the latest survey period, most notably around housing activity, firms indicated that a slowdown in new order growth was in part related to election uncertainty. We may therefore see trends improve once the election period comes to an end. Moreover, confidence in the year ahead outlook remained strong and firms increased employment to the largest extent in ten months. In terms of inflation, there remains little sign of cost pressures picking up to any great extent, encouraging firms to expand purchasing activity. Supply-chain conditions also remained favourable. The UK new car market has hit the half-year million motors mark for the first time in five years, after new car registrations rose in June by a modest 1.1% to reach 179,263 vehicles, according to new figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). As a result, 1,006,763 new cars have been sold so far this year, up 6% year-on-year but still down 20.7% on 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. June’s market growth was driven primarily by the fleet sector, where uptake rose by 14.2%, while demand from private buyers fell for the ninth consecutive month, down 15.3%. Demand for electric vehicles grew “robustly” in June, with plug-in hybrid volumes up by 30% to reach a 9.3% market share, while hybrid electric vehicles rose by 27.2% to take 14.9% of the market. Both powertrains also outpaced battery electric vehicle growth, which rose by 7.4% and took its highest monthly share this year, accounting for 19% of all new vehicle registrations. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: The year’s midpoint sees the new car market in its best state since 2021 – but this belies the bigger challenge ahead. The private consumer market continues to shrink against a difficult economic backdrop, but with the right policies in place, the next government can re-energise the market and deliver a faster, fairer zero emission transition. All parties are agreed on the need to cut carbon and replacing older fossil fuel based technologies with new electrified powertrains is the essential step to achieving that goal. The artificial hips and knees maker Smith &amp; Nephew is the top riser on the FTSE 100 index this morning, climbing more than 6%, after the Swedish investment firm Cevian Capital, known as an activist investor, disclosed a stake of about 5% in the company. Barclays shares gained 1.6% after the British bank said it had agreed to sell its German consumer finance business to Germany’s BAWAG Group for a “small premium to net assets” in cash. As the UK heads to the polls in parliamentary elections that could end 14 years of Conservatives in government and see Labour leader Keir Starmer installed as prime minister, Gervais Williams, head of equities at the London fund manager Premier Miton, has looked at what this may mean for the economy. He told Reuters: Both parties are quite similar in economic policies. There will be some change, but most of it is continuity when you compare with what’s happening in France or Germany. The UK is actually an island of economic stability relative to the other elections going on around. Trading activity is expected to be muted because US markets are closed for Independence Day. Here is our full story on new car sales in the UK: Carmakers have sold more than a million cars in the UK in the first half of the year for the first time since before the coronavirus pandemic as the sector gradually recovers from years of turmoil. Preliminary data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the UK industry’s lobby group, suggested that the industry would sell about 2m cars over the year, also for the first time since 2019. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said that 2m sales for the year would be “a bit below par” but that the recovery was a relief for the industry after years of struggles. However, the growth was “almost entirely business and fleet sales” rather than private buyers, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Given that most people buy with some kind of finance, with inflation high and interest rates high, it has made the cost of purchase more expensive.” More than 20,000 Tesco staff, mainly shopfloor workers in stores and distribution centres, will share in a windfall profit of more than £30m after share savings schemes have matured. The windfall is created by the strong growth of the Tesco share price, which was £3.06 earlier this week. Those who joined the schemes are able to buy shares at a discounted price of just £1.88 or £1.98 each and either hold on to them, or sell them and make a profit on each share. A Tesco shopfloor worker who invested the average £68 a month for the last five years stands to pocket around £6,640 from their £4,080 investment, a profit of £2,560, Tesco said. The news comes just weeks after Tesco’s chief executive Ken Murphy came under fire for his near-£10m annual pay package. Emma Taylor, Tesco’s chief people officer, said: It’s great news that more than 20,000 colleagues will benefit this year from our share schemes. This is just one of the many benefits available to our colleagues, and the strong performance of the schemes this year is a reflection of their hard work and the brilliant job that they do serving our customers every day. The FTSE 100 index has opened about 50 points higher at 8,222, a 0.6% gain, as millions across the UK head to the polls. The ballot boxes close at 10pm this evening. Other major European stock markets are also making further gains, partly on the back of optimism about US rate cuts in recent days, and hopes that a majority for Marine Le Pen’s far right party can be avoid in the second round of elections in France on Sunday. The German Dax is trading 0.4% higher, while the French CAC rose 0.7% and Italy’s FTSE MiB gained 0.5%. The US markets are closed today for Independence Day. Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Opinion polls are suggesting one of the biggest landslides the nation has ever seen for Labour, but they have been wrong before. In a shortened trading session ahead of today’s 4 July celebrations, investors have been digesting weak jobs data in the US. Private payroll growth came in at 150,000 for June, below analyst forecasts. And weekly jobless claims continued their upwards journey for the ninth week in a row. All eyes will now be on tomorrow’s non-farm payroll numbers. There was also weak data from the US services sector with the US ISM Services PMI falling 5 points sequentially in June to 48.8, way short of the 52.5 consensus expectation. Perhaps no surprise that 10-year Treasury yields lost 8 basis points to 4.355%. Conversely, the improving outlook for a Fed rate cut helped US equities breach new records, with the tech-based Nasdaq Composite up 0.9% to 18.188.30 and the broader S&amp;P 500 climbing by 0.5% to 5,537.02 last night. Microchipmaker Nvidia resumed its upwards trajectory, climbing 4.6% after some recent profit taking. And Tesla rose by a further 6.5% following the previous day’s 10.2% gain that was triggered by better than forecast vehicle deliveries. With the shares up over 40% in the last month, expectations are riding high ahead of earnings season. Brent Crude has given up some of yesterday’s gains, reflecting the weak US economic data, and is trading 0.8% lower. But the global benchmark still sits at close to $87 a barrel, supported by a sharp fall in US oil inventories, and concerns that Hurricane Beryl could disrupt production in the Gulf of Mexico. Hawes explained that the more common electric vehicles become, the more their price is going to come down, but there are limits – batteries are more expensive than in a traditional petrol or diesel car. As you develop these vehicles at scale, you can drive down these costs to a certain extent, but the raw materials, in particular, the battery is a lot more expensive. Of an electric vehicle that battery is about 40% of total cost of the car. The Red Sea disruption has added to cost pressures along with Russia’s war in Ukraine, he said. A number of our vehicles that are sold in the UK come from Asia. They’re no longer going through the Suez [canal]. They’re going around the Cape. That adds two to three weeks in terms of transit and back again. And obviously that adds cost. So that’s just yet another strain. How is demand for electric vehicles holding up, SMMT chief Mike Hawes was asked earlier. He said it was “OK” – adding that it will take time for electric cars to get into the mass market, and that the journey will be bumpy. It was OK in June, but what we have seen is something of a plateau flattening out. When these vehicles were first on the market, there really was high demand for them, because those were the early adopters. We need to get that from the early adopter phase into the mass market. That is never going to be smooth. So the manufacturers are doing all they can to stimulate that demand with really attractive deals. But given the economic conditions and the fact that these are still vehicles that are more expensive than petrol and diesel cars that preceded them, there is still something of a challenge. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It’s general election day in the UK. Voting has now begun and polling stations will be open until 10pm. Polling suggests it could bring an end to 14 years of the Conservative party in government, and lead to Labour opposition leader Keir Starmer being installed in Downing Street as the new prime minister. You can read more on our main election blog here: New car sales in the UK grew by 5% year on year in June, according to preliminary data from the industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders. It means that the number of new cars leaving forecourts has exceeded 1m in the first half of the year, the first time since 2019 it has passed that milestone. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said on BBC radio 4’s Today programme: It’s kind of a relief to get there. We know we’re clearly heading for around 2m new car sales this year, which is a bit below par. But obviously things are changing in terms of the number of vehicles potentially being bought. But to get there, given all the difficulties we’ve had over the last five years and indeed beyond that, it’s a real boost for the industry. It’s almost entirely business and fleet sales. There’s a number of reasons behind that. Obviously the backdrop of the economic conditions isn’t great, and households are on a squeeze. And most people, private buyers, tend to buy through finance with inflation high and interest rates high, it’s made the cost of purchase more expensive. But the carrot has been for the businesses, the incentives, the company car tax that is there for the fleet and the business buyer, has stimulated demand, especially for electrified vehicles. So that’s what’s really driving the growth. The market share of pure battery electric new cars remained on a par with last year, at around 16-17%. Final figures for June will be published by the SMMT at 9am. In Germany, factory orders fell unexpectedly in May, declining by 1.6% on the previous month. Economists had expected a rise of 0.5%. The minutes of the US Federal Reserve’s June meeting showed that policymakers acknowledged the US economy appeared to be slowing and that “price pressures were diminishing”. But they still opted for a wait-and-see approach before committing to interest rate cuts, according to minutes of the 11-12 June session. The minutes, which were released last night, noted a weak May reading in the consumer price index as one among “a number of developments in the product and labor markets” that supported a view that inflation was falling. Wage growth had slowed, some officials noted, while others pointed to price cutting among major retailers and reports from their own business contacts that “pricing power had declined.” However, policymakers concluded that more time and data was needed before they could decide on a rate cut. Officials “did not expect that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate until additional information had emerged to give them greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward” the 2% target, the minutes said.

        "title": "Cineworld ‘considers closing a quarter of its 100 UK cinemas’",
        "content": "Cineworld is reportedly considering closing a quarter of its UK cinemas as part of a wide-ranging restructure. The cinema operator, which delisted from the London Stock Exchange last year after its share price collapsed, is drawing up plans to shut as many as 25 cinemas and renegotiate rent agreements at 50 more of its 100 or so UK sites, sources told Sky News. The chain, which is being advised by the consultants Alix Partners, owns cinemas including the Picturehouse chain and employs thousands of people. The proposals were expected to be outlined formally to creditors, including landlords, in the coming weeks and the mechanism adopted by the cinema operator was expected to be a restructuring plan rather than a company voluntary arrangement, Sky reported. Cineworld said: “We continue to review our options but we don’t comment on rumours and speculation.” The debt-laden chain struggled during the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to enforced closure of its sites for months. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in 2022 and lodged a reorganisation plan with an American bankruptcy court from which it emerged last year. It tried to sell its US, UK and Irish businesses last year, but did not receive any acceptable offers. Cineworld was founded in 1995. It expanded under the leadership of the Greidinger family and later listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its acquisition of Regal Entertainment created the second largest cinema business in the world by number of screens, and it operates in central and eastern European markets including Poland and Hungary as well as Israel and the US. The restructuring comes as the sector continues its recovery from the lows of pandemic lockdowns. Tim Richards, the founder and chief executive of the cinema operator Vue International, told the BBC’s Wake up to Money programme that the industry had been recovering slowly after the pandemic but was hit again last year by the Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes, which affected film productions. The sector was still suffering from the impact of the stoppages, he said: “We are not going to see a return to post-pandemic levels until some time probably 12 months from now.” Vue had gone through a restructuring with shareholders last year and was now “in very very good shape”, he added. Richards said there were 35% fewer films released in 2022 than in the pre-pandemic era and 20% fewer in 2023. This compared with the period between 2017 and 2019 when there were three consecutive box office world records set, he said. “The pandemic hit and then we had a pretty slow recovery both in film production and as an industry … and then the strikes hit,” he said. “It could not have been a worse time. We have a supply issue and not a demand problem.”",

        "title": "Pubs furious at Co-op ad urging Euro 2024 fans to ‘stay in’ with a meal deal ",
        "content": "Publicans have called on the Co-op to pull a “disgraceful” TV advert that urges the supermarket’s customers to watch the Euro 2024 football tournament at home rather than going to the pub. The Co-op Food ad says it is hard to see the TV screen in the pub and suggests customers instead “stay in” and take advantage of a beer and pizza deal the supermarket is promoting. Publicans responded furiously, accusing the Co-op of going against its much-vaunted ethical credentials by deliberately targeting an industry that is already struggling. In a letter to Co-op’s chief executive, Shirine Khoury-Haq, the Campaign for Pubs group said people in the hospitality sector were “deeply angry” about the advert. “You and your management team must surely be aware of what a challenging time it is for pubs and publicans, yet here you are, a supposedly ethical business, openly and deliberately undermining pubs and publicans’ livelihoods at this difficult time,” it wrote. “At the time when businesses in England should be uniting in support of the national football team, the Co-op has instead cynically and shamelessly sought to attack another important business sector to try to boost your own profits from the tournament. It really goes against everything that the Co-op movement stands for. Who on earth thought this was an acceptable thing to do?” The group called on Khoury-Haq to remove the “utterly crass and divisive” advert and apologise to publicans. The British Institute of Innkeeping and the beer enthusiasts’ group Camra have also criticised the ad. The BII’s chief executive, Steve Alton, told the Morning Advertiser it was “incredibly disappointing”, and Camra’s chief executive, Tom Stainer, said he hoped the supermarket would not run it again. Supermarkets performed well during the pandemic, but the pub trade was badly hit by lengthy forced closures, which have had a lasting effect on an industry already battling decline. More than 500 pubs closed in the UK last year, according to the British Beer &amp; Pub Association, with many struggling to pay punishing rent and energy bills and the effect of the cost of living crisis on customers’ spending. Supermarkets also benefit from lower overheads on alcohol because they have much lower staff costs and can sell at artificially low prices as a “loss leader” to bring customers in, who then buy other products. A Co-op spokesperson said: “The 10 second advert is a light-hearted way of highlighting to our members and customers that, if they have made the choice to stay in to watch the football, we have a cracking pizza and beer deal they can purchase to enjoy in their homes, with the sole intention of providing great value on relevant products which customers tell us they want, especially at a time when the cost of living is high”.",

        "title": "EU brushes aside risk of China trade war over electric vehicle tariffs",
        "content": "The EU’s top trade official, Valdis Dombrovskis, has brushed aside concerns of trade-war retaliation from Beijing against European business, after the European Commission imposed duties on Chinese electric vehicles. Dombrovskis, a European Commission vice-president, told Bloomberg Television that talks with China were ongoing, adding: “We are not seeing the basis for retaliation as what we are conducting is indeed in line with WTO [World Trade Organization] rules.” Provisional tariffs on Chinese EV imports to the bloc ranging from 17.4% to 37.6% will apply from Friday, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on what the EU executive called “unfair” subsidies from Beijing. These tariffs – far lower than the 100% tariffs imposed by the US – will come on top of the EU’s existing 10% duty on electric vehicles from China. Europe’s biggest carmaker, Volkswagen, reiterated its criticism on Thursday of the commission’s proposed tariffs on EVs made in China, arguing that they would not strengthen Europe’s car industry in the long term. Volkswagen, which is grappling with falling market share in China, has previously warned of retaliation from Beijing. “The timing of the EU Commission’s decision is detrimental to the current weak demand for [battery electric vehicles] in Germany and Europe,” the company said on Thursday. Stellantis, owner of brands including Citroën, Fiat and Vauxhall, has said it will not take a defensive stance in the battle for electric car sales and preferred to “fight to stay competitive”. The tariffs are the result of an ongoing EU investigation launched last October, which found Chinese producers benefited from subsidies at every stage of production, from the mining of lithium used in batteries to shipping the vehicles to EU ports, such as Rotterdam and Antwerp. “Based on the investigation, the commission has concluded that the BEV [battery electric vehicle] value chain in China benefits from unfair subsidisation, which is causing a threat of economic injury to EU BEV producers,” it said in a statement to accompany a legal decision published on Thursday. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told Xi Jinping during the Chinese president’s recent visit to Europe that “imbalances” caused by state support for Chinese industry, leading to artificially cheap products, threatened jobs in Europe, which was “a matter of great concern”. China, which has said it is looking for a “mutually acceptable solution” to the dispute, is investigating French cognac and pork imports over subsidies, raising the prospect of tit-for-tat measures. “It is plain for all to see who is escalating trade frictions and instigating a ‘trade war’,” the Chinese commerce ministry said last month. China has won a 25% share of the EU market for electric-battery powered cars, up from 3% in 2020. EU officials fear that without action a European industry that employs 2.5 million people and 10.3 million in the wider supply chain could be seriously hurt, just as the EU saw its solar-panel companies lose out to subsidised Chinese competitors. From Friday, importers of Chinese vehicles into the EU will be required to give bank guarantees to customs officers to pay the duties. Money will be collected only if the commission concludes in the autumn that the car industry would have been harmed without these duties. A final decision on definitive duties – which would be in force for five years – will only be taken in the autumn, pending a vote by the EU’s 27 member states. Under the provisional measures, China’s BYD, which vies with Tesla for the spot of the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles, faces a tariff of 17.4%; Geely will pay 19.9% and SAIC 37.6%. The rates, calculated according to total subsidies and company turnover, have been modestly adjusted downwards in most cases since the required pre-disclosure of tariffs last month, after technical talks with the companies. The tariffs enter into force despite staunch opposition from Germany, Europe’s largest exporter to China. The German government has called for an “amicable solution”, but also said “serious movement is needed on the Chinese side”. German officials do not expect to reverse the measures, which can only be overturned by a weighted majority of 15 EU member states, representing 65% of the union’s population.",

        "title": "British electricity prices could hinder switch to green technology, says steel industry",
        "content": "British electricity prices were double those paid in France and Spain in the spring, with the steel industry saying the disadvantage could hinder UK efforts to switch to greener technology. UK companies paid nearly £66 per megawatt hour (MWh) for wholesale electricity in the second quarter of 2024, well over double the French and Spanish equivalents in the same period, according to analysis of industry data by the lobby group UK Steel. The gap between UK prices and those of Spain and France has widened to its largest since at least 2015, when the group started tracking price movements. During that time the UK has been consistently more expensive, except during the energy crisis sparked in 2022 by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, when prices were extremely volatile. The growing divergence between the UK and rivals’ electricity costs represents a big challenge for an expected Labour government, which has voiced full-throated support for the steel industry in switching to electric technology and away from polluting coal. It has pledged £3bn in subsidies. Within hours of polls in the UK general election closing on Thursday evening, Tata Steel will tap the last iron from one of its two blast furnaces at Port Talbot in south Wales after a closure process lasting several days. The Indian-owned company is planning to close its second blast furnace and the rest of its steel-making process in September before building a much cleaner electric arc furnace. The plans, which have been at the centre of a row with unions, involve as many as 2,800 job losses. Jonathan Reynolds, who will be business secretary if Labour wins the election, is expected to meet Tata Steel executives as soon as Monday to discuss government support for the company. The Conservative government agreed £500m in subsidies, but unions are hopeful that Labour will push for a deal that protects more jobs. Tata executives have said they will consider the business case for further investments which could save more jobs, although Labour has not said what it plans for the remainder of the promised £3bn. Relatively high energy prices in the UK, however, act as a brake on investment by heavy industry. Much of the European investment in steel innovation – such as making direct reduced iron using hydrogen – has been directed to Sweden, where there is abundant cheap hydropower. The average electricity prices for France and Spain were £26.68 and £27.89 respectively in the second quarter of 2024, according to UK Steel. The figures refer to wholesale prices only, and do not include policy levies and network charges. French costs have been helped by the return to service of several nuclear power plants, while Spain has used abundant solar power. Executives in energy-intensive industries ranging from steel and glass to ceramics and chemicals have long complained that UK electricity costs leave them at a significant disadvantage relative to their European rivals. UK plants and factories often compete directly with EU counterparts for investments. UK Steel’s energy and climate change policy manager, Frank Aaskov, said: “The steel industry is the foundation of the UK’s manufacturing and economic strengths. We must not lose sight of how important electricity costs are in the move to green steel as we fully switch to electric arc furnace technology to secure steel for our nation. “The UK steel industry cannot continue to face electricity prices that are more than double what our main European competitors benefit from. For the UK steel industry to prosper and deliver on its decarbonisation targets, a new government must deliver the lowest electricity prices in Europe.” The government has taken some action to reduce industrial energy costs, including the so-called supercharger policy which cuts levies funding renewable energy for some big electricity users. Room for manoeuvre is limited, however, because UK electricity prices are closely related to prices for methane burned in power stations.",

        "title": "Penalise startups that take state aid then list abroad, says UK Finance",
        "content": "The British banking sector has called for the next government to penalise startups that take state aid and then list abroad amid concerns about young companies choosing foreign stock exchanges over London. UK Finance suggested subsidies and tax breaks could be clawed back, arguing in a paper published this week that companies in receipt of government help should have “a two-way commitment”. British businesspeople and City grandees have said for several years that London’s stock market is in decline relative to other exchanges, notably in the US, where some fast-growing companies have said it is easier to attract investments. Recent departures from the London Stock Exchange have included the building materials company CRH, the betting company Flutter and the plumbing products company Ferguson. Perhaps most galling for the LSE, however, was the failure to attract the huge flotation of the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm, which plumped for New York despite the personal lobbying of Rishi Sunak. In a paper co-written by Global Counsel, the lobbying consultancy set up by the former Labour business minister Peter Mandelson, UK Finance suggested commitments to stay in the UK in exchange for government support could help to arrest the movement of companies abroad. “The government should also consider ways in which an expanded set of taxpayer-funded supports for early-stage growth companies involve a two-way commitment and would become repayable in part or full if a recipient ultimately chooses to list, or move valuable operations, outside the UK,” it wrote. “Where a UK company chooses to join public markets or locate is a choice for the company. However, there is a strong case for linking taxpayer supports to future commitments to using UK public markets and operating in the UK.” Regulators, politicians and executives have prescribed various remedies for the perceived exodus. The Financial Conduct Authority last year unveiled sweeping reforms to make it easier for startup founders to keep controlling stakes, apeing the US. The chief executive of the LSE, Julia Hoggett, argued last year that UK companies were not on a “level playing field” because British asset managers tended to vote against larger, US-style pay packages. Conor Lawlor, the managing director for capital markets and wholesale policy at UK Finance, said: “We want to see UK companies grow and be hugely successful. We also want to bolster our capital markets and the number of companies that choose to list on UK markets. Our aim is to make the UK as attractive a destination as possible. “We have set out a range of ideas for discussion, including giving enhanced government support to growing companies, and also looking at whether that support could incentivise a UK listing. Where a UK company chooses to list will of course always be a choice for that individual company.” The banking body also suggested tapering early-stage government support for startups, rather than cutting it off abruptly when they reach a certain size, and said there could be benefits to making it easier for pension funds to invest in unlisted UK companies. There were 2,101 companies listed on London’s main market in 2003, but that figure has fallen to 1,022, according to LSE data.",

        "title": "First-half sales of new cars in UK pass 1m for first time since before Covid",
        "content": "Carmakers have sold more than a million cars in the UK in the first half of the year for the first time since before the coronavirus pandemic as the sector gradually recovers from years of turmoil. Sales in the first six months of 2024 rose by 6% to just over 1m, compared with 949,000 in the same period last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the UK industry’s lobby group. The share of electric cars hit 19% in June, its highest this year. The SMMT suggested that the industry would sell about 2m cars over the year, also for the first time since 2019. Its chief executive, Mike Hawes, said that annual total would be “a bit below par” but that the recovery was a relief for the industry after years of struggles. However, the growth was “almost entirely business and fleet sales” rather than private buyers, Hawes told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Given that most people buy with some kind of finance, with inflation high and interest rates high, it has made the cost of purchase more expensive.” Sales to private buyers fell for the ninth consecutive month, and were down 12% in the first half of the year compared with 2023. Annual car sales peaked in 2016 at a record 2.69m. After that they fell for three years – albeit remaining well above 2m – until they plunged in 2020 as the pandemic forced factories to pause production and prevented people from visiting showrooms for months. That was followed by years of supply-chain turmoil. Sales picked up to 1.9m in 2023, although that was still the weakest barring the pandemic years since before the global financial crisis of 2008. The rise of electric vehicles has also been a complicating factor for the industry, which must now sell more zero-emissions cars or else face steep fines. However, European manufacturers have complained that they are struggling to find buyers for their electric cars, which they have priced higher than petrol or diesel equivalents in order to cover the cost of batteries. Vauxhall, Peugeot and Fiat’s owner Stellantis last week threatened to close its UK factories because of the so-called zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate. The market share of pure battery electric new cars remained about the same in the first half of 2024 as last year, at 16.6%, the SMMT said. In the first half of 2023 it was 16.1%. Hawes said that “we have seen is something of a plateau flattening out” in demand for electric cars. “When these vehicles were first on the market, there really was high demand for them, because those were the early adopters,” he added. “We need to get that from the early-adopter phase into the mass market. That is never going to be smooth.” Carmakers had sold 827,000 cars in the first five months of the year, a 7% increase on 2023.",

        "title": "Can the climate survive the insatiable energy demands of the AI arms race?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence boom has driven big tech share prices to fresh highs, but at the cost of the sector’s climate aspirations. Google admitted on Tuesday that the technology is threatening its environmental targets after revealing that datacentres, a key piece of AI infrastructure, had helped increase its greenhouse gas emissions by 48% since 2019. It said “significant uncertainty” around reaching its target of net zero emissions by 2030 – reducing the overall amount of CO2 emissions it is responsible for to zero – included “the uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict”. It follows Microsoft, the biggest financial backer of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, admitting that its 2030 net zero “moonshot” might not succeed owing to its AI strategy. So will tech be able to bring down AI’s environmental cost, or will the industry plough on regardless because the prize of supremacy is so great? Why does AI pose a threat to tech companies’ green goals? Datacentres are a core component of training and operating AI models such as Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s GPT-4. They contain the sophisticated computing equipment, or servers, that crunch through the vast reams of data underpinning AI systems. They require large amounts of electricity to run, which generates CO2 depending on the energy source, as well as creating “embedded” CO2 from the cost of manufacturing and transporting the necessary equipment. According to the International Energy Agency, total electricity consumption from datacentres could double from 2022 levels to 1,000 TWh (terawatt hours) in 2026, equivalent to the energy demand of Japan, while research firm SemiAnalysis calculates that AI will result in datacentres using 4.5% of global energy generation by 2030. Water usage is significant too, with one study estimating that AI could account for up to 6.6bn cubic metres of water use by 2027 – nearly two-thirds of England’s annual consumption. What do experts say about the environmental impact? A recent UK government-backed report on AI safety said that the carbon intensity of the energy source used by tech firms is “a key variable” in working out the environmental cost of the technology. It adds, however, that a “significant portion” of AI model training still relies on fossil fuel-powered energy. Indeed, tech firms are hoovering up renewable energy contracts in an attempt to meet their environmental goals. Amazon, for instance, is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy. Some experts argue, though, that this pushes other energy users into fossil fuels because there is not enough clean energy to go round. “Energy consumption is not just growing, but Google is also struggling to meet this increased demand from sustainable energy sources,” says Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a website monitoring the environmental impact of new technologies. Is there enough renewable energy to go round? Global governments plan to triple the world’s renewable energy resources by the end of the decade to cut consumption of fossil fuels in line with climate targets. But the ambitious pledge, agreed at last year’s COP28 climate talks, is already in doubt and experts fear that a sharp increase in energy demand from AI datacentres may push it further out of reach. The IEA, the world’s energy watchdog, has warned that even though global renewable energy capacity grew by the fastest pace recorded in the past 20 years in 2023, the world may only double its renewable energy by 2030 under current government plans. The answer to AI’s energy appetite may be for tech companies to invest more heavily in building new renewable energy projects to meet their growing power demand. How soon can we build new renewable energy projects? Onshore renewable energy projects such as wind and solar farms are relatively fast to build – they can take less than six months to develop. However, sluggish planning rules in many developed countries alongside a global logjam in connecting new projects to the power grid could add years to the process. Offshore windfarms and hydro power schemes face similar challenges in addition to construction times of between two and five years. This has raised concerns over whether renewable energy can keep pace with the expansion of AI. Major tech companies have already tapped a third of US nuclear power plants to supply low-carbon electricity to their datacentres, according to the Wall Street Journal. But without investing in new power sources these deals would divert low-carbon electricity away from other users leading to more fossil fuel consumption to meet overall demand. Will AI’s demand for electricity grow for ever? Normal rules of supply and demand would suggest that, as AI uses more electricity, the cost of energy rises and the industry is forced to economise. But the unique nature of the industry means that the largest companies in the world may instead decide to plough through spikes in the cost of electricity, burning billions of dollars as a result. The largest and most expensive datacentres in the AI sector are those used to train “frontier” AI, systems such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 which are more powerful and capable than any other. The leader in the field has changed over the years, but OpenAI is generally near the top, battling for position with Anthropic, maker of Claude, and Google’s Gemini. Already, the “frontier” competition is thought to be “winner takes all”, with very little stopping customers from jumping to the latest leader. That means that if one business spends $100m on a training run for a new AI system, its competitors have to decide to spend even more themselves or drop out of the race entirely. Worse, the race for so-called “AGI”, AI systems that are capable of doing anything a person can do, means that it could be worth spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a single training run – if doing so led your company to monopolise a technology that could, as OpenAI says, “elevate humanity”. Won’t AI firms learn to use less electricity? Every month, there are new breakthroughs in AI technology that enables companies to do more with less. In March 2022, for instance, a DeepMind project called Chinchilla showed researchers how to train frontier AI models using radically less computing power, by changing the ratio between the amount of training data and the size of the resulting model. But that didn’t result in the same AI systems using less electricity; instead, it resulted in the same amount of electricity being used to make even better AI systems. In economics, that phenomenon is known as “Jevons’ paradox”, after the economist who noted that the improvement of the steam engine by James Watt, which allowed for much less coal to be used, instead led to a huge increase in the amount of the fossil fuel burned in England. As the price of steam power plummeted following Watt’s invention, new uses were discovered that wouldn’t have been worthwhile when power was expensive.",

        "title": "Is Shein really worth £50bn? Reasons to be sceptical are piling up",
        "content": "A stock market listing for Shein has been talked about for so long that the round number of £50bn has become attached to this Chinese-founded fast-fashion retailer as a plausible valuation. It’s probably time to ask: are you sure about that number? The figure isn’t plucked out of thin air, it should be said. Shein raised money from private equity backers last year at a valuation of $66bn, which is roughly £50bn. But, since the company also raised a few dollars at a $100bn valuation the previous year, it has merely demonstrated the standard truth that valuations set in thin private markets can be volatile and are not to be relied upon. Translating a sketchy private number into a hard valuation on a serious public market is a different game. Then consider what has happened since those fundraisings. For starters, Shein has failed to get itself listed in the US, seemingly because of opposition from US lawmakers. London is now the likely destination – initial papers have been filed with the Financial Conduct Authority – but the label of being a New York reject, you would think, would knock a few quid off the price. Now comes something potentially far more serious. The EU is drawing up plans to impose custom duties on cheap goods imported from China and seems to have Shein – plus the likes of fellow marketplaces Temu and AliExpress – in mind. The threshold for the levy in the EU is €150 (£127) and was probably set at that level because of the administrative hassle of chasing small sums. But, given the explosive growth in such sub-€150 parcels, there is a fair argument that the retail market is now being distorted and it has become worthwhile for the authorities to pursue duties on packets now deemed “de minimis”. Why should Chinese-based retailers, dispatching orders in small packets to get under the duty threshold, while also enjoying subsidised postage costs in China, enjoy such an advantage? The same argument is running in the UK, where the threshold is £135. Simon Roberts, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, this week called for loopholes to be closed for “some of the businesses that aren’t paying tax in the right way, so it’s a level playing field for everybody”. Absolutely right: the rules need a fundamental rethink. An open question is how far Shein’s business model would be damaged if custom duties had to be paid. Donald Tang, Shein’s executive chair, has argued in the past that the firm embraces reform in the name of “fair competition around the world” and has claimed tax breaks are “not foundational to our success.” Outside investors, one suspects, would want to see detailed evidence to support the latter claim. The core pitch to consumers is that the clothes are dirt-cheap; the customs duty advantage does not feel irrelevant. In the meantime, the guessing-game on valuation must proceed on the basis of little detailed information. The Singapore-domiciled Shein drones on about how it uses AI to predict demand, how it ships to 150 countries and how it keeps waste to a minimum, but it is less forthcoming about financial performance. The FT reported that it had seen a financing document showing $2bn (£1.6bn) in profits for 2023 and roughly $45bn (£35bn) in gross merchandise value, but audited numbers are what count in a listing document and for valuation purposes. Even before one considers the controversy around alleged labour malpractices, some scepticism is required around the £50bn valuation. Shein is big, but it has barely started to explain its business meaningfully.",

        "title": "Ex-Post Office chair expresses ‘sincere regret’ over Horizon scandal",
        "content": "The former chair of the Post Office has expressed “sincere regret” for the state-owned body’s failings in the Horizon IT scandal and said it was a mistake not to show a key report on the problem to its board. Tim Parker, who was chair of the Post Office between 2015 and 2022, told a judge-led public inquiry that he felt “deep sympathy” for the Post Office operatives affected by what MPs have described as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in UK history. The Post Office wrongly prosecuted hundreds of operators because of financial shortfalls recorded in their branches but it has since emerged that the Horizon IT computer system was unreliable and suffered bugs, errors and defects. Parker told the inquiry that there were “failures at all levels” of the Post Office over the way it defended the high court lawsuit brought against it by Sir Alan Bates and 554 other Post Office operatives, and it “may have relied too heavily on the advice of lawyers in the way the case was conducted”. Bates’ group gained a significant victory in 2019 when a judge ruled in its favour, finding issues with the IT system. Parker – a former private equity veteran whom unions once dubbed “the Prince of Darkness” because of his cost-cutting tactics – said that when he took over as chair the business was in “deep crisis”. He said it “absorbed billions of pounds of taxpayer money and was still losing money”. After he took over, he commissioned a report from barrister Jonathan Swift looking at the Post Office’s handling of complaints made by operatives about the Horizon system after government ministers raised concerns. Parker told the inquiry that, after Swift completed his report in January 2016, it was not given to the Post Office board because he had been told by Jane MacLeod, then the Post Office’s general counsel, that the Swift report was confidential and covered by legal privilege. “I felt erroneously that legal privilege meant that the report effectively was circumscribed,” he said. Ministers were also briefed on the report but were not given a hard copy amid fears the document could become publicly disclosable through freedom of information requests, the inquiry heard. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy later wrote to Parker in October 2020 telling him it had been a “mistake” not to have shown the Swift report to the board. “At the time I was advised and I took that advice,” Parker told the inquiry, adding that, in 2016, he believed he was prevented from sharing the report with other board members. He accepted that if the Swift report had been discussed at board level it could have led to a “different approach” by the Post Office to the high court lawsuit. “Could we have shared it? I wish we had in a way,” he said. “What possible motive would I have at the time from hiding this report from my fellow board members other than receiving advice that I shouldn’t share it?… I had no vested interest in trying to protect the Post Office. It was simply the advice I received and I followed it.” He added: “I would accept with hindsight [this] was a misjudgment. I am not a lawyer and I received very strong legal advice which I took … I did that in good faith. I had no reason to deliberately hide this thing or chuck it into the long grass.” He said the board had been briefed by former chief executive Paula Vennells about recommendations from the Swift report and the government “certainly knew of the report”. Parker is a high-profile figure in the business world and is the former chief executive of shoemaker Clarks, Kwik-Fit, the AA and luggage firm Samsonite, and a former chair of National Trust. The inquiry heard that, when Parker took over as chair in 2015, he was working a minimum of 1.5 days a week but by November 2017 he had asked for that to be reduced to two days a month. Parker told the hearing he would “certainly rebut” any suggestion that he had not spent enough time at the Post Office. “I would say I was an active, energetic chair who took a lot of time and spent time with people to understand the business,” he said. The inquiry continues.",

        "title": "US service sector shrinks for first time since May 2020; UK private sector growth slows in ‘pre-election seize up’ – as it happened",
        "content": "The latest services survey from the Institute for Supply Management points to the first contraction in the services sector since May 2020, with the PMI headline index falling to 48.8 from May’s 53.8. The 50 mark separates growth from contraction. The business activity index plunged to 49.6 from 61.2, a massive drop. Over here, growth in the UK service sector slowed last month amid a “seize-up” in activity as companies put projects on hold in the run-up to the general election. The latest snapshot from the data provider S&amp;P Global showed growth in the UK’s dominant service sector – which includes transport, IT, finance, communications, property and business services – slowed in June to the lowest level in seven months. The survey of about 650 businesses, which is closely monitored by the Bank of England, showed a continued expansion in business activity at the end of the second quarter, stretching an unbroken growth run to eight months. However, businesses said some clients were opting to wait and see the results of Thursday’s vote before placing orders and commissioning new projects. In the eurozone, private sector growth eased to a three-month low, with activity in the service industries also at a three-month low. Global stock markets have been cheered by US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s remarks yesterday about the US “getting back on a disinflationary path” and optimism about interest rate cuts. Tonight, the minutes of the last Fed meeting could give further clues on the central bank’s thinking. Following strong gains in Asia, the French, Italian and German stock markets all rose by around 1%, led by France with a 1.2% gain. The UK’s FTSE 100 was 0.6% ahead. There is growing confidence that a majority for Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally can be avoided in the second election round on Sunday, with political wrangling under way. Our other main stories today: Olivia Cross, North America economist at Capital Economics, has looked at the sharp decline in US services, and what it means for the wider economy. The decline in the ISM services index to 48.8 in June, from 53.8, takes it to its lowest since the lockdowns in 2020. Alongside a decline in the ISM manufacturing index, these surveys suggest that GDP growth will remain weak in the third quarter. They also add to evidence that labour demand is softening, and inflation will remain on a downward trend. UK fruit and vegetable production has plummeted as farms have been hit by extreme weather. The country suffered the wettest 18 months since records began across the 2023-24 growing year, leaving soil waterlogged and some farms totally underwater. The impact on harvests has been disastrous. Data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs shows that year-on-year vegetable yields decreased by 4.9% to 2.2m tonnes in 2023, and the production volumes of fruit decreased by 12% to 585,000 tonnes. Scientists say that climate breakdown caused by the burning of fossil fuels is likely to bring more extreme weather to the UK, including more frequent floods and droughts. Farmers said they were not able to plant due to the wet weather, and this is borne out in the statistics. The growing area of vegetables was down, falling by 6.5% to 101,000 hectares. A dry early summer in 2023 also did not help, as those who could not irrigate found it hard to plant. The EU is moving forward with plans to impose customs duty on cheap goods in a shift that could hit imports from online retailers and harm a hoped-for London listing by the fast-fashion seller Shein. The potential change comes amid growing disquiet among retailers based in mainland Europe, the UK and the US about rising competition from Chinese-linked marketplaces Shein and Temu, which exploit a loophole that excludes low-value items from import duty. In the EU, the threshold for the levy is €150 (£127) and in the UK it is £135, enabling retailers such as Shein to ship products directly from overseas to shoppers in those markets without paying any import duty. In the UK, items valued at £39 or less also do not attract import VAT. Subsidised postage costs in China make it more cost-effective for businesses based there to send cheap goods by air. There is a big decline in the latest services survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which is closely watched by markets. It points to the first contraction in the services sector since May 2020, with the PMI headline index falling to 48.8 from May’s 53.8. The 50 mark separates growth from contraction. The business activity index plunged to 49.6 from 61.2, a massive move. June data signalled near broad-based growth in output across the seven monitored sectors, with technology the only area to register a fall in activity, according to a separate survey from S&amp;P Global. Leading the growth rankings for a second month running was the financials sector, where the rate of expansion in output picked up again to the sharpest since the end of 2021. Although returning to contraction territory for the second time in the last three months, technology firms recorded only a fractional drop in output in June. It was, nonetheless, the worst performing of the seven sectors. In contrast, the healthcare sector returned to growth in June, as output rose for the first time since March. Moreover, the rate of expansion in business activity was solid and the sharpest so far this year. The consumer goods and consumer services sectors saw differing trends during June, as growth in the latter accelerated to the fastest for two years. Meanwhile, consumer goods firms recorded the slowest upturn in output over the past six months. The basic materials sector saw an acceleration in the pace of output growth during June. Production levels rose at a solid rate that was the second-quickest since April 2022 (behind that seen in March 2024). The US service sector picked up momentum in June, with the biggest rise in new orders in a year. Companies responded by taking on more staff for the first time in three months, but even so backlogs of work built up. Price pressures from both input costs and output prices eased in June, but remained above pre-pandemic averages, mainly because of higher labour costs. The seasonally adjusted S&amp;P Global US services PMI business activity index increased for the second month running in June, to 55.3 from 54.8 in May. Activity in the sector has now risen in each of the past 17 months, with the latest expansion the most pronounced since April 2022. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: US service sector companies reported an encouragingly solid end to the second quarter, with output rising at the fastest rate for over two years. Both new order inflows and hiring have also accelerated, the latter buoyed by firms taking on more workers in response to rising backlogs of work. With additional – albeit more muted – support coming from the manufacturing sector, the survey data point to GDP rising at an annualised 2.0% rate in the second quarter, with a 2.5% rate seen for June. Forward momentum is therefore gathering pace. There is some nervousness creeping in regarding the post-election business environment, but for now at least confidence about the outlook for the coming year remains elevated by recent standards and supportive of businesses investing in expansion. Some of this optimism relates to ongoing convictions that interest rates will start to fall before the end of the year. In this respect, a further cooling of price pressures in the survey – notably in the services sector – adds to signs that inflation should trend lower in the coming months to open the door further for rate cuts. An investment trust run by Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford has sold its £20m stake in Rio Tinto, accusing the mining giant of not doing enough to tackle environmental and social concerns. Disclosure of the disposal by the FTSE 250-listed Monks Investment Trust, first reported by the Times, comes weeks after Baillie Gifford came under pressure from environmental activists in a row that led to it pulling out of sponsoring the Hay Edinburgh and other book festivals. Baillie Gifford pulled out after calls by campaign group Fossil Free Books (FFB) for the company to divest from fossil fuels and companies linked to Israel. Nine festivals that were previously sponsored by Baillie Gifford are now seeking donations, we reported earlier this week. Monks said on Tuesday that it would sell shares in companies that are not making enough progress on environmental, social and governance factors and named the mining group as a company it had ditched. Karl Sternberg, chair of Monks, said “concerns regarding governance and the approach to environmental impact” had not been “adequately addressed” by the world’s second-largest mining group. Monks first voiced concerns over Rio Tinto after it bulldozed a 46,000-year-old sacred Aboriginal site in Western Australia in 2020. The scandal triggered the departure of both Rio Tinto’s chief executive and chair. US trade data and labour market figures are out. The trade deficit widened slightly to $75.1bn in May from $74.5bn, as exports fell by 0.7% month on month, countering a 0.3% decline in imports. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said: Nevertheless, the decline in exports was more modest than the advance goods data had implied, so net external demand should now be a slightly smaller (albeit still sizeable) drag on second-quarter GDP growth. Factoring in the disappointing May construction spending data released yesterday too, we now estimate that GDP growth was 1.9% annualised – a little stronger than the first quarter, but well below the economy’s immigration-boosted potential growth rate. The $3.1bn decline in goods exports was driven by a $2.1bn drop in industrial supplies, which was partly linked to the fall in energy prices. The $1.9bn decline in goods imports was more than explained by a $4.2bn fall in pharmaceutical drugs, which tend to be quite volatile on a month-to-month basis. For the second quarter as a whole, we estimate that exports declined by 0.8% annualised, with imports up by 8.3%. The latest labour market data still look a little softer ahead of key June payrolls figures, due on Friday. ADP employment increased by a muted 150,000, and initial jobless claims edged up to 238,000, from 236,000. Alongside the news that GDP growth remained lacklustre in the first half of this year, this new-found labour market softness is a little disconcerting. Oil prices have climbed to a two-month high, ahead of the summer driving season, and amid renewed tensions in the Middle East. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose as high as $86.83 a barrel today, and is now trading at $86.41 a barrel, up 0.2% on the day. It has gained nearly $10 a barrel since the start of June. US light crude touched $83.36 a barrel and is now 0.2% higher at $82.97 a barrel, after pushing through $84 yesterday for the first time since April. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Oil prices are ticking upwards again, following a drop in US crude stockpiles for the week ending 28 June. Demand for fuel to power trips over the US holiday season is expected to be high. But traders are also eyeing potential supply constraints. Geo-political escalation in the Middle East is still a threat, given the ongoing violence in Gaza. The hurricane season forecast to be particularly fierce this year, given the devastation wreaked on the Caribbean this week and if severe storms hit the Gulf Coast, refining capacity could be significantly disrupted. Also on the health front, Syncona’s portfolio company Beacon Therapeutics has today raised $170m (£134m) to develop gene therapies that save and restore the vision of patients with blinding retinal diseases. Syncona, a London-based life science investor that is listed on the FTSE 250, committed £33.5m to the Series B financing, resulting in a £14.1m uplift in its valuation of Beacon. (Series B financing is the second round of funding for a business through investment.) Syncona launched Beacon last year, after taking advantage of challenging biotech market conditions to acquire Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation off Nasdaq in 2022, and combining it with other pre-clinical programmes, including from the University of Oxford. Beacon, headquartered in London with another base in Massachusetts, focuses on developing gene therapies for both rare and prevalent diseases of the eye that lead to blindness, including X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD). Beacon’s lead asset in XLRP is currently in intermediate to late-stage clinical trials. The approval of Eli Lilly’s Kisunla drug by the US health regulator means competition is heating up in the Alzheimer’s drug market, analysts say. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday approved the experimental Alzheimer’s drug donanemab, marketed as Kisunla, for the treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody slowed the early stages of the fatal mind-robbing disease in studies. It is the second disease-modifying therapy to reach the AD market in the US, after Eisai/Biogen’s Leqembi (Lecanemab) received full FDA approval last July. Philippa Salter, managing neurology analyst at the data and analytics firm GlobalData, forecast that Leqembi and Kisunla could generate global (US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Japan and China) sales of around $3.5bn and $2bn by 2030, respectively. She said: Despite gaining approval nearly a year ago, uptake of Leqembi has been slow. While the approval of Kisunla will provide further confidence [in this type of treatments], which could help drive the uptake of both drugs, many of the challenges faced by Leqembi will also apply to Kisunla. Both drugs require brain scans before treatment, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to assess levels of amyloid in the brain, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, with further MRI scans recommended prior to further drug infusions. She said access to these scans is a “key limiting factor for the uptake of these drugs”. Salter explained: The MRIs help monitor for a known side effect of these drugs, the development of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs). The rates of ARIA were lower in Leqembi’s Phase III trials compared to Kisunla’s Phase III trials, giving Leqembi a key advantage in its safety profile. However, an important competitive advantage for Kisunla is its once-monthly dosing schedule compared with Leqembi’s dosing of once every two weeks. Further, despite having a higher annual cost of therapy of $32,000 for Kisunla compared with $26,500 per year for Leqembi, Lilly states that in the long term, Kisunla will be cheaper and more convenient for patients since they won’t have to take the drug indefinitely, something that was included in the FDA label, which states that once amyloid plaques have been reduced to minimal levels on PET imaging, stopping treatment can be considered. While there are clear advantages in not having to take a drug indefinitely, many questions have been raised about what happens once donanemab therapy is stopped. Further real-world evidence and clinical trial data will be key for physicians to feel confident in stopping treatment with Kisunla and therefore vital for the success of the drug. Vodafone UK and Virgin Media O2 have announced they will extend and enhance their existing mobile network sharing agreement for the next decade. Vodafone is seeking to acquire Three UK in a deal which is currently being probed by competition regulators, but many aspects of the new network sharing agreement are independent of the outcome of the Vodafone UK and Three UK merger. The agreement will see a combined Vodafone UK and Three UK commit to invest £11bn in its network for the next decade – although this will be subject to regulatory approval of the deal – as well as Virgin Media’s £2bn annual investment in its network. The two operators have agreed subject to completion of the merger, Virgin Media O2 will acquire spectrum from the newly enlarged Vodafone and Three UK group establishing three scaled mobile network operators each with better alignment of spectrum holding. Ahmed Essam, chief executive of European markets at Vodafone, said: With this agreement and our merger with Three, we will transform the mobile experience for over 50m customers in the UK for the long-term, providing significant network improvements including more choice, better quality and greater coverage across the country. Lutz Schüler, chief executive of Virgin Media O2, said: We are extending and bolstering elements of our existing network sharing arrangement,while also ensuring there is a robust, balanced and functional structure in place for the long-term should Vodafone and Three’s proposed merger gain consent. Shares in Topps Tiles have fallen as much as 6% to the bottom of the FTSE Small Cap index after the British tile retailer said tough market conditions had lasted into the second half of its year. The shares fell as low as 38p and later traded at 39.4p, down 4.2%. Total sales were 6.9% lower year on year in its third quarter, while the UK tile market is down between 10% and 15%, and the company said it was taking market share. Demand for repair, maintenance and improvement has remained weak, especially for bigger projects. Like-for-like sales were 9.7% lower in the third quarter, similar to the 9.2% decline seen in the first half, although sales levels stabilised somewhat through the quarter. Topps said that slowing inflation, a pick-up in real wage growth, improving consumer confidence and increased activity in the housing market “provides some confidence in a cyclical recovery”. But it cautioned that this recovery is yet to feed through into its market, and it is working to improve its digital offer to trade customers and other measures. Following strong gains in Asian stock markets on optimism about US interest rate cuts, European equities are also pushing higher, led in part by France. There is growing confidence that a majority for Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally can be avoided in the second election round on Sunday, with political wrangling under way. France’s CAC has gained around 1%, while the UK’s FTSE 100 is 0.6% higher ahead of tomorrow’s general election, Germany’s Dax is also up by 0.6% and Italy’s FTSE MiB has risen by 1.3%. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at the trading platform Scope Markets, said: With President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist group and a left-wing alliance withdrawing candidates to minimise the number of three-way contests that might split the anti far-right vote, we have seen French [bond] yields head lower and stocks on the rise. With a hung parliament providing the basis for Macron to continue calling the shots, the market perception of a Le Pen victory comes down to the ability to achieve a majority or not. Tomorrow’s UK election looks unlikely to create too many shockwaves given the sheer size of the majority expected for the Labour party. While Reform have been busy chipping away at the Conservative vote, recent scandals will have likely stifled support with two candidates defecting due to perceived racism within the party. For traders, the prospect of a stable Labour majority appears to be a positive, with sterling one of the best performing currencies over the past week. Looking ahead, the US jobs market remains in focus. Yesterday’s JOLTS job openings data showed an unexpected rise counteracted by a downside revision to the May reading. Mahony said: With traders expecting a decline in Friday’s non-farm payrolls release, today’s ADP figure looks to similarly head lower in a sign of weakness in the employment picture. The weakness seen for the dollar yesterday came off the back of comments from Powell, with the data dependent nature of the Fed being seen as a positive given the weakness expected in the jobs data this week. Nonetheless, traders will be concerned over the inflationary impact of the recent rise in crude oil, with yesterday’s rise pushing WTI [West Texas Intermediate] through $84 for the first time since April. Expansion in the UK services sector slowed further in June with some evidence of a “pre-election seize up” feeding into a wider slowdown across the private sector to a six-month low, according to surveys. More momentum was lost in June, with the upturn at its weakest since last November as tomorrow’s general election prompted some clients to adopt a “wait-and-see” approach before placing orders and commissioning new projects. New business intakes rose at a historically subdued pace, while the pace of job creation also eased. Meanwhile, firms’ cost pressures continued to cool, but remained elevated. The rate of output price inflation accelerated slightly from May’s recent low. The seasonally adjusted S&amp;P Global UK services PMI business activity index remained in expansionary territory during June, posting 52.1. While this was the eighth consecutive monthly increase in output across the service sector, the headline index fell again, from 52.9 in May. Activity across the UK’s private sector slowed to a six-month low. The composite output index, which pulls together the manufacturing and services surveys, remained in expansion territory at the end of the second quarter, but the pace of growth in business activity slowed for a second month running to its weakest in 2024 so far. At 52.3, down from 53.0 in May, the index was at a six-month low. Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: We are seeing some evidence of a pre-general election seize up across the UK services economy, with growth in business activity slowing to a seven-month low in June as the prospect of a change in government led to the adoption of a “wait-and-see” approach by some, restraining sales. Nevertheless, we’re on track for another quarter of GDP growth, according to composite PMI data for the three months to June, albeit one that will be less punchy than the first quarter’s 0.7%. Turning to prices and firms’ costs, he said: Prices still continue to show a high degree of stickiness across the UK service sector, although input cost inflation once again trended lower in June. The direction of travel here is encouraging for the Bank of England, but our survey’s gauge of prices charged actually rose on the month as some companies noted their pricing power was strong enough to raise their fees. While costs, mostly from wages, have been the major driving force behind strong services inflation, the recovery of the UK economy from it’s late-2023 lull adds another dynamic for policymakers to consider should stronger economic conditions motivate more companies to raise their prices. Keywords Studios, an Irish video game services company that has worked on Fortnite and Call of Duty, has accepted a bid from the Swedish private equity firm EQT that values the business a £2.1bn. Investors will receive £24.50 a share in cash, the companies said in a statement today. This is below a May offer of £25.50 a share, but Keywords’ board unanimously recommended the bid, which EQT described as its final offer. The London-listed shares rose 2.8% to £23.82 today. Keywords was founded in Dublin in 1998 by Giorgio Guastalla and Teresa Luppino and listed on the London Stock Exchange’s junior AIM market in 2013. It provides game development, audio and art services to clients including the US video game makers Epic Games and Activision Blizzard. The company has expanded rapidly since going public by snapping up a string of support studios, and titles it has worked on include Fortnite, Call of Duty, Baldur’s Gate 3, Diablo IV, Starfield and Hogwarts Legacy. It operates across 26 countries. EQT returned with a lower bid, after Keywords said that a number of games and development projects had been delayed or cancelled, with the industry struggling to recover from last year’s Hollywood strikes. The company said it expects growth to pick up in the second half of the year. EQT was founded in Sweden more than 30 years ago with investment from the Wallenberg family, industrialists who are part-owners of international companies with Swedish roots, including AstraZeneca, ABB and Ericsson. In the eurozone, private sector growth eased to a three-month low, with activity in the service industries also at a three-month low, according to a closely-watched survey. Demand for euro area goods and services declined for the first time since February. The seasonally adjusted HCOB eurozone composite PMI output index, which pulls together the manufacturing and services readings, fell for the first time since October last year. At 50.9 in June, the headline index posted above the 50 no-change mark for a fourth month in a row, signalling a sustained increase in euro area business activity. However, it was down from 52.2 in May, and signalled a rise in output that was the softest in three months. Almost all of the eurozone nations with composite PMI data available recorded growth during June, but at a weaker rate than previously. Spain was again the fastest-growing euro area economy, with output rising sharply. Moderate upturns were recorded in Germany and Ireland, while Italian growth eased to a four-month low. France was the outlier, as private sector business activity weakened for a second month running. France’s service sector was the odd one out, where the sharpest fall in new orders since January weighed on output. Some firms linked the softening to the uncertainty surrounding the election called by president Emmanuel Macron, with the second round on 7 July. Business confidence also weakened, as did jobs growth. Output prices - those charged by firms – rose slightly and at the slowest rate in more than three years. The HCOB France services PMI business activity index posted below the 50 no change mark for the second month running. However, there was an improvement, with the index rising from 49.3 to 49.6. In Italy, the service sector also expanded but slightly lost momentum in June. Service providers had the highest confidence in their outlook since early 2022. Overall new business picked up again, but at the softest pace for five months. The headline index from the report, the HCOB Italy services PMI business activity Index fell to 53.7 in June, but remained above the 50 no change mark. That compared to 54.2 in May, and marked a sixth consecutive month that an increase in business activity has been recorded. Germany also lost some momentum, with its services business activity index easing to 53.1 in June from 54.2 in May, marking a three-month low. The upturns in new business and employment also slowed, while firms’ growth expectations for the coming year were at a five-month low. The final readings for the closely watched PMI surveys are out. In Spain, the private sector continued to expand at an above average pace in June, and firms hired more staff. Confidence in the future remained positive as firms looked to more stable economic and political environments in the months ahead. The headline index from the HCOB Spain services PMI business activity index was at 56.8 in June versus May’s 13-month peak of 56.9. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion. Thursday’s general election looks likely to be a historic pivot: one of those long-remembered moments when the established order at Westminster is swept away by what Jim Callaghan, the victim of one such shift in 1979, called a “sea change in politics”. Yet as Guardian reporters fanned out across the UK during the campaign to spend time talking to voters and non-voters in 15 varied constituencies for the Path to power series, they found precious little hope that things will be different come 5 July. Every constituency had its own particular concerns that bubbled up repeatedly in conversation: in Waveney Valley it was unwanted pylons, in Burnley it was the Gaza conflict and in Clacton it was immigration. But several common threads run through much of the reporting, forming a dark narrative about the state of Britain and its people as Labour prepares to take power. Everywhere reporters went, the infrastructure that makes up everyday life, from GP surgeries to libraries to roads, has been eroded by more than a decade of underinvestment. In Chingford and Woodford Green, in north-east London, the parlous state of the pavements came up; people in North Cornwall are crying out for a bypass. The NHS is raised again and again, in a litany of terrible stories, leavened with British stoicism. “I’m not knocking the NHS but it’s frustrating,” was how 26-year-old Katie Hayton, in Whitby, described her situation while awaiting a cornea transplant, for which she will have to travel 50 miles to York. At the same time, City investors said a landslide victory for Keir Starmer in the general election tomorrow could hand Britain a stability premium in global markets, boosting the pound, shares and investment in the UK at a time of mounting political turmoil elsewhere. In sharp contrast with Conservative party warnings over the dangers of a large Labour majority, analysts in the City of London said the prospect of a resounding mandate for Starmer’s party could secure Britain’s “safe haven” status among investors in an increasingly volatile world. After failing to close the gap in opinion polls during the election campaign, Rishi Sunak made a last-ditch warning that a Starmer “supermajority” would “bankrupt people in every generation”. However, City analysts said a Labour landslide could pave the way for global investment in Britain after years of political and economic uncertainty since the 2016 Brexit referendum under the Tories, which had clouded the prospects for international investors. Highlighting mounting political instability on both sides of the Atlantic and the meltdown in financial markets triggered by Liz Truss’s mini-budget – when investors spoke of a “moron premium” for Britain – City experts said a clear outcome on Thursday could return Britain to a steadier footing. Nuwan Goonetilleke, the head of shareholder assets at Phoenix Group, which manages more than £280bn in investments, said money was already pouring into London-listed assets in anticipation of a Labour victory. The UK is really being seen not just as a safe haven, but the safest of havens – especially in Europe. Several rich individuals in the UK are reportedly selling shares, property and other assets days before an expected landslide for the Labour party, which they fear would raise capital gains tax. Financial planners representing wealthy people told the Financial Times that some clients, from corporate chief executives to entrepreneurs, were offloading investments. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has said her party has no plans to raise CGT, but she has refused to rule out increasing the levy during a Labour government’s full term. Several wealth managers said “lots of clients” had been in contact with questions about a possible CGT increase. For higher or additional-rate taxpayers, the tax is levied at 20% on gains made from selling assets, while property is taxed at up to 24%. GSK has bought the full rights to develop, make and sell mRNA vaccines for flu and Covid-19 from Germany’s CureVac. The UK’s second-biggest drugmaker is paying €400m upfront and up to an additional €1.05bn to the biotech firm, which was founded in Tübingen in southwest Germany in 2000. The two companies have restructured their existing collaboration into a new licensing agreement. Since 2020, GSK and CureVac have worked together to develop mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases. They currently have vaccine candidates for seasonal influenza and Covid-19 in intermediate clinical trials (phase II) and avian influenza in phase I clinical development. The jabs are based on CureVac’s mRNA technology. Tony Wood, GSK’s chief scientific officer, said: We are excited about our flu/Covid-19 programmes and the opportunity to develop best-in-class mRNA vaccines to change the standard of care. With this new agreement, we will apply GSK’s capabilities, partnerships and intellectual property to CureVac’s technology, to deliver these promising vaccines at pace. Alexander Zehnder, CureVac’s chief executive, said: The collaboration with GSK has been instrumental in developing promising, late clinical-stage vaccine candidates, leveraging our proprietary mRNA platform. This new licensing agreement puts us in a strong financial position and enables us to focus on efforts in building a strong R&amp;D pipeline. The UK restaurant chain Hawksmoor has been put up for sale in a deal that could value the restaurant at about £100m. The popular chain of steak restaurants has hired investment bank Stephens to start looking for potential suitors for the business, which is currently looking to expand its overseas operation. Hawksmoor, which was founded in 2006 by Will Beckett and Huw Gott in London, has now expanded to 13 locations, including three outside of the UK. Last week it opened its first restaurant in Chicago, while also owning restaurants in Dublin and New York. Graphite Capital has owned a 51% stake in the chain since 2013 after it paid £35m to support a management buy out by both founders. The investment process, which was first reported by the Financial Times, will see Beckett, who is the current chief executive, and Gott, who owns a minority stake, retain their stake after a deal is concluded. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Yesterday’s comments from US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell have spread optimism over interest rate cuts across markets. Japan’s Nikkei, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and the Singapore and Taiwanese markets all rose more than 1%. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both closed at record highs. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum in Sintra, Portgual, Powell noted the latest inflation readings from April and May “do suggest that we are getting back on a disinflationary path.” However, he added: “We want to be more confident” before we decide on reducing policy. “We just want to understand that the levels that we’re seeing are a true reading on what is actually happening with underlying inflation.” Minutes from the Fed’s June meeting are due later today and could offer clues on the central bank’s thinking on rates. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank said: Federal Reserve (Fed) President Jerome Powell said that the Fed has made ‘quite a bit of progress’ on inflation and investors didn’t need more to jump back on the back of a bull. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record high again, while Nasdaq 100 hit the 20,000 mark for the first time in history. Shares in Tesla jumped 10.2% after the US electric carmaker reported a smaller-than-expected 5% drop in vehicle deliveries in the second quarter. It said price cuts and incentives helped stimulate demand.

        "title": "Figma’s AI app creator accused of ripping off Apple weather app",
        "content": "The technology design company Figma has pulled an AI-powered app creator, after accusations that the tool was ripping off Apple’s weather app. The chief executive of the company, which was the target of a $20bn takeover attempt by Adobe until EU and UK regulators opposed it, defended the tool against accusations of plagiarism on social media, but accepted that the company had “missed the mark” due to an issue “related to the underlying design systems”. Known as Make Designs, the AI tool launched by Figma allows users to enter a plain English description of an app they want to create, and watch as the user interface is generated out of thin air. But shortly after it launched, Andy Allen, the founder of the iOS app developer Not Boring Software, discovered that multiple requests to design a weather app repeatedly resulted in a program that was almost identical to the built-in iOS weather app that appears on Apple devices. “This is a ‘weather app’ using the new Make Designs feature and the results are basically Apple’s Weather app,” Allen said in a post on X this week. “Tried three times, same results.” On Tuesday, Figma’s chief executive, Dylan Field, posted a defence of the company’s feature. Despite appearances, Field said, the tool was not created by training an AI system on work done using the Figma app by other customers. “The Make Design feature is not trained on Figma content, community files or app designs,” he said, calling claims that the service was trained on existing apps “false”. Instead, the service used “off the shelf” large language models to instruct a more hand-coded “design system”, he said. Rather than designing the app from scratch, in other words, the AI system simply built an app using an algorithmic toolkit put together by Figma’s own designers. But that approach meant that “variability is too low”, Field accepted. “Within hours of seeing this tweet, we identified the issue, which was related to the underlying design systems that were created. Ultimately, it is my fault for not insisting on a better [quality assurance] process for this work and pushing our team hard to hit a deadline for [Figma’s annual conference] Config. “I hate missing the mark, especially on something that I believe is so fundamentally important to the future of design,” Field added. Adobe made a $20bn (£15.6bn) takeover bid for Figma in 2022 as its collaboration-focused suite of design tools began to represent a viable competitor to Adobe’s market-leading Creative Suite. But in 2023, the attempted merger was called off, with regulators in the EU and UK effectively blocking it for fear it would eliminate competition in the “product design software market”. “There is no clear path to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority,” the companies said in the joint statement in December. Adobe paid a $1bn termination fee to Figma after the collapse of the deal. Figma has been contacted for comment.",

        "title": "EU plan to impose import duty on cheap goods could dent Shein and Temu",
        "content": "The EU is moving forward with plans to impose customs duty on cheap goods in a shift that could hit imports from online retailers and harm a hoped-for London listing by the fast-fashion seller Shein. The potential change comes amid growing disquiet among retailers based in mainland Europe, the UK and the US about rising competition from the Chinese-linked marketplaces Shein and Temu, which exploit a loophole that excludes low-value items from import duty. In the EU, the threshold for the levy is €150 (£127) and in the UK it is £135, enabling retailers such as Shein to ship products directly from overseas to shoppers in those markets without paying any import duty. In the UK, items valued at £39 or less also do not attract import VAT. Subsidised postage costs in China make it more cost-effective for businesses based there to send cheap goods by air. A European Commission spokesperson said: “In May last year we put on the table customs reforms for a simple, smarter and safer customs union. What we have proposed now is there is no exemption any more for packages valued at below €150.” The e-commerce proposal must first be discussed and accepted by the European parliament, which sits again later this month. Last year, 2.3bn items below the duty-free €150 threshold were imported into the EU, according to a report in the Financial Times that highlighted the potential change. John Stevenson, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said that the impact of a change in the rules on Shein “would be huge depending on the territory”. Some countries imposed import duties of up to 30%, he said, and having to pay that would force Shein to either completely change its business model, put up prices or take a hit on profit. “The whole model is based on not paying duty,” he said. “It would have a massive impact.” Stevenson was quite sceptical that EU countries would be able to close the loophole in the short term, given the complexity and cost of checking billions of parcels. However, he said the issue would be high on investors’ list of concerns alongside potential ethical issues in its supply chain if Shein went ahead with launching a London listing, as is expected as early as this autumn. Shein also faces increased competition from fellow social media-driven retailers including TikTok Shop and Temu, as well as the post-Covid return to the high street by shoppers, which has helped the likes of Primark. Research from Earnest Analytics found that Shein shoppers in the US allocated 43% of their online discount spending to the brand last month compared with 66% a year ago, just before TikTok transactions began. Shein’s boss, Donald Tang, who is on a “fact-finding” mission in Europe, has said he is “pro reform” of the import duty threshold. He told Politico: “We want to have fair competition around the world” and said the tax break was “not foundational to our success”. Shein said in a statement that it was “fully compliant with UK tax policies and pays applicable taxes including corporation tax, VAT and employment taxes”. “Shein’s success comes from our ability to produce fashionable products for our customers. We keep prices affordable through our on-demand business model and flexible supply chain. “This reduces inefficiency, takes out wastage of material, and lowers our unsold inventory. We pass this advantage to our customers, and this has driven our growth.” UK retailers have called on the government to examine the loophole amid rising competition from Shein and Temu. On Tuesday, Simon Roberts, the boss of Sainsbury’s and Argos, called on a new government to look at unfair taxes including business rates and import duty. “I want to make sure that the loopholes that are currently in place are closed for some of the businesses that aren’t paying tax in the right way, so it’s a level playing field for everybody,” he said. Theo Paphitis, the owner of the UK retailers Ryman and Robert Dyas, and the Next boss, Simon Wolfson, have also called on the UK government to review the loophole.",

        "title": "UK service sector growth ‘seizes up’ as firms put plans on hold before election",
        "content": "Growth in the UK service sector slowed last month amid a “seize-up” in activity as companies put projects on hold in the run-up to the general election. The latest snapshot from the data provider S&amp;P Global showed growth in the UK’s dominant service sector – which includes transport, IT, finance, communications, property and business services – slowed in June to the lowest level in seven months. The survey of about 650 businesses, which is closely monitored by the Bank of England, showed a continued expansion in business activity at the end of the second quarter, stretching an unbroken growth run to eight months. However, businesses said some clients were opting to wait and see the results of Thursday’s vote before placing orders and commissioning new projects. Joe Hayes, a principal economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: “We are seeing some evidence of a pre-general election seize up across the UK services economy, with growth in business activity slowing to a seven-month low in June as the prospect of a change in government led to the adoption of a ‘wait-and-see’ approach by some, restraining sales.” Keir Starmer is widely expected to secure a landslide victory over Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives, with the final opinion polls before voters go the ballot box indicating a Labour majority well into triple digits over a shattered Tory party. City analysts have suggested a decisive Labour win could give Britain a stability premium in global markets, encouraging businesses to invest in the UK at a time of rising political unrest across other western economies. However, some financial planners have said their wealthy clients are selling assets and property in the fear that Labour could increase capital gains tax. The reading on the S&amp;P Global services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) slowed from 52.9 in May to 52.1 in June, its lowest reading since November but revised up from a preliminary estimate of 51.2. A reading of 50 separates growth in business activity from contraction. Hayes said the evidence from the PMI surveys suggested Britain’s economy was on track for another quarter of growth in the three months to the end of June, “albeit one that will be less punchy than the first quarter’s 0.7%”. Official figures showed that the UK economy exited recession in the first three months of the year, after a shallow downturn in the second half of 2023 as households cut their spending amid the cost of living crisis and higher Bank of England interest rates. Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the PMI would “likely bounce back” after the general election as businesses and households resume spending, with the wait-and-see approach expected to fade away.",

        "content": "The high-end steakhouse chain Hawksmoor has been put up for sale in a deal that could value it at about £100m. The restaurant chain has hired the investment bank Stephens to start looking for potential suitors for the business, which is hoping to expand its overseas operation. Hawksmoor, which was founded in 2006 by Will Beckett and Huw Gott, has expanded to 13 locations, including three outside the UK. Last week, it opened its first restaurant in Chicago, while also running sites in Dublin and New York. Graphite Capital has owned a 51% stake in the company since 2013 after it paid £35m to support a management buyout by both founders. The investment process, which was first reported by the Financial Times, will result in Beckett, who is the current chief executive, and Gott, who owns a minority stake, retaining their stake after a deal is concluded. Hawksmoor did not comment on the sale but Beckett said: “We’ve got a great relationship with Graphite, and together we are getting to know the US investment community in more depth. As that continues, an opportunity may emerge that we wish to explore together.” Beckett and Gott opened the first Hawksmoor restaurant in 2006 in Spitalfields, east London, before opening a second site in Covent Garden in 2010 and a third in the City of London in 2011. Last week, Hawksmoor recorded turnover across the business for the 12 months up to April, with revenues hitting £90m, up 20% from the year before. The FT reported that a person close to the company had said underlying profits at the company were above £10m at the end of June. The move comes three years after Hawksmoor shelved plans to float on the London Stock Exchange, citing broader uncertainty in the hospitality industry caused by supply chain disruption and labour shortages as the country exited pandemic lockdowns. The potential deal follows several high-profile sales of restaurant chains in the past 12 months. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie &amp; Benny’s and Wagamama, was taken private in October after accepting a £506m takeover offer from the US buyout group Apollo. In April last year, Fulham Shore, the owner of the Real Greek and Franca Manca, was bought by the Japanese restaurant operator Toridoll, in a deal worth £93m. The news of a possible sale for Hawksmoor comes amid a difficult outlook for the wider restaurant and pub industry. Last month, figures from the trade body UKHospitality revealed that between 2021 and 2023, 22,859 businesses in the sector closed, while only 11,734 opened. Graphite Capital said that it did not comment on market rumours.",

        "title": "Collapse of UK firm Small World means vital money transfers are not arriving",
        "content": "Thousands of people in developing countries have been left waiting for vital payments that many rely on to live after the Small World money transfer service collapsed. The company, part of LCC Trans-Sending, which allowed users to send cash for pickup collection in more than 170 countries, ceased trading on 10 June. Customers who paid money into the company’s account, expecting it to be sent on to friends and family, which failed to arrive, face an anxious wait to see how much of their payments will be returned. “Small World UK and its associated group businesses have ceased receiving or processing new money transfer transactions through its agents, branches, websites and mobile applications,” a statement on the company’s website said. While not a household name in the UK, Small World is understood to have been very popular in west Africa and the Philippines, often used by workers to send money back to families, or for people making charitable payments. Distressed customers have been taking to forums such as Trustpilot to report that they are still waiting for payments to be returned. On 18 June, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which regulated Small World’s parent firm, LCC Trans-Sending, said the company had entered special administration. Accountants at the appointed administrators, Grant Thornton, are now in the process of going through the books in an attempt to establish who is owed what. Judith Anderson, a Small World customer from Cardiff, is one of those caught up in its collapse. Anderson said she had used the service for the last 10 years without a problem but her most recent £400 payment, made at the weekend and destined for four families in the Gambia, has failed to arrive. “This is a big inconvenience for me but it is a disaster for the families that I send money to who rely on it to buy rice each month. There will be thousands of others around the world who will have been waiting for money they rely on who won’t have received it,” she said. The fact that she made her payment after the administrators were appointed means that she will probably get her full £400 back. The picture is less clear for those in the UK who sent money in the run up the firm’s collapse. Grant Thornton has told customers it is seeking to return amounts owed to UK customers “as soon as possible”. It said: “This will require securing all books and records and undertaking a review exercise of amounts owed to customers. Unfortunately, while this work is being undertaken customers will not be able to access the amounts owed to them. “Customers should note that when the special administrators are able to process amounts owed, such amounts will be reduced by costs associated with recovery and return to customers.” The FCA has said LCC had a number of agents who accepted money from customers on its behalf. LCC’s UK operation turned over £22.7m in 2022 and employed 60 staff.",

        "title": "‘We’re in limbo’: Boeing takeover leaves longtime Belfast factory under threat",
        "content": "Much has changed in Belfast since the 1930s. Yet through the second world war, decades of Troubles and the steep decline of heavy industry, the Short Brothers factory has continued to make planes and parts. Yet now a takeover by US planemaker Boeing of the factory’s owner, Spirit AeroSystems, has raised questions over its future. Workers and politicians fear a new ownership structure could lead to steep job cuts at one of Northern Ireland’s main manufacturers, which has about 3,500 employees. Boeing announced the $4.7bn takeover of Spirit on Monday, as it tries to regain control of parts of its supply chain after safety failures. However, Spirit is also a key supplier to its bitter rival Airbus as it makes wings and fuselage for the small A220 passenger jet. There was little prospect of Boeing supplying its European competitor, so Spirit will hand Airbus its factories in Belfast, France, Morocco and in Kansas and North Carolina in the US. Alan Perry, senior organiser at the GMB union, which represents workers at the plant, says about 40% of the factory’s revenue comes from making parts for Airbus. (The remainder is from companies such as Bombardier, Rolls-Royce and Honda Aircraft.) “The genuine fear is over the other 60%,” he says. “We’re very much still in limbo. Even if Airbus remains on site, we’re looking at the break-up of the factory.” Belfast’s industrial icons are in a tough place. The Short Brothers factory’s next-door neighbour, the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard, was forced to suspend its shares on Monday after failing to file audited accounts on time. The Airbus deal gives a strong sign that the Spirit assets it has taken over are not financially attractive: Spirit will pay Airbus $559m (£442m) to take the operations off its hands before the Boeing merger. Just four years ago, Spirit took over Bombardier’s operations in Northern Ireland, Morocco and Dallas in the US in a £211m deal. The Belfast operation, which still trades under the historical Short Brothers name, has not reported a profit since 2016. In the last decade of published financial results, it has reported cumulative losses of more than $1bn (£789m) – including $500m (£395m) in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the aircraft industry. It is a difficult situation for a company that is the world’s oldest aircraft manufacturer. The business traces its history to 1897, when Eustace Short started a company with his brother Oswald to make balloons. Manufacturing first started in Hove, then London, before they switched to aircraft construction after hearing of the Wright brothers’ successful demonstrations of their aircraft. The Shorts obtained the British rights to build copies of the Wright design, setting up the world’s first aeroplane factory on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, in 1909. The move to Belfast came in the 1930s, as the government realised that factories in south-east England would be vulnerable in the imminent war. Since then it has produced aircraft or parts constantly, under government ownership between 1943 and 1989, and then as part of Canada’s Bombardier until Spirit bought it in 2020. That long history – even through the Troubles that roiled the country for decades and stymied the development of the economy in the north of Ireland – has made it a key source of well-paid employment in a region that lags behind the rest of the UK. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS, a lobby group for the UK aerospace and defence industries, says consolidation “should not be to the detriment of our economic security of our sectors. “It remains the case that Northern Ireland plays a pivotal role in UK advanced manufacturing, delivering exceptional capabilities that are world-renowned for their quality,” he says. “It is vital that sites are maintained across these engineering centres of excellence and advanced manufacturing footprints.” The takeover could be an early test for Hilary Benn, currently Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary, if the party sweeps to power on Thursday as expected. It is understood that he has been briefed on the situation. Local politicians are concerned. Northern Irish economy minister Conor Murphy has said he wanted “to ensure that the future status of the highly skilled workforce is protected”, while Ulster Unionist party finance spokesperson Steve Aiken said the government must make sure work is not moved elsewhere. For the workforce, the takeover could mean weeks of uncertainty, with the potential for knock-on economic effects. “It is a major employer, not only within the local east Belfast area, but outside that as well,” says Perry. Job losses will have “consequences not only in the supply chain but in the wider economy”.",

        "title": "Labour landslide may boost investment and confidence in UK, say City analysts",
        "content": "A landslide victory for Keir Starmer in the general election on Thursday could hand Britain a stability premium in global markets, boosting the pound, shares and investment in the UK at a time of mounting political turmoil elsewhere, City investors have said. In sharp contrast with Conservative party warnings over the dangers of a large Labour majority, analysts in the City of London said the prospect of a resounding mandate for Starmer’s party could secure Britain’s “safe haven” status among investors in an increasingly volatile world. After failing to close the gap in opinion polls during the election campaign, Rishi Sunak made a last-ditch warning that a Starmer “supermajority” would “bankrupt people in every generation”. However, City analysts said a Labour landslide could pave the way for global investment in Britain after years of political and economic uncertainty since the 2016 Brexit referendum under the Tories, which had clouded the prospects for international investors. Highlighting mounting political instability on both sides of the Atlantic and the meltdown in financial markets triggered by Liz Truss’s mini-budget – when investors spoke of a “moron premium” for Britain – City experts said a clear outcome on Thursday could return Britain to a steadier footing. Nuwan Goonetilleke, the head of shareholder assets at Phoenix Group, which manages more than £280bn in investments, said money was already pouring into London-listed assets in anticipation of a Labour victory. “The UK is really being seen not just as a safe haven, but the safest of havens – especially in Europe,” he said. “Given the previous gyrations seen in the markets, whether that’s Liz Truss or the leftwing policies from Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour in 2019, we’re not really seeing any of those wild swings now. That tells you how far the UK has come from Brexit when there were huge unknowns priced-in for the UK. “With a Labour majority, it continues to really double down on that promise of economic stability, growth and wealth creation.” The pound has rallied against the euro on global currency markets since Emmanuel Macron called snap elections in France in early June, in a development opening the door to a possible far-right victory or hung parliament in one of the EU’s most powerful economies. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, said: “Given the political shockwaves being felt around Europe, the prospect of a stable political environment could yet help place the UK economy as a haven for years to come.” While UK government bond yields have remained stable in recent weeks, French borrowing costs have risen sharply. Investors said uncertainty over the outcome of the US presidential election in November had also bolstered UK assets. Any other result than a clear Labour victory would come as a shock in City dealing rooms after failure by Sunak to close a 20-point gap in opinion polls, which show the Conservatives on track for the party’s worst defeat since at least 1906. Starmer has also shifted Labour to the economic centre while courting big business, drawing criticism from the left that his agenda for government would differ little from that of the Tories and hand influence to wealthy interests. However, some party insiders believe ditching Corbyn-era policies is important for wooing swing voters and tackling accusations of fiscal incompetence that have clung to the party since the 2008 financial crisis. The Labour leader and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, also argue that restoring political stability after years of Tory infighting – leading the party to its fourth prime minister since 2016 – could reinvigorate private investment in Britain, helping to meet his growth ambitions without the need for large tax rises or additional government borrowing. While Sunak has argued “difficult decisions” taken under his premiership have helped the economy to “turn a corner,” which could enable interest rate cuts from the Bank of England, opinion polls suggest many voters are refusing to give him much credit after 14 years of Tory rule. Michael Browne, chief investment officer at the asset manager Martin Currie, said Britain’s economy and financial markets could benefit from a period of stability under a Labour government that was “more moderate and international in tone”. He said the situation was comparable to 1997 when UK government bonds and sterling rallied in anticipation of Tony Blair’s landslide victory. “To quote a well-known campaign slogan from 1997: ‘Things can only get better.’ With the current backdrop we would like to think so for the UK’s equity assets.”",

        "title": "Ford chief says Americans need to fall ‘back in love’ with smaller cars",
        "content": "It is time for the US to “get back in love” with smaller cars, according to the chief executive of Ford. In a wide-ranging interview at the Aspen Ideas festival, Jim Farley said the auto industry needs to focus on smaller EVs and commercial vehicles. He acknowledged that American consumers are in “love with these monster vehicles” but said they need to “get back in love” with small cars. “We have to start to get back in love with smaller vehicles. It’s super important for our society and for EV adoption,” Farley said. “We are just in love with these monster vehicles, and I love them, too, but it’s a major issue with weight.” The average weight of a new vehicle sold in the US last year was 4,329lbs (2,000kg) – an increase of 1,000lbs (450kg) from 1980. Ford expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, breaking a price barrier that has made the adoption of EVs an unobtainable luxury to all but the auto industry’s wealthiest customers. Farley told the festival last week that the company’s new EV vehicle would be a competitor of China’s BYD, which the Biden administration is looking to effectively ban from the US market by quadrupling import tariffs. It would also rival a new, entry-level electric car from the US maker Tesla, expected next year. Farley said Ford would focus on the new vehicle – not larger all-electric trucks and SUVs. Larger vehicles, using internal combustion engines, have traditionally driven US carmakers’ profits, especially at Ford. “You have to make a radical change as an [automaker] to get to a profitable EV. The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs,” Farley said during an interview with CNBC’s Julia Boorstin. “That’s the duty cycle that we’ve now found that really matches. These huge, enormous EVs are never going to make money: the battery is $50,000, even with low-nickel, LFP chemistry. They will never be affordable.” A Ford spokesperson clarified that he was referring to the company’s Super Duty models, which require massive battery packs to achieve ranges of 500 miles, and are said to be heavier than a Honda Civic. But he said the stakes are high for Ford and the other automakers over the next five years, as they seek to compete with Chinese EV makers. Farley said it was crucial for Ford, which lost $132,000 on every EV sold in the first three months of the year, to make profitable EVs in the next five years. “If we cannot make money on EVs, we have competitors who have the largest market in the world, who already dominate globally, already setting up their supply chain around the world,” Farley said. “And if we don’t make profitable EVs in the next five years, what is the future? We will just shrink into North America.” Last month, the Biden administration announced it would place a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs, which can retail for as little as $10,000 – far less than the average $53,000 in the US. The move was interpreted as a political gesture to protect US auto-industry jobs in critical election swing states of Pennsylvania and Michigan. “For too long, China’s government has used unfair, non-market practices,” the administration said, adding that the action against Chinese EVs was designed to ensure “the future of the auto industry will be made in America by American workers”. But the Atlantic Council warned that Biden’s electric vehicle tariff strategy is “not likely to change Chinese behavior” unless it is shared by G7 allies. “The United States can impose high electric vehicle tariffs because China only represents 1-2% of the US EV imports. By contrast, EVs from China already comprise over 20% of Europe’s EV imports, making tariffs more likely to raise costs for consumers,” the council said.",

        "title": "Dale Vince sues Guido Fawkes owner for libel over Hamas claims",
        "content": "The Labour donor Dale Vince has employed a new legal approach to sue the political blog Guido Fawkes for libel, despite the website being hosted overseas. Vince, who has given millions of pounds to Labour in the run-up to the general election, says the Westminster-focused blog falsely suggested that he supports Hamas, a proscribed terrorist group. The green energy entrepreneur is now personally suing the site’s Ireland-based owner Paul Staines. The editor has previously declared that his Irish nationality and his blog being hosted in the US meant that “I don’t have to pay attention to what a British judge orders me to do”. Vince said: “He believes his ‘offshore’ structure protects him from being accountable, that he can flout our laws and disregard basic principles … With this legal action we hope to change that.” The green energy businessman has been given permission by an English judge to serve libel papers on Staines via email and post to his home in Ireland. Staines declined to comment. Vince is also seeking a website blocking order, which means that a London-based court could order British internet service providers to block access to specific blogposts. The approach is more commonly used in copyright cases, such as the blocking of illegal Premier League football streams. The case hinges on a Guido Fawkes post from March entitled “Multi-million pound donor to Labour party says Hamas are ‘freedom fighters’”. It consists of an edited clip from a Times Radio interview where Vince is asked: “Is a terrorist attack from Hamas Palestine defending itself?” Vince replies: “I think one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter, right? That’s how it works.” The businessman claims the clip was used to imply that he supported the terrorist acts of Hamas, including “the mass murder, kidnapping and rape which took place on 7 October”. The Daily Mail and GB News have already apologised and paid damages to Vince over similar stories. Vince said in a statement: “Some weeks ago, the Guido Fawkes website published false claims about me which spread quickly amongst rightwing channels and commentators, probably in part due to the imminent election. The intention was clear, to damage my credibility as a person and as a Labour supporter. “We’ve secured numerous retractions with costs and damages already, such as from the Daily Mail and GB News, and for me this is the most important piece of the puzzle, the source. I’m pleased we’ve now been given permission to take action against the editor, Paul Staines.” The Guido Fawkes site has previously said it asked Vince “to put on the record unambiguously that he does not think Hamas are freedom fighters”, in which case they “will be happy to withdraw and/or amend our previous reports accordingly”. It added: “They stated he had previously condemned terrorism on the record. We accept and never claimed otherwise that Mr Vince has previously condemned terrorism, including saying of the specific acts of Hamas terrorism on the weekend of October 7, 2023: ‘I don’t support what they did.’ We remain baffled therefore why he won’t even through his lawyers confirm that he does not think Hamas are, in the words he used, ‘freedom fighters’.” Guido Fawkes has links to the Tory party, having recently appointed the Conservative peer Ross Kempsell as a contributing editor. A former head of Boris Johnson’s Downing Street policy unit, he was given a peerage in Johnson’s resignation honours list.",

        "title": "M&S increases stocks of smaller womenswear sizes due to higher demand",
        "content": "Marks &amp; Spencer is increasing its stocks of smaller sizes in womenswear after a surge in demand left gaps on shelves. Stuart Machin, the chief executive of the high street stalwart, said that three years ago about a fifth (21%) of the items sold from its main seasonal collection were size six to 10 and that had now risen to 35% as its “fashion and style ranges [were] resonating with a different customer group”. Even outside those more fashionable ranges, sales of smaller sizes now represent about 23% of the mix, a rise from about 20% three years ago. Answering a complaint from a shopper at the retailer’s annual general meeting – that there were not enough smaller sizes in stock – Machin said on Tuesday that he had personally looked at the orders on smaller sizes to ensure there were more and “if we sell out in autumn/winter we’ll be doing very well”. The demand for smaller sizes reflects the increasing popularity of M&amp;S, once mainly worn by those well over 50, with shoppers in their 20s, 30s and 40s who on average tend to be slimmer. A spokesperson for M&amp;S, which stocks women’s clothing from size six to 24, said: “We’re not moving away from larger sizes, it’s more about getting better at responding to demand and making sure we have the right size mix and availability for all of our customers – which is something we haven’t always got right.” In May, Machin said more under-30s were buying M&amp;S’s lingerie than ever before, helping take its market share in that product category to a new high of 38%. That broader appeal has help the revitalised retailer win more than 1 million extra shoppers and boost profits by 41% in the year to 30 March. The retailer has tried to improve its fashion credentials and reach a new generation of shoppers by using social media, including training its own staff as influencers. It has also enlisted younger names than it has traditionally used in advertising campaigns, such as Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Zawe Ashton. Tie-ups with celebrities such as Sienna Miller, the 42-year-old actor known for her style, have also been important. M&amp;S said 10 was the most popular size in Miller’s range and 32% of items in its spring and summer campaign were in size six to 10. On the M&amp;S website, six of the 19 clothing items available in Miller’s collection are sold out in sizes six to 10 Pippa Stephens, senior apparel analyst at GlobalData, said M&amp;S’s decision to start stocking outside brands such as Nobody’s Child and Sweaty Betty on its website had helped boost its appeal with younger shoppers while the design of its own-label gear now had “more fashionable shapes and prints”. But she said that it may also be that a larger number of older shoppers were now more trim and “more aware of exercise and healthy eating”. Machin has also rejigged M&amp;S’s food stores so that they have greater appeal to young families, with the Essential range of cheaper basics, larger packs and enough items to make it possible to do a full weekly shop. Dozens of investors attended M&amp;S’s annual meeting at the Paddington headquarters, albeit many fewer than the vast gatherings the FTSE-listed company was once known for when shoppers often berated it over the length of sleeves, knicker elastic and other matters. During the pandemic, M&amp;S switched to holding the meetings online, but said it was now committed to a hybrid set-up. At the meeting, the retailer had to defend its use of agency workers, such as cleaners, who are not guaranteed at least the real living wage unlike the main shop floor staff who are directly employed by M&amp;S. Machin and M&amp;S chair Archie Norman also defended a decision to cut back the lifetime staff discount. Employees who had worked for the retailer for at least a decade had previously received the 20% discount, but on 1 July M&amp;S lengthened the service period to 25 years. Machin said he had decided to make a change after discovering that 50,000 people who had left M&amp;S were able to claim the discount, which he said was hitting profits.",

        "title": "Shell to pause construction of huge biodiesel plant in Rotterdam",
        "content": "Shell has paused the construction of one of Europe’s largest biofuel plants which was expected to convert waste into green jet fuel and biodiesel by the end of the decade. The oil company said on Tuesday it would “temporarily pause” work on one of its biggest energy transition projects to address the technical difficulties that have delayed its progress so far. Shell began constructing the plant, based in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, in 2021, and had initially expected to start producing up to 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year in April, before this was pushed back to 2025. About half of the plant’s biofuels were to be used for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from waste cooking oil and animal fat. The fuel is seen by some as crucial if airlines are to cut their carbon emissions in line with global climate targets. The nascent industry has also attracted criticism from those who claim that SAF is not a realistic replacement for paraffin-based aviation fuels within the timescale needed to prevent rising carbon emissions from creating a climate catastrophe. “We’re taking the tough decision now to temporarily pause on-site construction,” a Shell spokesperson said. “This gives us the opportunity to take stock, complete engineering, optimise project sequencing and in doing so maintain capital discipline.” The spokesperson added: “Low-carbon fuels form a key part of Shell’s ambitions to provide affordable and sustainable products to our customers.” The aviation industry accounts for 3% of the world’s carbon emissions, and is seen as one of the most difficult forms of transportation to decarbonise. The decision to pause the work deals another blow to Shell’s biofuels plans after the company cancelled an SAF project at Singapore’s Bukom Island in March last year. Shell was considering investment in a plant that could produce 550,000 tonnes of SAF a year to supply major Asian hubs such as Hong Kong International airport and Singapore’s Changi. The blow to Shell’s green aviation plans has come after the company signalled a scaling back of its green growth ambitions by reducing the number of staff working on low-carbon solutions by at least 200 roles, while a further 130 positions will be placed under review. The decision is expected to affect Shell’s plans for offshore wind development and sharply scale back its ambitions to fuel hydrogen passenger vehicles. Shell was an early adopter of hydrogen, which has fallen out of favour as electric vehicles become more popular. Instead, Shell’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, is planning to shift its focus towards high-profit oil projects and expanding its gas business to exploit higher global oil and gas prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The rise in global energy market prices has prompted executives across the oil and gas industry to review green investment plans and climate targets. BP confirmed last week it would halt investment in new offshore wind projects, and place a hiring freeze for the new business division, in an apparent attempt to placate investors who are unhappy with the greener direction set by its ousted boss Bernard Looney.",

        "content": "Britain’s next government has been urged to set up a taskforce to explore the future for the state-owned Post Office including mutualisation – once victims of the Horizon IT scandal have been financially compensated. The Post Office Horizon IT scandal has been described by MPs as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in recent years and was highlighted by the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. The UK government faces the prospect of paying out multimillion-pound sums to compensate hundreds of post office operators who were wrongly prosecuted by the Post Office and lost money because the Horizon IT system wrongly showed financial shortfalls at their branches. A judge-led public inquiry is now trying to find out what went wrong. However, there are growing questions about the longer-term future of the government-owned Post Office with its 11,500 branches across the UK which reported a £76m loss for the year ended March 2023, down from £130m in the previous year. It has 5,200 post offices in rural areas that provide vital services such as banking to communities where banks have closed their branches. Nigel Railton, the Post Office chair, recently launched a strategic review looking at the sustainability of the business and its future. “As part of this work we’re seeking the views of serving postmasters and other stakeholders with an interest in Post Office’s role in communities across the country,” the Post Office said. Earlier this year, Voice of the Postmaster, which represents about 900 operators, the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents Post Office employees, and Co-operatives UK met Kevin Hollinrake, the then Post Office minister, to talk about mutualisation which would lead to the ownership transferring from the state to staff. Rose Marley, the chief executive of Co-operatives UK, the trade body for the UK’s 7,000 independent co-operative businesses, believes the next government should seriously explore the practicalities of mutual options for the Post Office – once victims have received financial compensation. She said: “We understand that the Post Office network is complex, but if postmasters had enjoyed a genuine stake and a say in how the Post Office operates, it’s pretty clear we wouldn’t be in this mess. “Evidence also shows that worker and employee-owned businesses are more productive, while community-based co-operatives are more resilient and sustainable as well, so it has to be looked at.” Richard Trinder, the chair of Voice of the Postmaster, said a proposed taskforce could look at the critical challenges faced by Post Office and expand the scope of mutualisation to include not only post office operators and the communities they serve, but also examine issues such as long-term financial liabilities, IT legacy and a revised business model. Trinder said: “There has to be a process for redressing victims of the scandal and we have to get the government to contribute and then leave the Post Office clear for a huge restructuring.” Andy Furey, the assistant secretary of the CWU, said: “We support the concept of mutualisation as we have in the past. However, before any mutualisation can start then we need a new operating model and all key stakeholders need to play a significant part in running the company. The current management cannot remain in place and there needs to be significant investment.” The National Federation of SubPostmasters (NFSP), which also represents Post Office operators, believes there should be an oversight committee which would work with the government: “While mutualisation is the ultimate goal of the NFSP, without the financial support of government, the Post Office simply would not survive and would result in thousands of postmasters losing their investment. “What is more important is the governance of the Post Office, which is significantly responsible for the failures around the Horizon scandal. This is why the NFSP is proposing an oversight committee to work with the government as the shareholder, PO as the operator and postmasters as investors in the network. As the PO has a social purpose, this oversight committee should include consumer champions.” In 2012, the then coalition government pledged to examine whether the Post Office could become a multi-stakeholder mutual that gave membership to post office operators and their customers, but no further action was taken. Labour’s election manifesto has pledged to “explore ways to strengthen the Post Office network”, in consultation with post office operators, trade unions and customers, and support the development of new business models, such as banking hubs, that will help reinvigorate the high street. The Liberal Democrats say they would encourage post offices to become community banking and government hubs. The Conservatives say in their manifesto that the Post Office should remain a “valuable social and economic asset” and delivering that goal “requires a change of culture at the top”. All the main parties have promised to ensure compensation for the victims of the scandal. Rose Marley, the boss of Co-operatives UK, said: “The compensation is an absolute No 1 priority and rightly so and I think whatever political party gets in power … doing right by those postmasters is something the public want to see.”",

        "title": "M&S gets it right (finally) on annual meetings. Others should make an effort | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "Archie Norman’s first attempt, a year ago, to reinvent the annual shareholder meeting for the digital age suffered from an enormous error. In designing the event as digital-only – in other words, in telling shareholders not to turn up in person and to tune in online instead – the chair of Marks &amp; Spencer abused the well-established principle that even small investors in a listed company must have the right, once a year, to buttonhole the bosses in the flesh. Directors cannot expect to live virtually; the pandemic is over. His second effort on Tuesday was vastly improved because it was a genuine hybrid event. Shareholders were free to ignore M&amp;S’s odd advice that they would get “the best experience” by joining online, and 100-plus individuals were in the room at the company’s headquarters in Paddington, west London. The point, let’s hope, has been made: leave it up to the punters to decide how they wish to participate, which is how M&amp;S behaves in its day job as an “omnichannel” retailer. Yet Norman’s push for greater digital access is correct at its core. To catch the attention of private shareholders – folk who everybody says are vital to the task of reviving interest in public markets – there must be a video component in the age of Zoom and Teams. Not everybody lives in London, where most meetings happen. M&amp;S’s online audience was many times greater than the one in the building. One cannot say the investors were treated to scintillating content, of course. The main mini-revelation in the Q&amp;A was that the company had an astonishing 50,000 ex-employees with discount cards entitling them to 20%-off for life before the chief executive, Stuart Machin, decided the policy was absurdly generous and moved the qualifying employment period from 10 years to 25. But shareholders did get to press Norman on his cautious approach to dividends, which seemed to be their main grumble. And he and Machin were obliged to explain why M&amp;S won’t guarantee to pay its contractors, as opposed to its staff, the real living wage. That is worth doing in a public forum. Broadly speaking, the hybrid format worked. It is possible to quibble with the use of a “shareholder advocate”, in the form of broadcaster Anita Anand, to select the online questions, but a managed process does allow more ground to be covered. And an outsider is arguably better placed than the chair to cut off verbose questioners or the offensive variety (recall the appalling misogynistic comments at Aviva’s meeting a couple of years ago). Other companies should take note. Attendances at annual company meetings have been in decline for years. Most boardrooms give the impression they wish the events didn’t exist, whether out of fear of protesters or because they regard small investors as irrelevant. Norman is at least trying to stir interest and “stand up for the small shareholder”, which should be applauded. A few big-name investment trusts, such as Fundsmith and Scottish Mortgage, attract healthy audiences of interested investors who ask sharp questions. There is no reason why regular companies shouldn’t aim for the same thing. It would show a certain basic acceptance of the advantage of openness. More shareholders should attend, whether virtually or in person. More companies should make it worth their while.",

        "title": "Sainsbury’s boss says rate cuts needed to spur consumer spending; eurozone inflation dips to 2.5% – as it happened",
        "content": "Our main stories today: Sainsbury’s has said sales growth slowed in recent weeks as food inflation eased and consumers shopped “more cautiously” amid poor weather and the cost of living crisis. Sales at established stores rose 3% in the three months to 22 June compared with a rise of 4.8% in the previous quarter, excluding fuel and the impact of the closure of the group’s Irish Argos stores. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said consumers’ caution was not surprising given everything households have been through in the cost of living crisis. Until we see sequential interest rate cuts, hopefully as soon as possible, that caution from consumers is going to continue on those more discretionary items. People want more certainty that the cost of owning a home is going to come down. Inflation across the eurozone slowed to 2.5% in June despite lingering pressure on households from price increases in the service sector, leaving the European Central Bank on track to keep interest rates on hold this month. Annual inflation in consumer prices across the 20-country bloc eased from 2.6% in May, according to a flash estimate from the EU statistical agency Eurostat, matching financial market expectations. Our other stories: Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Bye! – JK Q: What is the biggest risk facing the economy today? Both Powell and Lagarde point to cyber attacks. Lagarde also mentions the “backlash against the fight against climate change”. The debate has moved on to artificial intelligence. Lagarde said the ECB uses AI in models, and “whenever we need a lot of language mining in structured and unstructured data”. Tesla has reported a smaller-than-expected 5% drop in vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, sending its shares sharply higher. The US electric vehicle maker said price cuts and incentives helped stimulate demand. Shares of the world’s most valuable automaker jumped more than 8%, valuing the company at $712bn. The EV maker handed over 443,956 vehicles in the three months to June 30, 4.8% lower than a year earlier, and up 14.8% from the prior quarter. Powell is asked about the US debt levels. “The US is running a very large deficit” at a time of high employment, he observed. The level of debt is not unsustainable but the path we are on is unsustainable. It should be a real focus going forward… You cannot run this kind of deficits in good economic times. Asked about the French election, Lagarde declined to comment directly. Our mandate is price stability and that is obviously based on financial stability. She said the central bank is monitoring developments in markets, such as bond yields, as usual. We are very attentive. Powell reiterated that the risks to inflation are much more balanced than a year ago, when the Fed was mainly focused on bringing inflation down from high levels. Asked about rate cuts, he said: The risk on the inflation side is that we move too quickly and inflation comes back…And the other risk is that we wait too long and we lose economic momentum, such as the expansion in the labour market, he said. Powell is now asked about the inflationary effect of Taylor Swift touring Europe, and services inflation. He sidesteps the first bit, and says: Famously services inflation is stickier and famously it is tied to labour. You can see the labour market is cooling off. It’s doing what you would want it to do – it’s cooling off over time. We don’t see ourselves getting back to 2% inflation this year or next year, maybe late next year. US inflation is currently at 2.6%. “What is keeping prices sticky?” Lagarde is asked – in relation to the eurozone’s 4.1% rate of services inflation. It’s still likely to be a bumpy road until the end of 2024. She said the ECB is trying to determine the “root causes” – whether high services inflation is caused by permanent changes, or lagged effects of other components. What is behind is is a lot of wages. Services has a high component of labour. “We are getting back on an disinflationary path,” said Jerome Powell. “We want to be more confident” before we decide on reducing policy, he added. Because the US economy is strong and the labour market is strong, we have the ability to take our time. If we go too soon, we could undo the good work we’ve done in bringing down inflation. We have two-sided risks now. In her opening remarks, Lagarde said: We are very advanced on this disinflationary path. Asked if she was setting markets up for a pause in interest rate cuts, she said: I’m not setting up anything for anyone… It’s looking under the skin of the economy. In Sintra, Portugal, European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell are now speaking at a policy panel at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra in Portugal now. Also on the panel is Roberto de Oliveira Campos Neto, president of the central bank of Brazil. You can watch live here (via the ECB’s website). The ECB cut its main deposit rate last month to 3.75% from a record high of 4%, putting it ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have yet to reduce borrowing costs. It was the first time that the main eurozone interest rate had been reduced in almost five years. Lagarde said yesterday that benign economic developments suggest that further interest rate cuts are not urgent, with a robust labour market and resilient wage growth. The Biden administration has unveiled a long-awaited proposal to protect workers from extreme temperatures. If finalized, the rule will establish the nation’s first-ever federal safety standard for excessive heat exposure in the workplace and protect as many as 36 million indoor and outdoor workers. Announced on Tuesday amid temperature warnings across the country, the rule would require employers to establish heat safety coordinators, undergo extreme heat safety training, create and regularly update emergency heat response plans, and provide workers with shade and water. It would also require a heat acclimatization process for new employees to gradually increase their exposure to high temperatures. Three out of four workers who die of workplace heat exposure in the US die during their first week on the job, senior administration officials told reporters on Monday. Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corporation has launched its ad-supported streaming service, Tubi, in the UK. The platform will compete with services such as Netflix, Disney+, ITVX and Channel 4’s streaming platform as well as BBC iPlayer. Fox says the service will launch with more than 20,000 films and TV episodes on-demand, featuring content from Disney, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and Sony Pictures Entertainment, in addition to its own originals. The Twilight films, starring Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, the horror film Candyman and the Tubi original reality series House of Heat are among the current offerings. Nine festivals that were previously sponsored by investment company Baillie Gifford are now seeking donations. “Amidst intense discussion around arts funding and challenges to our continued flourishing”, reads a joint statement, the festivals have “joined forces” to “call for increased support”. Monday’s statement comes weeks after Baillie Gifford partnerships with the nine festivals ended – including Hay festival, Edinburgh international book festival and Cheltenham literature festival – after calls by campaign group Fossil Free Books (FFB) for the company to divest from fossil fuels and companies linked to Israel. “As writers and other book workers, we care deeply for literary festivals and support their call for sustainable funding,” said FFB in response to the statement. When Jensen Huang spoke at the Nvidia annual general meeting last week, he made no mention of a share price slide. The US chipmaker, buoyed up by its key role in the artificial intelligence boom, had briefly become the world’s most valuable company on 18 June but the crown slipped quickly. Nvidia shed about $550bn (£434bn) from the $3.4tn (£2.68tn) peak market value it had reached that week, as tech investors, combining profit-taking with doubts about the sustainability of its rocketing growth, applied the brakes. Huang, however, spoke like the CEO of a business that took 30 days this year to go from a valuation of $2tn to $3tn – and sees $4tn coming into view. He described a forthcoming group of powerful new chips, called Blackwell, as potentially “the most successful product in our history” and perhaps in the entire history of the computer. He added that the new wave for AI would be automating $50tn of heavy industry, and described what sounded like an endless loop of robotic factories orchestrating robots that “build products that are robotic”. Wrapping up, he said: We’ve reinvented Nvidia, the computer industry and very likely the world. These are the kinds of words on which a $4tn valuation, and the AI hype cycle, are built. Nvidia shares are inching back, returning above $3tn this week, because it remains the best way to buy shares in the AI boom. Is that enough to propel it to $4tn despite the emergence of investor doubt? The UK’s transition to net zero is under threat as delays in approving new infrastructure put billions of pounds of investment in offshore wind schemes and other vital upgrades at risk, big ports have said. The British Ports Association (BPA) has written to the government and Labour calling for action to clear the backlog of harbour orders, the legislation needed for ports to make infrastructure changes to support offshore wind projects. The shadow energy security secretary, Ed Miliband, this week promised Labour will take lead on global efforts to tackle the climate crisis if it wins Thursday’s election. Port authorities hope to take advantage of the growth of the offshore wind industry – seen as vital to hitting the UK’s legal commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – by upgrading their infrastructure to allow the assembly and maintenance of turbines on site. Analysts at JPMorgan looked at the outlook for the US debt and deficit last week: If markets begin to question the credibility of US sovereign debt, the dollar could depreciate, and inflation could accelerate. Although historical data suggests this risk is low in the medium term, it cannot be entirely ruled out. For instance, the United Kingdom faced a “mini” fiscal crisis in 2022, leading to a 10% depreciation of the pound. A similar scenario in the United States could erode the dollar’s purchasing power and increase import prices, contributing to inflation. However, this risk is mitigated by the credibility of U.S. monetary authorities and the dollar’s status as the primary global reserve currency. The likelihood of the United States defaulting on its debt remains extremely low (technical defaults due to the statutory debt limit are a different story). The United States benefits from issuing debt in its own currency, which is also the global reserve currency. This unique position allows for a higher debt-carrying capacity compared to countries such as Argentina and Turkey, which issue debt in foreign currencies. Additionally, the United States has a robust tax base and the ability to raise revenues through tax reforms if necessary. Japan, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 228%, provides a useful example of a country that has managed to avoid a fiscal crisis despite twice the indebtedness of the United States. They concluded: The most likely scenario for the next few years is the status quo: Deficits remain wide and debt levels continue to rise. Despite the associated risks, we believe these won’t destabilize multi-asset portfolios due to the credibility of policymakers, ongoing investor demand for US Treasury assets and a robust tax base. There are methods to address the debt problem. One option is preemptive fiscal reform, which could involve altering entitlement or discretionary spending, and/or raising taxes on high-net-worth individuals or corporations. Another is higher economic growth through productivity gains. Specifically, advancements in artificial intelligence could enhance fiscal sustainability by boosting economic output without causing inflation. The Congressional Budget Office does not, and has not historically, forecasted these types of productivity booms. The United States, France and other major economies are unlikely to put a brake on rising debt levels in the coming years, the credit rating agency S&amp;P Global has warned. The assessment comes ahead of elections in the UK, France and the US where political parties are promising to improve economies, social services and voters’ daily lives. S&amp;P said in a report: We estimate that – for the US, Italy and France – the primary balance would have to improve by more than 2% of GDP cumulatively for their debt to stabilise; this is unlikely to happen over the next three years. In our view, only a sharp deterioration of borrowing conditions could persuade G-7 governments to implement more resolute budgetary consolidation at the present stage in their electoral cycles. Here is our full story on eurozone inflation dipping in June: Inflation across the eurozone slowed to 2.5% in June despite lingering pressure on households from price increases in the service sector, leaving the European Central Bank on track to keep interest rates on hold this month. Annual inflation in consumer prices across the 20-country bloc eased from 2.6% in May, according to a flash estimate from the EU statistical agency Eurostat, matching financial market expectations. However, core inflation – which strips out food, energy, alcohol and tobacco – remained unchanged at 2.9%, marginally higher than predicted by economists in a reflection of stubborn inflationary pressures. Analysts said the figures were unlikely to encourage the ECB to cut interest rates again at its next policy meeting on 18 July, after it became the first big global central bank to reduce official borrowing costs, in June. Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at the Dutch bank ING, said: Nothing in these figures would make the ECB cut again in July, and we think it’ll be eagerly awaiting data over the summer before seriously debating a next rate cut in September. The summer is set to be relatively boring [for the ECB]. It can afford not to carry out another rate cut based on the too-high core inflation reading and labour market strength, and will likely just await incoming data on wages, inflation and growth. It can also see how market turmoil around the French elections plays out. In its flash estimate for June, Eurostat figures showed services had the highest annual inflation rate at 4.1%, a stable rate compared with May. Annual price growth for food, alcohol and tobacco slowed from 2.6% in May to 2.5%. US stock futures are falling, pointing to a lower open on Wall Street later –- ahead of jobs opening data at 3pm BST and US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell speaking at a European central banking conference at 2.30pm BST. The job openings and labour turnover survey, known as JOLTS, is expected to show job openings fell to 7.91m in May from 8.059m the month before. The Dow Jones is set to open nearly 150 points, or 0.4%, lower, while the Nasdaq is seen sliding 128 points, or 0.6% at the open, and the S&amp;P 50 is expected to lose 0.5%. Ahead of the UK’s general election on Thursday 4 July, Krispy Kreme said it would give away free doughnuts on the day. People visiting a Krispy Kreme shop in the UK on election day will get a free Original Glazed doughnut, simply by saying “I voted”. The offer will be valid on Thursday in all its shops nationwide “while stocks last”. The chain says it wants to encourage people to vote (while generating publicity for itself), in an election that will see a record number of candidates stand for the 650 parliamentary seats, and determine the UK’s next prime minister. The polls point to a massive win for the opposition Labour party, and its leader Keir Starmer is expected to succeed Rishi Sunak as prime minister. You can follow the latest in the UK election campaign here: Riccardo Marcelli Fabiani, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said: Inflation [in the eurozone] resumed its descent after it had been temporarily interrupted in May, and it will continue to fall as inflationary pressures wane thanks to easing wage growth, lower energy prices, and normalised price expectations. But core inflation remaining stable reminds us that the disinflationary process will be bumpy. Despite the decline in headline inflation, stubbornly high services inflation will cause headaches for the European Central Bank. This, its hawkish bias, and preoccupation for sticky wage growth point to no rate cut at the July meeting. European stocks have hit their lowest levels in two weeks, amid worries about the outcome of the French election and the outlook for eurozone interest rates following inflation data. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.6% to 509.99, with insurers down 2% and carmakers also among the biggest fallers. France’s CAC fell 0.75% to 7504, as investors awaited the second election round on 7 July. The German and Italian markets lost around 1%, while the UK’s FTSE 100 index was trading 0.3% lower. Yesterday, European stocks finished 0.3% higher, lifted by an 1.1% relief rally in the battered French stock market after Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party scored a smaller win than some polls had expected in the first round on Sunday -- reducing the chances of an absolute majority for the far-right party. Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, told Reuters: Both potential outcomes of this election, whether a far-right or a far-left coalition, don’t give political stability. Both would lead to a lot of indecision, which can cause some concern for investors. Today, Le Pen said “we wish to govern” but National Rally should only form a government if it can act. She also said that if it is a bit short, it will try to make up that majority with extra MPs, for example from the right. You can follow the latest on our French election blog. Eurozone inflation eased to a headline annual rate of 2.5% last month from 2.6% in May, while the closely-watched core rate that strips out volatile items such as food and energy held steady at 2.9%. Services inflation has remained stubbornly high at 4.1%, also unchanged from May. Jack Allen-Reynolds, eurozone economist at Capital Economics, said: The fact that services inflation, which is most sensitive to domestic economic conditions, has remained high this year strengthens the case for caution at the ECB. European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde said yesterday that benign economic developments suggest that further interest rate cuts are not urgent. The central bank lowered borrowing costs for the first time on 6 June. Lagarde told the ECB Forum on Central Banking, the bank’s hallmark policy conference in Sintra in Portugal: It will take time for us to gather sufficient data to be certain that the risks of above-target inflation have passed. The strong labour market means that we can take time to gather new information. Markets are pricing in a 50% chance of another quarter-point interest rate cut in September and an even lower chance of a further reduction in December. Lagarde and US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell are both speaking on a policy panel at the conference at 2.30pm BST today. European journalist Alex Taylor said on X: The boss of Sainsbury’s said Britain needs several interest rate cuts to stimulate consumer spending, particularly on non-essential things. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said: Customers are continuing to be cautious, particularly in the areas of discretionary spending. He said consumers’ caution was not surprising given everything households have been through in the cost of living crisis. Until we see sequential interest rate cuts, hopefully as soon as possible, that caution from consumers is going to continue on those more discretionary items. Roberts said when the weather improved, people spent more on things other than food. Last week, when Britain enjoyed a “mini-heatwave” Sainsbury’s sold more fans and cooling equipment than it had sold so far this year. It just shows that when the weather does turn, customers do want to buy into what they need to enjoy the summer. Sainsbury’s said shoppers continued to buy more items of food from its shelves than a year before but grocery sales growth slowed to 4.8% in the latest quarter from 7.3% in the previous quarter as inflation across the market eased. At its Argos chain, sales fell by 6.2%, even though it sold 25% more TVs than a year before as sports fans prepared to watch the men’s Euro 2024 football tournament. The retailer said the decline reflected “an unseasonal start to summer”, with cold and wet weather hitting sales of summer goods such as paddling pools and garden furniture that did well in a hot start to the summer last year. Services is estimated to have the highest annual rate in the eurozone in June, of 4.1% – stable compared with May. This is followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco at an annual rate of 2.5%, down from 2.6% in May; industrial goods at 0.7%, stable compared with May; and energy at 0.2%, down from May’s 0.3% rate. The unemployment rate stayed at 6.4% in May, unchanged from April, separate figures showed. Inflation in the eurozone slowed slightly last month, falling to 2.5% from 2.6% in May. However, the annual ‘core’ rate of inflation, which excludes food, alcohol, tobacco and energy which tend to be volatile, stayed at 2.9%, according to the official figures. Economists had expected it to dip to 2.8%. The ‘flash’ estimates were released by Eurostat, the European Commission’s statistics office. Revolut has reported record annual profits and further hinted at plans for a stock market flotation, despite still struggling to secure a UK banking licence. The London-based fintech company, which has been waiting more than three years for its UK licence to be approved, swung to a £438m profit in 2023, having made a £25m loss a year earlier. Profits were increased by higher interest rates and an ambitious expansion plan that helped to add 12 million customers to its user base last year. Revenues jumped 95% to £1.8bn in 2023, according to its latest annual report. But bosses have yet to convince regulators to grant the company a UK banking licence that would open the door to new income streams. A licence would allow Revolut to hold its customers’ deposits, which would help fund its own-branded loans and mortgages. It would also probably convince regulators in other key countries such as the US to follow suit. The challenge, in part, has been convincing regulators that Revolut has addressed a number of accounting and reputational concerns in recent years, after EU regulatory breaches, questions over its corporate culture and the late filing of its accounts. Revolut bosses made little reference to the UK application, which was first lodged in early 2021, in its latest annual report, saying only: “We are continuing to work closely with the [Prudential Regulation Authority] on our UK bank licence application.” However, Revolut – which was valued at $33bn in 2021 – gave further hints that it was on track for what is expected to be a bumper initial public offering (IPO) It insisted in its annual report that it had “enhanced” its financial controls in ways expected of “listed companies”. It comes a year after the auditor BDO said it had been unable to get a full picture of Revolut’s revenue, and warned that as a result, the company’s finances were at risk of being “materially misstated.” Here is our full story on Sainsbury’s: Shares in the Shoe Zone lost nearly a fifth of their value after the shoe retailer downgraded its profit forecast again, blaming higher shipping costs due to Red Sea disruption and poor weather. The shares fell as low as 120p and later traded down 16% at 130p. The retailer now expects adjusted profit before tax for the year to 2 October to be around £10m. It had already cut its profit outlook to £13.8m in May, as it was hit by shipping delays and higher wage costs following the National Living Wage increase. Today, Shoe Zone said container prices had risen “significantly” over the last six months, as a result of the reduction in the number of shipping vessels and the additional costs of rerouting away from the traditional Suez Canal route. Alongside this, spring and summer sales had been weaker than expected between April and June due to “unseasonal weather conditions”. Last week, the company was hit by a cyber attack when hackers gained “unauthorised access to certain online systems and data”. Its website has remained operational and Shoe Zone has continued to trade with its customers and suppliers. Britain’s next government is poised to benefit from easing pressure on household finances after a slowdown in inflation in stores and a fall in fuel prices, but costs remain “too expensive” for many families. Figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show that annual UK shop price inflation cooled last month to 0.2%, down from 0.6% in May – the slowest pace since October 2021 – as retailers cut the prices of many of their key products, including butter and coffee. Coming before Thursday’s general election, separate figures from the RAC show that petrol and diesel prices fell for a second straight month in June to ease pressure on families affected by the cost of living crisis. The organisation said, however, that filling up on the forecourt was still “too expensive” in England, Wales and Scotland. According to the RAC’s monthly fuel watch, the average price of petrol in the UK at the end of June was just under 145p a litre, down from 148p at the start of the month. Diesel dropped from nearly 154p to about 150p. “Fuel prices are still nowhere near where they should be despite falling for the second consecutive month,” the RAC said. It highlighted the lower cost of filling up in Northern Ireland, where petrol is 4.5p a litre cheaper on average and diesel 8p cheaper than in the rest of the UK. The RAC’s head of policy, Simon Williams, said: While it’s good news prices at the pumps have fallen for the second month in a row, this also leaves a bad taste in the mouth because we know drivers in Great Britain are continuing to get a raw deal as both petrol and diesel are still much more expensive than in Northern Ireland. Sainsbury’s is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index this morning, down 3.3% at 249.60p. Overall, the UK’s blue-chip index has fallen 0.6% or 52 points to 8114.91. European stocks also pulled back ahead of the eurozone inflation data. Germany’s Dax has lost 0.5% while France’s CAC has lost 0.7% and Italy’s FTSE MiB slid 0.6%. Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the “Arogs albatross neck around its neck can’t be ignored”. At first glance, it’s a bit tough to work out what sort of results have landed in Sainsbury’s bagging area. Ultimately, the reduction in the rate of growth was partly to be expected, especially in grocery. As inflation cools, the weather worsens and tough comparisons crop up on the course, eking out the amount of growth seen last year was always a difficult ask. But there is a lingering Sainsbury’s specific issue in its ownership of Argos. Electronics aren’t faring well in this economic climate, as people prioritise the essentials. General merchandise is the most cyclical area of the supermarket economy to be in, so being overweight in this arena really slows you down when times get tough. The additional exposure offsets and hides what has been a remarkable showing for the core grocery business. Sainsbury’s was having a bit of an identity crisis, straddling the more vulnerable middle-line between premium and value. An awful lot of work has gone into improving products, value perception and innovation more generally, giving the group enough gusto to start moving market share in the right direction. AI ambitions to improve real-time customer service and experience are grand but a bit thin on detail, so an area to watch. Investors are also being rewarded for their patience, with at least £250m making its way back to them once the sale of Sainsbury’s Bank assets to NatWest has completed. Overall, Sainsbury’s has done just about all it can to better itself and it should be commended for that, but the Argos albatross around its neck can’t be ignored. Analysts at Jefferies led by Frederick Wild and James Grzinic talked of an “exceptionally strong grocery performance” at Sainsbury’s. An exceptionally strong grocery performance at Sainsbury’s in Q1 was diluted by a more downbeat delivery in the general merchandise businesses, particularly Argos. This should represent the trough, which feels well understood by the market given the shares’ recent underperformance. Sunnier weather in recent weeks should underpin… acceleration, with the chief drivers through the rest of the year an improving consumer environment and an easing [year-on-year] comparative. Grocery total growth remaining very strong at 4.8% as inflation stabilised, mix began to improve, and market share gains continued. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Sales at Sainsbury’s have slowed despite a 25% jump in people buying TVs during Euro 2024, partly because of a big drop in sales at its Argos chain. Food inflation has eased, and the supermarket group battled a “tough trading backdrop” on clothing and general merchandise amid poor weather and the cost of living crisis. Like-for-like sales (at stores open at least a year), excluding fuel, slowed to 2.7% in the 16 weeks to 22 June, from 4.8% in the previous quarter. Food sales growth eased to 4.8% from 7.3% as inflation across the market eased. Argos sales plunged by 6.2% in the latest quarter, because people bought less garden furniture, paddling pools and other seasonal products than last year due to cold and wet weather. Sales electronics such as video games were also weak. Sainsbury’s said: Consumers continue to shop general merchandise more cautiously but respond to value. More positive signs are coming through now in general merchandise with the better weather and the Summer of Sport ramping up. As the warm weather hit last week, people immediately stocked up on cooling and garden products. Sainsbury’s said it sold more fans in one week than it had in the year to date. Thanks to the euros, TV sales have surged, as fans upgraded to better sets ahead of the big matches. The supermarket chain stuck to its forecast of a retail underlying operating profit of between £1.01bn and £1.06bn this year, up between 5% and 10% from last year. Later this morning, we’ll be getting ‘flash’ inflation figures for June from the eurozone. Inflation in the 20-nation eurozone is expected to have fallen slightly, to 2.5% from 2.6% in May. Eurostat, the European Commission’s office, will release the data at 10am BST. The core rate, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, is forecast to have eased to 2.8% from 2.9%.

        "title": "‘I totally understand why people are sceptical’: the co-founder of collapsed energy giant Bulb on his new venture",
        "content": "Britain’s fast-changing energy industry may be just the place for reinvention. In the wake of the unprecedented collapse of Bulb Energy, its co-founder, Amit Gudka, is trying to make the best of his next chapter: by plugging into the global battery boom. Sitting in a central London coffee shop, not far from the offices of his new venture, Field Energy, Gudka explains how he has swapped home energy customers for battery projects and why he believes he should be given a second chance. It has been almost three years since Bulb Energy became Britain’s biggest gas and electricity supplier to go bust amid a string of more than 20 company collapses – leaving taxpayers holding what looked to be a £6.5bn bill – and one year since Gudka successfully raised £200m for his new battery storage startup. Gudka, 40, says he understands that there may be former Bulb customers who wonder whether he should be running another energy company. Some energy insiders share that scepticism after Bulb’s incredible rise (courting the likes of Boris Johnson on the way) and costly collapse left a deep stain on the energy supply industry. “I can completely understand that scepticism,” he says. “When you set up a second business, you’ve already learned a hell of a lot from the first time around. There are also a lot of learnings to take away from what happened at Bulb to take into a new business as well.” The energy entrepreneur left Bulb months before the company’s stratospheric rise came to an abrupt end in the autumn of 2021 as energy market prices soared to record highs, pushing the company into special government administration. Bulb had been the brainchild of co-founders Gudka and Hayden Wood. Gudka – a gas and electricity trader at Barclays and a DJ who ran the Man Make Music record label and club night – teamed up with Wood to launch Bulb in 2015 in the wake of a shake-up of the market by energy regulator Ofgem that was designed to encourage competition. Wood courted the limelight, evangelising about how Bulb would disrupt the lumbering energy supply market with slick tech and renewable energy, while Gudka was less public. The pair cashed out £4m each in shares in 2018. The collapse sent shockwaves through the industry, casting Bulb’s 1.6 million customers and its 650 staff into uncertainty and threatening to saddle the government with more than £4bn in costs – a figure that had risen to £6.5bn by November 2022 as wholesale prices soared further amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As energy market prices have come down, the cost of the collapse has fallen. It is now expected to be “fiscally neutral” for the government after Octopus Energy was allowed to buy its erstwhile rival with the promise that it would pay the government back almost £3bn of state support. For Gudka, the collapse of the company is still a sore point. “It was hard. It was pretty devastating,” he says, weighing each word carefully. He pauses. “I think anyone who has built a business and then seen it fail – whether you’re in it, or out of it – there’s a lot of emotional attachment. It was very sad. And even harder for the employees who were still there.” Gudka had left the company nine months before its coffers ran dry, but he was still on the board of Bulb Energy’s parent company at the time of the administration and was involved in the process of winding the business down. The process is expected to complete this September. “In the end, I think it was a good outcome for Bulb’s employees. It was a really great team and I was still in touch with a lot of them after I left,” he says. There are no warm words for co-founder Wood. The pair, who built what was once Britain’s fastest growing startup and a darling of senior government figures, have had scant contact beyond Gudka’s attendance at quarterly board meetings. “That was the extent of our contact. I see him at industry events and stuff,” he adds. The apparent coolness between the pair has fuelled industry rumour that Gudka’s departure followed a falling-out. Gudka swiftly moved on, alighting on a different corner of the energy market that he saw as ripe for disruption: the growing market for storing renewable energy. Today, Field, which is registered as Virmati Energy, operates a 20 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery site in Oldham, Greater Manchester, that can provide enough electricity to power more than two-thirds of the town’s households for one hour if called on to do so. It has another 20MWh battery project in Gerrards Cross, south Buckinghamshire, which began operation in April 2024, and a construction pipeline of projects totalling 390MWh. The business is also looking at opportunities in Spain, Italy and Germany. Gudka characterises the move into the booming market for batteries as a return to his longstanding interests in the mechanics of Britain’s energy market. The Cambridge University graduate was a keen observer of Britain’s energy generation capacity in his trading job at Barclays for almost seven years before he left to establish Bulb Energy. “This brings together a lot of my energy market experience,” he says. “It had been in my mind for quite a while and by 2020 we had a glimpse at how important it is to scale up this technology.” This was, notably, the year upended by the Covid-19 pandemic. For energy markets, the lockdown restrictions caused a sudden slump in energy demand and meant that the UK’s green electricity supplies threatened to overload the grid. That provided a temporary preview of a grid system run mostly on renewables and the importance of battery technology to store wind and solar power. Gudka says his departure was discussed with Bulb’s board and agreed in October 2020. It was announced the following February, only a few months before a sharp rally in market prices drove its costs well beyond what it could sustain. “The intention was to leave with everything on a stable footing,” he says. “The audit has just been signed off, there was a rolling hedging policy in place, a sizeable team and the fundraising process had been kicked off. There is always risk in business but at this point things felt pretty stable.” Gudka believes that Bulb would have survived the energy crisis – which also wiped scores of other, smaller suppliers from the market – if the timing of its final fundraising process had been sooner. “If it had started three months earlier, it probably would have been closed by the time the markets really started moving. At that point credit lines were pulled and it was the lack of credit in the end which ultimately led to this outcome,” he says. Tellingly, the top lessons that Gudka says he has taken into his latest company are both financial: strong financial management and very healthy capital headroom. He says his first move in setting up his new business, in which he holds a minority stake, was to hire a chief financial officer. He has also raised £235m in equity and £40m in debt, which he says is more than enough to carry out its plans. Field was first backed by London-based Giant Ventures in 2021. It then raised a £77m round in 2022 – £30m in equity and £47m in debt. Its equity backers included Plural and LocalGlobe, while the debt facility came from Triple Point Energy Efficiency Infrastructure. Last year, it raised a further £200m from DIF Capital Partners. “We’re staying ahead of the curve in terms of capital-raising,” he says. Gudka believes investing in batteries puts him ahead of the curve on Britain’s electricity system overhaul too – and perhaps even on the road to his own reinvention.

        "title": "Sainsbury’s sales growth slows as poor weather hits non-food ranges",
        "content": "Sainsbury’s has said sales growth slowed in recent weeks as food inflation eased and consumers shopped “more cautiously” amid poor weather and the cost of living crisis. Sales at established stores rose 3% in the three months to 22 June compared with a rise of 4.8% in the previous quarter, excluding fuel and the impact of the closure of the group’s Irish Argos stores. At Argos, sales fell by 6.2% in the quarter – worse than the 4.7% decline in the previous three months – despite selling 25% more TVs than a year before as sports fans prepared to watch the men’s Euro 2024 football tournament. The retailer said the decline reflected “an unseasonal start to summer”, with cold and wet weather hitting sales of summer goods such as paddling pools and garden furniture that did well in a hot start to the summer last year. Electronics sales were weaker amid softer demand, particularly games, in what it called “a tough trading backdrop”. “Consumers continue to shop general merchandise more cautiously,” it said, adding that shoppers were responding where it had offered discounts. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said consumers’ caution was “not surprising given everything households have been through in the cost of living crisis. Until we see sequential interest rate cuts, hopefully as soon as possible, that caution from consumers is going to continue on those more discretionary items.” “People want more certainty that the cost of owning a home is going to come down,” he said. UK inflation fell to 2% in May, returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years. Roberts said he thought inflation had now stabilised in the low single digits and Sainsbury’s was increasing prices at a slower pace than the wider grocery market. However, he said price rises would continue due to increasing wage bills and problems in the Red Sea where attacks on shipping have forced up costs and caused delays. Roberts said he hoped a turn in the weather would release “pent up demand” for summer items. The group sold more electric fans during the warm spell in the last week of June than in the rest of the year so far and paddling pool sales have doubled. Asked if he thought a change of government would boost trade, Roberts said he had been “really encouraged by the willingness to engage with business” from the two main parties in the election, adding that there was an “urgent need for reform of business rates” to support the retail industry. Sainsbury’s said shoppers continued to buy more items of food than a year before but grocery sales growth fell to 4.8% from 7.3% in the previous quarter as inflation across the market eased. Roberts said the group continued to win market share every month as more people chose its supermarkets for their big weekly shop. The group’s online offering is proving particularly popular – 14% of sales were sold this way during the period, up 1 percentage point on the average last year – and there was an 80% rise in demand for its rapid delivery service. Analysts said Sainsbury’s growth was in line with expectations as households continued to struggle with higher bills including energy, mortgages and rent. “Given the unfavourable weather in the UK, weak performance in clothing was expected, especially as Sainsbury’s focuses more on assortment and less promotion,” said William Woods at Bernstein. Sophie Lund-Yates, the lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “As inflation cools, the weather worsens and tough comparisons crop up on the course, eking out the amount of growth seen last year was always a difficult ask. “But there is a lingering Sainsbury’s specific issue in its ownership of Argos. Electronics aren’t faring well in this economic climate as people prioritise the essentials.”",

        "title": "Eurozone inflation eases but ECB likely to keep interest rates on hold",
        "content": "Inflation across the eurozone slowed to 2.5% in June despite lingering pressure on households from price increases in the service sector, leaving the European Central Bank on track to keep interest rates on hold this month. Annual inflation in consumer prices across the 20-country bloc eased from 2.6% in May, according to a flash estimate from the EU statistical agency Eurostat, matching financial market expectations. However, core inflation – which strips out food, energy, alcohol and tobacco – remained unchanged at 2.9%, marginally higher than predicted by economists in a reflection of stubborn inflationary pressures. Analysts said the figures were unlikely to encourage the ECB to cut interest rates again at its next policy meeting on 18 July, after it became the first big global central bank to reduce official borrowing costs, in June. “Nothing in these figures would make the ECB cut again in July, and we think it’ll be eagerly awaiting data over the summer before seriously debating a next rate cut in September,” said Bert Colijn, the senior eurozone economist at the Dutch bank ING. “The summer is set to be relatively boring [for the ECB]. It can afford not to carry out another rate cut based on the too-high core inflation reading and labour market strength, and will likely just await incoming data on wages, inflation and growth. It can also see how market turmoil around the French elections plays out.” In its flash estimate for June, Eurostat figures showed services had the highest annual inflation rate at 4.1%, a stable rate compared with May. Annual price growth for food, alcohol and tobacco slowed from 2.6% in May to 2.5%. Riccardo Marcelli Fabiani, a senior economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said: “Inflation resumed its descent after it had been temporarily interrupted in May, and it will continue to fall as inflationary pressures wane thanks to easing wage growth, lower energy prices and normalised price expectations. But core inflation remaining stable reminds us that the disinflationary process will be bumpy.” The ECB cut its main deposit rate last month to 3.75% from a record high of 4%, putting it ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have yet to cut interest rates. It was the first time that the main eurozone interest rate had been reduced in almost five years. However, the central bank’s president, Christine Lagarde, said on Monday that benign economic developments suggest that further interest rate cuts are not urgent, with a robust labour market and resilient wage growth. The latest figures come as European stocks fell on Tuesday to the lowest level in two weeks, amid worries about the outcome of the French election and heightened economic uncertainty across the eurozone. Pierre Roke, a senior analyst at Validus Risk Management, said rising political uncertainty and inflationary pressures could force the ECB to keep rates on hold for longer than anticipated in financial markets, where traders are poised for a second rate cut in September. A second rate cut “feels ambitious”, he said. “We certainly see higher rates as a bigger risk from here than lower.”",

        "title": "Revolut reports record profits as it hints at plans for IPO",
        "content": "Revolut has reported record annual profits and further hinted at plans for a stock market flotation, despite still struggling to secure a UK banking licence. The London-based fintech company, which has been waiting more than three years for its UK licence to be approved, swung to a £438m profit in 2023, having made a £25m loss a year earlier. Profits were increased by higher interest rates and an ambitious expansion plan that helped to add 12 million customers to its user base last year. Revenues jumped 95% to £1.8bn in 2023, according to its latest annual report. But bosses have yet to persuade regulators to grant the company a UK banking licence that would open the door to new income streams. A licence would allow Revolut to hold its customers’ deposits, which would help fund its own-branded loans and mortgages. It would also probably persuade regulators in other key countries such as the US to follow suit. The challenge, in part, has been convincing regulators that Revolut has addressed a number of accounting and reputational concerns in recent years, after EU regulatory breaches, questions over its corporate culture and the late filing of its accounts. Revolut bosses made little reference in its latest annual report to the UK application, which was lodged in early 2021, saying only: “We are continuing to work closely with the [Prudential Regulation Authority] on our UK bank licence application.” However, Revolut – which was valued at $33bn in 2021 – gave further hints that it was on track for a bumper initial public offering (IPO). It said in its annual report that it had “enhanced” its financial controls in ways expected of “listed companies”. It comes a year after the auditor BDO said it had been unable to get a full picture of Revolut’s revenue, and warned that as a result the company’s finances were at risk of being “materially misstated”. Revolut said it had focused on improving its processes throughout 2023 in a way that allowed BDO to “increase their understanding of the business” and release its financial results earlier, having previously faced significant delays. “We are pleased that Revolut’s transformation programme has now enabled us to return to a regular financial reporting schedule,” Revolut said. “We are confident we have set solid foundations that, in the long run, will support our expanding banking operations and will bring our financial processes in line with the standards expected from publicly listed companies.” Revolut more than tripled the salary of its highest-paid director, believed to be the founder and chief executive Nik Storonsky, to £333,000 from £100,00 a year earlier. However, his overall pay plunged 97% due a big share payout in 2022 that took his total pay to £17.8m that year. That figure fell to £378,000 in 2023. Revolut’s annual report showed that its highest-paid director was paid £378,000 last year. A spokesperson for the company said the individual was not Stornosky but that it could not comment on individual employees’ pay. • This article was amended on 11 July 2024 to reflect clarification provided by Revolut to the Guardian post-publication.",

        "title": "Tata cancels early closure of Port Talbot furnaces after Unite calls off strike",
        "content": "The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks, Tata Steel, has cancelled plans to begin shutting down both of the plant’s blast furnaces this week after Unite called off a strike, but cutbacks expected to cost 2,800 jobs will still go ahead later this year. Members of the union were scheduled to begin industrial action on 8 July, days after Indian-owned Tata began a wind-down process that will ultimately end more than 70 years of making steel from scratch at the plant. On Monday, however, Unite confirmed it had cancelled its strike plans after Rajesh Nair, the UK boss of Tata Steel, wrote to unions over the weekend to offer a further round of discussions about future investments at the south Wales site. Unite said Tata had confirmed that “it was now prepared to enter into negotiations about future investment for its operations and not just redundancies”. The union’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steelmaking in south Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site. “This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steelmaking ended and their communities were laid to waste. “It is essential that these talks progress swiftly and in good faith with the focus on fresh investment and ensuring the long-term continuation of steelmaking in south Wales.” Tata Steel had originally planned to begin shutting down Port Talbot’s blast furnace No 5 this week, with No 4 slated for closure in September. It brought forward the second half of the plan to this week in response to Unite calling the strike, saying it could not operate the site safely without enough workers. On Monday, however, Tata Steel said it had received written confirmation that industrial action would not go ahead. A spokesperson said: “As a result, and given we can now be confident of ensuring appropriate resourcing of activities to operate safely, we will halt preparations for the early cessation of operations on blast furnace 4 and the wider heavy end in Port Talbot, planned for this week. We welcome the fact that we have avoided having to progress down this path. “The resumption of discussions with the UK Steel Committee [which represents the Community, Unite and the GMB unions] will progress from the position reached in the last meeting of 22 May and will focus on the future investments and aspirations for the business, and not on a renegotiation of our existing plan for the heavy-end closure or the enhanced employment support terms. “The wind-down process for blast furnace 5 has now begun to plan and we expect to produce the final iron at the end of this week.” Community, which represents more steelworkers than Unite and has often disagreed with its sister union over how to protect Port Talbot workers, welcomed the decision. “Tata confirmed that if the strike was called off they are ready to resume discussions on a potential [memorandum of understanding], through the multi-union steel committee, which is chaired by Community,” said Alun Davies, a national officer for the organisation. “The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May. “With thousands of jobs at stake, we welcome Unite’s decision to withdraw their strike action and get back around the table with their sister steel unions.” The new electric furnace is not due to come onstream until 2027 and unions want steelmaking to continue until then.",

        "title": "Austerity was a disastrous political choice that we are still reeling from | Letters",
        "content": "Paul Krugman (How the ‘unforced error’ of austerity wrecked Britain, 28 June) hits the nail on the head when he says that there was no economic case for the austerity that the coalition government foisted on us in 2010, the effects of which are still with us. It was a political choice on the part of George Osborne and David Cameron to advance their class interest, cleverly camouflaged by stories of Labour profligacy when the economic crisis to which it was the alleged response was caused by a surfeit of financial deregulation advocated by Osborne and Cameron and supinely accepted by Labour. The American political economist Clara E Mattei, in her 2022 book, The Capital Order: How Economists Invented Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism, showed how similar policies were applied in Britain and Italy after the first world war, essentially to keep workers in their place, and how in Italy they led to the rise of Mussolini and fascism. Let us be warned. Prof Roger Brown Southampton • Paul Krugman is right about the impact of austerity on the UK economy – here are a couple of reasons why. First, those who advocate the shrinking of the state fail to appreciate how the economy is interdependent. Most public authorities require tendering for services. Generally, the private or voluntary sectors get the tender. So if the public sector is starved of finance and catches a cold, the private and voluntary sectors start to sneeze too. Second, the assumption is that if the public sector is smaller, the private sector will take up the slack. This ignores the fact that the private sector’s bottom line is its profitability and ability to satisfy its shareholders, not the public interest. In practice, this means that the private sector will cherry-pick the easy and profitable tasks, as with the failed privatisation of the probation service, while leaving anything difficult or unprofitable to the public sector. Alternatively, as with the failed privatisation of the railways, the private sector demands subsidies out of our taxes so that it can pay a dividend to its shareholders, thereby taking money out of the system that could otherwise be used to improve the infrastructure, reduce fares, or both. Austerity was an ideological choice by the coalition government. While I would have expected little better from the Conservatives, I would have hoped that their Liberal Democrat coalition partners would have drawn enough red lines to prevent the government from following through on its economic illiteracy and choking off the first signs of recovery from the 2007-08 crash. As it is, we’ve suffered from the consequences ever since. Dave Pollard Leicester • Paul Krugman does an excellent job of exposing the disastrous consequences of 14 years of austerity for both society and the economy. But in solely blaming the Tories, he neglects to acknowledge the role of the Liberal Democrats in both enabling austerity and even co-authoring the genesis of the policy through the key role played by the then chief secretary to the Treasury David Laws. Although in post for only a short time, his role was pivotal in developing the first drastic cuts in public expenditure. We now live with the consequences of 14 years of monetarist dogma ruthlessly, pitilessly and unfairly applied.

        "title": "Thames Water accused of ‘chicanery’ over £150m dividend payment",
        "content": "Thames Water has been urged to show greater transparency over its finances and accused of “financial chicanery” after it emerged its board had approved a £150m dividend hours before its shareholders U-turned on providing emergency funding. The Guardian revealed last week that the board of the struggling water supplier agreed to the payout at a meeting on 27 March. The following day, the debt-laden company said its investors were no longer willing to provide £500m of funding they had previously pledged, raising the prospect that the company may be temporarily nationalised. Thames Water made no mention of the dividend payment at that point. The water industry regulator, Ofwat, planned to investigate the circumstances around the dividend paid by Thames, sources said. The company was already under investigation over its decision to pay a separate £37.5m dividend at the time the £150m dividend was paid. Britain’s biggest water supplier said the payment was made from the regulated company to an intermediate parent company, Kemble Water Eurobond, to “settle a pension top-up payment” and “surrender relief” on tax losses. Gary Carter, GMB national officer, said: “Thames Water has once again shown an alarming lack of transparency. “Of course GMB wants our members’ pension pots to get back in the black – but shareholders should be topping it up. “Instead they’re taking money out of the regulated company, money needed to stop spills and pay our members’ wages.” He added: “Thames Water needs to front up about its financial chicanery, while shareholders need to cough up to fill the pensions black hole – not customers or taxpayers.” The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney, who has called for Thames Water to be put into special administration by the government and for it to be reformed as a public benefit company, said: “This is a scandalous payout while our rivers are polluted with sewage and the company stands on the brink of bankruptcy. “It is concrete evidence of why we need to abolish Ofwat and create a new water regulator with real teeth and power. “The public will never forgive the Conservative party for how they have let water firms get away with financial mismanagement and environmental vandalism.” Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green party of England and Wales, said: “The further revelations about Thames Water further prove that the experiment of a privatised water system has fundamentally failed. “At a time when our rivers are choked with sewage and water pipes are at bursting point, it’s unconscionable that water companies continue to prioritise payouts over their responsibilities to the public and the environment.” The campaigner and former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey said: “The dividend illustrates yet again the utter contempt and disdain that the water industry treats regulators and the politicians that oversee it with. “Ofwat seems to have no ability to control them. There is an arrogance and contempt towards customers and regulators – that’s what happens when you have a company operating a monopoly with no proper oversight.” The £150m did not reach external Thames shareholders but did leave the ringfenced portion of the group’s complex corporate structure. Ofwat has been clamping down on the flow of cash from ringfenced water companies to holding companies, amid concerns that payouts are weakening the finances of regulated water companies. Ofwat is due to publish its draft response to water firms’ five-year business plans on 11 July. Thames’s annual results need to be published by 15 July. Thames Water has been approached for comment.",

        "title": "Port Talbot steel union suspends strike; French share prices jump after elections – as it happened",
        "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron made a big gamble to call early parliamentary elections. Markets have spent much of today trying to work out the consequences, as the far right National Rally (RN) appears to be on course to be the largest party in France. Macron’s bet has “backfired badly”, according to Philippe Ledent, a senior economist at ING, an investment bank. The outcome will depend on how many “triangular” races are made into referendums on the far right, ahead of Sunday’s second round. The third French candidates have about 26 hours to decide whether to withdraw in their seats and make the votes head-to-head battles between RN and an alternative. Ledent writes: Alliances and voting instructions will play a major role in the coming hours. The authorities of the parties making up the NFP are asking their candidates who came third in a constituency where the RN is present in the second round to withdraw in favour of the candidate opposed to the RN. President Macron and prime minister Attal seem to be moving in the same direction for their party’s third-place candidates. However, other centrist and right-wing politicians have explicitly ruled out standing aside to allow in far-left candidates. For investors the prospect of a hung parliament could temper the more radical policies of the far right and the leftwing coalition. French share prices duly rallied, and the spread between French and German bonds narrowed. In other business and economics news: The Unite union has suspended a strike at Port Talbot steelworks, saying that Tata Steel has opened the way to talks on future investment. It puts Unite in line with other unions representing steelworkers, and means a potential Labour government could have a say over the plant’s future. The shipbuilder Harland &amp; Wolff has been forced to temporarily suspend trading in its shares after accounting issues meant it was unable to file audited accounts on time. The European Commission has accused Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta of breaching the EU’s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram. Boeing has agreed a $4.7bn (£3.7bn) deal to buy the parts supplier Spirit Aerosystems that it sold nearly 20 years ago, as it seeks to improve safety on its production lines after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines-operated plane mid-flight earlier this year. Politicians in Northern Ireland are concerned over the future of a Belfast factory that will be sold to Airbus as part of the deal. House prices in the UK remain unaffordable for many households despite wages rising above inflation for the typical earner, Nationwide has said. German inflation has dropped slightly more than expected to 2.2% year-on-year in June, bolstering the case for the European Central Bank to cut interest rates again. You can continue to follow our live coverage from around the world: In our French election coverage, first-round results give far-right alliance 33% of vote, as PM warns Le Pen at ‘gates of power In our UK election coverage, Ed Davey uses bungee jump to urge voters to ‘do something you’ve never done before and vote Lib Dem’ In our coverage of the Gaza crisis, al-Shifa hospital director release sparks row in Israel; army needs 10,000 soldiers, Israel defence minister says In the US, the supreme court is to issue Trump immunity decision Northern Irish politicians have raised concerns over the future of as many as 1,400 workers at the Spirit Aerosystems factory in Belfast, after its takeover by planemaker Airbus. Boeing has announced the takeover of Spirit Aerosystems as it tries to retake control of its supply chain following a series of production issues. As part of that deal Airbus will take over Spirit operations serving it, including in Belfast which makes wings and fuselages for the small A220 jet. However, the Unite union has said that 40% of the 3,600 workforce is employed on parts that are not related to Airbus projects, including work for Bombardier and Rolls-Royce. Airbus did not say whether it plans to continue that work. Local politicians are concerned that job losses may result at an historic factory that traces its history back to Short Brothers, the first company to make production aircraft. First minister Michelle O’Neill and deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly released statements in which they said the government was working with the company to preserve the Belfast operations. Economy minister Conor Murphy said: “I have been engaging with the company and union on the acquisition and will work with all key stakeholders to ensure that the future status of the highly skilled workforce is protected.” Reuters reported: The leader of Northern Ireland’s largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party’s (DUP) Gavin Robinson, said the sale represented only “a partial solution”. Steve Aiken, a member of the smaller Ulster Unionist Party, said it was an outcome “neither management, workforce or the unions desired”, calling on Northern Ireland’s economy minister to intervene to ensure the entire business is retained. “The minister also needs to emphasis to Airbus the considerable investment the Northern Irish and UK governments have made in wing and aerostructure manufacturing in Belfast and that we will not be allowing our aircraft industry to be asset stripped and manufacturing moved elsewhere,” Aiken added. German inflation has dropped slightly more than expected to 2.2% year-on-year in June, as the European Central Bank (ECB) considers whether to cut interest rates again. It dropped from 2.4% in May, and was slightly lower than the 2.3% forecast. The ECB has a 2% inflation target, but it has cut borrowing costs because it believes that inflationary pressure is easing. A further reduction in inflation could support that view. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, a Dutch investment bank, said the reading keeps the door open to further ECB rate cuts, but added that inflation “remains sticky above 2%. He wrote: Looking ahead, the stickiness of inflation at slightly too high a level looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects are petering out while, at the same time, wages are increasing. With recent new wage demands, it is hard to see German wage growth coming down in the second half of the year. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, a September cut is likely. He said: said: Looking further ahead for Germany, we see scope for a further decline in headline inflation to below 2% by August, helping to get a 25 basis point rate cut over the line in September, before a rebound to just under 2.5% by the end of the year. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has breached the EU’s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission. Meta launched a “pay or consent” model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc’s data privacy rules, where users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes, writes the Guardian’s Dan Milmo. Users who do not pay have, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, consented to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds. The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, said the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act, which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into “pay or consent” on Monday and found the model “forces users to consent” to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the “with adverts” versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said. You can read the full story here: Unite the union has said that Tata Steel will enter talks about “future investment for its operations and not just redundancies”, after suspending strikes. Other unions have complained that there has been no progress in the last six weeks, but Unite suggested that Tata had changed stance. Tata has stuck to its position that the two blast furnaces must close this year. However, a plan backed by counterpart unions Community and GMB suggested keeping one furnace open for longer while readying a large investment in greener technology (such as a direct reduced iron plant) to convert iron ore to iron, which could then be fed into an electric arc furnace. That plan would preserve jobs on the blast furnaces for several years, and would then require more workers to run in the longer term – although nowhere near the 2,800 employees who could be out of work by the autumn. Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary, said: This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steel making in South Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site. This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste. It is essential that these talks progress swiftly and in good faith with the focus on fresh investment and ensuring the long-term continuation of steel making in South Wales. Tata Steel had written to the three main unions representing steelworkers at Port Talbot offering more talks over its plans to cut 2,800 jobs as it closes the blast furnaces if the strike threat were removed. The unions are hopeful that a Labour government would persuade Tata Steel to delay the closure of at least one blast furnace, preserving thousands of jobs for several years. Unite had threatened strike action from 8 July – after the planned closure of the first blast furnace. The other unions were hanging on for a Labour government after 4 July. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has already been in talks with the unions and the company in an effort to avert the closures. Alun Davies, national officer for Community, which represents most of the affected steelworkers, said: With thousands of jobs at stake, we welcome Unite’s decision to withdraw their strike action and get back around the table with their sister steel unions. Tata confirmed that if the strike was called off they are ready to resume discussions on a potential [memorandum of understanding], through the multi-union steel committee which is chaired by Community. The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May. A union representing some workers at Tata Steel’s works in Port Talbot, south Wales, has suspended strikes after talks with the company. Unite union is understood to have suspended the strike threat after high-level talks between union officials and the company. Tata plans to close two blast furnaces at the site and shift towards much cleaner electric arc furnaces. However, unions want them to delay the closure – the first of which is due this week – to await a Labour government. Labour has said it will offer significant extra state subsidy to the steel industry, above the £500m deal agreed with Tata Steel by the Conservative government. A full statement from Unite is expected shortly. There has been a rush of manufacturing data today. The UK’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) from S&amp;P Global suggests it is doing better than Europe. The PMI reading came in at 50.9 in June, still well into expansionary territory, in contrast to the two-year contraction in Europe. The reading was worse than the initial flash estimate of 51.4, and down slightly from May’s 22-month high of 51.2. Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May’s recent highs. The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins. In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe. However, that did not stop companies from making job and spending cuts and trying to run down inventories of unsold products, Dobson said. Inflation may be partly behind that: This is coming from a backdrop of renewed cost inflation pressure, with manufacturers’ input prices now rising at the quickest pace since the start of 2023. This renewed upward lurch in manufacturing prices will likely add to concerns over the potential stubbornness of underlying inflationary pressures among hawkish rate setters at the Bank of England. It’s a big news day for what remains of Northern Irish manufacturing: first, we had the news that Airbus will take over the historic Shorts aerospace operation from Spirit Aerosystems. And now there are renewed questions over the future of the nearby Harland &amp; Wolff site, after its shares were suspended on the London’s junior stock market. It has been forced to temporarily suspend trading in its shares after accounting issues meant it was unable to file audited accounts on time, the Guardian’s Jack Simpson reports. It expects to publish the accounts in the week commencing 8 July, with share trading resuming at that point. The Belfast-based shipbuilder was plunged into uncertainty last month when it was reported that the UK government was witholding the approval of a £200m loan guarantee promised in December to shore up its finances. You can read the full report here: France’s Cac 40 index has moderated somewhat: the index is now up by 1.5%. That is still a notable move, but less than the nearly 3% surge earlier. The euro is up by 0.5% today against the US dollar at $1.0766. A hung parliament would make it more difficult for either the far-right National Rally (RN) or the leftwing New Popular Front coalition to win a majority and increase spending. Some economists fear that a spending spree could prompt investors to dump French assets. The chart below is what the pre-election move looked like in the bond markets. The yield on French bonds (which moves inversely to prices) had risen to a seven-month high before the election. The gap between the yield on French and German debt had also soared, although it closed after the slightly lower than expected vote share for the RN over the weekend. Via Reuters: The spread between French and German 10-year sovereign bond yields a gauge for the risk premium investors demand to hold French bonds – tightened to 73 basis points (bps), after hitting 85.2 on Friday, its highest level since July 2012. It was less than 50 bps the days before Macron called for snap elections. However, even if the spread narrowed, the yield on French 10-year debt still rose to its highest since November. The yield hit a high of 3.334% on Monday, up from 3.135 before French President Emmanuel Macron called the election on 9 June. On the French election, Swiss investment bank UBS said there is uncertainty over what will happen in the second round because of 250+ “triangular votes”, with second rounds contested by three candidates. But the UBS analysts, led by Claudia Panseri, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management France, say that “the probability that no majority emerges from the election appears significant”. (And on that basis they tell investors to avoid overreaction in the coming days.) The reach of the French far right will depend in part on whether other parties work together to stop them, UBS said: By 6pm on 2 July, the candidates will need to confirm if they want to enter the second round or withdraw and lend their support to another candidate. It will also be important to see whether the various parties will give explicit guidance to their voters on which candidate to vote for in the second round in constituencies where their own candidate fared less well. Gabriel Attal, France’s prime minister, has called on members of his party who came in third to withdraw in favor of a “candidate who defends the values of the Republic”. For now, the left is calling on its third-placed candidates to withdraw in order to defeat the RN. But either way, a “period of political instability” is very likely, they write in a note to clients. France’s main stock index may have gained this morning, but UBS is cautious about the implications for company share prices, because uncertainty will be the name of the game for at least a week, and possibly longer. They wrote: The poor showing by Macron’s Ensemble alliance in the first round is likely to mean that French and Eurozone equities struggle to recover some of their recent losses. […] Fiscal worries will also likely remain until there is greater clarity after round two, preventing a larger rebound in stocks vulnerable to fiscal worries, such as financials and defense stocks. We expect European markets to stay volatile given there is still elevated uncertainty heading into the second round. UK mortgage approvals dipped slightly in May, but were right in line with expectations, according to new data from the Bank of England. Net mortgage approvals for house purchases fell from 60,800 in April to 60,000 in May, while approvals for remortgaging decreased slightly from 29,900 to 29,600 over the same period, the Bank said. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a German investment bank, said the French election result was “not worse than expected”. Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and its allies received 33% of the national popular vote, with the leftwing New Popular Front in second with 28%. President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist bloc was third on 20% of the vote. Schmieding said RN’s vote share was two points below opinion polling, meaning “a hung parliament remains the most likely outcome”. RN could still win an absolute majority in the second round on Sunday 7 July, but that “now looks even slightly less likely than it did before”, he wrote in a note to clients. He also noted that the possibility that the leftwing coalition could “take power and implement its costly agenda seems to have receded further”. (Investors have generally not been in favour of the potentially free-spending leftwing coalition.) Schmieding sketches out three scenarios (quoted here in full): Gridlock: The most likely outcome remains a hung parliament in which neither the far right nor the united left nor the Macron’s centrists can muster a majority. In this case, any (new) government would not get much done. Worse than gridlock: Although the united left and RN are polar opposites on issues of migration, culture and identity, they have all opposed Macron’s pro-growth reforms. As a result, we see a risk that Le Pen’s party and parts of the left may still join forces in a hung parliament on a few select issues to soften Macron’s pension reform and enhance the “purchasing power” of citizens, for instance through lower VAT on energy products or via additional subsidies. Marine Meloni: With a significantly lower probability than the first two scenarios, Le Pen’s party may still win a majority of seats and install RN boss Jordan Bardella as prime minister. If so, she would probably focus on winning the 2027 presidential election, staying on the more moderate track which she has signalled during the campaign. She may concentrate on some signature policies (e.g. being tough on immigration) rather than on expensive or disruptive fiscal promises. Put differently, Le Pen may try to largely follow the example of Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni. To do so, she may possibly explain to RN voters after a lengthy fiscal review that most of her original fiscal ideas could only be implemented slowly over time – or only if she became president in 2027. Schmieding sees “a change for the worse” after Macron’s “pro-growth economic reforms”. He thinks they will mean higher spending relative to government income, plus a much more combative relationship with the EU. Back on the French election fall-out, let’s look at what economists have had to say this morning. Marine Le Pen, leader of the victorious National Rally, formerly called for France to leave the euro currency and the EU. She has done her best to distance herself from any anti-euro sentiments in recent times, realising they are unpopular with people whose savings are in euros, but concerns over the future of Europe have been a major part of investor concerns over a far-right government. A hung parliament – as indicated by the first round of voting – would assuage some of those concerns. However, it could also stop Macron from making changes such as pension reforms that might boost economic growth, but which have proven unpopular with voters. Mohit Kumar, chief economist of Jefferies investment bank, said: The result is probably better-than-feared, but not as good as the status three weeks ago pre-elections. We could still be looking at the next few years of political paralysis in France with a stalling of the reform process. However, any fears of Frexit or a euro area breakup would be unfounded. Output from Europe’s manufacturing sector dropped in June as Germany’s economy continued to struggle, according to a closely followed index. That marked two years of contraction for the sector. The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the eurozone dropped from 47.3 points in May to 45.8 in June, according to S&amp;P Global. Germany’s enormous manufacturing sector is usually the powerhouse of Europe, but it has now been in contractionary territory for two years, according to the PMI reading. The latest Germany reading for June came in at 43.5, a marked drop from May’s 45.4 reading. That was marginally better than expectations, but remains well below the 50-point mark that denotes expansion. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: We are inclined to see this more as a temporary blip rather than a sign of a prolonged downturn. Manufacturing growth was seen in other parts of the world in June, such as the United States, UK, and India, according to their respective Flash PMI. This global recovery provides a supportive backdrop for Eurozone manufacturers. Additionally, optimism about future production remains as high as it was in May, indicating that businesses are still confident about the coming year. UK house prices rose by 1.5% in the year to June, a slight acceleration compared to 1.3% in the year to May, according to lender Nationwide. During June prices rose by 0.2% to an average of £266,604. The relatively slow pace of increases – certainly compared to the run of the last decade – is mostly down to higher interest rates, according to Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. He said: Housing market activity has been broadly flat over the last year, with the total number of transactions down by around 15% compared with 2019 levels. Transactions involving a mortgage are down even more (nearly 25%), reflecting the impact of higher borrowing costs. By contrast, the volume of cash transactions is actually around 5% above pre-pandemic levels. While earnings growth has been much stronger than house price growth in recent years, this hasn’t been enough to offset the impact of higher mortgage rates, which are still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic. The biggest price increases were in Northern Ireland, up 4.1% compared with the second quarter of 2023. Across England overall, prices were up 0.6% year-on-year, while Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% year-on-year rise. Prices fell 0.3% across southern England in the second quarter compared to a year earlier. Boeing has bought supplier Spirit Aerosystems for $4.7bn, reversing a move 19 years ago to spin out the fuselage manufacturer. The US planemaker is taking control of Spirit in response to a series of manufacturing issues – including a blown-out door panel in January – that have plunged it back into crisis mode just as it thought it was emerging from the shadow of two crashes of its bestselling 737 Max jet. It may not be listed in France, but Toulouse-headquartered Airbus is another big gainer on stock markets this morning. The Amsterdam-listed planemaker may be benefiting from the broader rally, but its shares are up 2.8% after it said it will gain $559m (£441m) in compensation. Airbus will take over manufacturer of fuselage sections for the A350 jet in Kinston, North Carolina, and St Nazaire, France, A220 pylons in Wichita, Kansas, and of the A220’s wings and mid-fuselage in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Casablanca, Morocco. Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun, who retires later this year, said: We believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly. By reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our safety and quality management systems, and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcomes – centered on safety and quality. French banks are leading the gains on the Cac 40 index in early trading, as investors predict a hung parliament following the first round of parliamentary elections. The share price of every company in the French benchmark index has risen so far today. Société Générale is the top gainer, up 6.4%, with Crédit Agricole and BNP Paribas both up 4.8%. French airports and construction company Vinci, which has a large number of government contracts, is up 4.9%. Energy utility Engie and waste and water company Veolia have risen 4.5% and 3.7% respectively. The FTSE 100 in London has also gained in the first few minutes of trading. It is up 0.6%. The biggest riser is property investment trust Landsec, up 3%, followed by energy company Centrica, up 2.4%. European stock markets are up across the board after the French election result. They are led by the Cac 40, France’s benchmark, which has surged by 2.6% at the opening bell. Spain’s Ibex is up 1.5%, Italy’s FTSE MIB is up 1.8% and the Europe-wide Euro Stoxx 600 index has gained 1%. Despite more expected signs of weak economic growth, even Germany’s Dax has edged up by 0.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. France’s far-right has won the first round of the country’s two-stage parliamentary elections, in a result that suggests it could be the largest party for the first time since the second world war. It is a seismic political result for Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, but financial markets have remained relatively steady as investors look to the prospect of a hung parliament. Analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid wrote: The first round of the French elections perhaps delivered a slightly less convincing victory for the far-right than final polls suggested and with other parties now seemingly open to form alliances in the second round, this is likely to further reduce the far-right’s chance of an overall majority in parliament. A hung parliament would make it very difficult for any single party to push through a legislative agenda – particularly given the main left- and rightwing parties’ cordon sanitaire against working with the far right. Here is a round-up of the different movements on Europe’s financial markets so far: The euro has gained against the US dollar. The single currency rose by 0.55% to $1.0771, after hitting its highest level in more than two weeks. The difference in yield between French and German bonds (AKA the spread) is generally seen as a key measure of risk appetite from investors. On the evidence of this morning, they are hopeful that a hung parliament could reduce any chance of a radical economic agenda in the next few years. The below chart shows how the spread has narrowed from 79 basis points (0.79 percentage points) to 73 basis points. That comes after the spread surge since 10 June, when markets responded to Macron’s shock decision to call a snap poll. Futures for the Cac 40 suggest France’s benchmark share index will surge by 3% when it opens at 8am BST. The index on Friday hit its lowest level since January.

        "title": "French market leaps amid hopes Le Pen will fall short of outright victory",
        "content": "Shares on the French stock market have risen after the first round of voting in the country’s parliamentary election eased concerns about an outright victory for the rightwing National Rally (RN) party. The euro rose against the dollar, while the risk premium investors demand for holding French government bonds fell as the markets took the view that the result could have been worse. But despite a 1.5% jump in France’s benchmark stock market measure – the Cac 40 – on Monday, shares have fallen 5% in the past month amid fears that Marine Le Pen’s RN could still emerge from next Sunday’s second round of voting with an overall majority. RN secured 33% of the vote, while the leftwing New Popular Front secured 28% and Emmanuel Macron’s centrist bloc won the support of 20% of those who voted. Alex Everett, an investment manager at the fund management company abrdn, said: “We are not out of the woods yet. The National Rally exceeded expectations and may yet pick up the second-round votes for a relative or even absolute majority. “Intense horse trading until Tuesday evening will likely see deals cut between the left and centre parties to try to derail this.” On Friday, the gap between the interest rate (yield) on French and German bonds had widened to its highest since the eurozone debt crisis in 2012, but the spread narrowed slightly from 0.85 percentage points to 0.75 points after the results came in. The gap was less than 0.5 points before the snap election was called. Krishna Guha, an analyst at the US investment bank Evercore, said: “The vote is far from definitive but leans in favour of the less bad scenario of a hung parliament, political paralysis in Paris and chronic dysfunction at the EU level rather than the worse scenarios of an outright win for the far right or far left that might directly lead to a new European sovereign crisis.” Guha warned that the fall in the stock market since Macron announced the election and the only partial narrowing of bond spreads underlined “that material risks remain heading into the second round vote Sunday and beyond”.",

        "title": "Harland & Wolff temporarily suspends trading as it delays accounts",
        "content": "The shipbuilder Harland &amp; Wolff has been forced to temporarily suspend trading in its shares after accounting issues meant it was unable to file audited accounts on time. The Aim-listed company, which owns the shipyard where the Titanic was built, said on Monday that it would suspend trading with immediate effect because accounts had not been filed. It expects to publish the accounts in the week commencing 8 July, with share trading resuming at that point. The Belfast-based shipbuilder was plunged into uncertainty last month when it was reported that the UK government was witholding the approval of a £200m loan guarantee promised in December to shore up its finances. The update on Monday said that because of the “multi-year and complex nature” of some of its contracts, it had been in “extensive discussions” with auditors over how best to record revenues over the duration of a build programme. It said that this was particularly relevant when assessing incomes from its seven-year contract with the Spanish shipbuilder Navantia to assist in the construction of fleet support ships for the Royal Navy, a deal that is expected to net the UK company £750m. It added: “The assessment of the split in revenues between current year’s revenues and deferred revenues has caused a delay to the audit process and hence the publication of the company’s annual report and audited financial statements.” The company was able to publish unaudited accounts in which it posted an operating loss of £24.7m for the 12 months until 31 December 2023, an improvement on a £58.5m loss a year earlier. Revenues increased from £27.8m in 2022, to £86.9m this year. In May, the GMB union wrote to the chancellor warning that any decision to block the £200m loan guarantee that had been offered to Harland &amp; Wolff would put jobs at threat. The letter was prompted by reports that the government was looking to withdraw support for a £200m loan facility Harland &amp; Wolff had applied for through UK Export Finance. The money would allow it to borrow to pay off expensive debts owed to Riverstone Credit Partners, a US investor. In the update, the company said further work was continuing on the facility and it expected that a decision would be made after Thursday’s general election. It added: “Should there be any material delays to securing the facility post the general election, the company’s ability to execute new and large contracts would be adversely affected.” Harland &amp; Wolff also owns ports across England and Scotland, including Methil on the Firth of Forth, Appledore in North Devon and Arnish Point on the Isle of Lewis.",

        "title": "Boeing to buy supplier Spirit AeroSystems in $4.7bn deal",
        "content": "Boeing has agreed a $4.7bn (£3.7bn) deal to buy the parts supplier it sold nearly 20 years ago, as it seeks to improve safety on its production lines after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines-operated plane mid-flight earlier this year. The under-pressure US planemaker will buy Spirit AeroSystems, which supplies it with fuselage and wing parts, as it attempts to improve safety and quality in its manufacturing processes. Talks to buy back Spirit began just weeks after a door panel blew out in mid-air on one of Boeing’s 737 Max 9s in January, shortly after it took off from Portland, Oregon. Investigations by the US safety regulator later discovered the panel appeared to be missing four key bolts. The National Transportation Safety Board said the four bolts were removed while workers repaired damaged rivets last year at Boeing’s facility in Renton, Washington. The deal to bring Spirit back in house marks a shift away from Boeing outsourcing key components for its planes. Spirit was spun off from Boeing in 2005 but it still accounts for about 70% of all of its orders, with roughly 25% coming from Airbus – Boeing’s arch-rival. The Boeing president and chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said: “By reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our safety and quality management systems, and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcomes – centred on safety and quality.” Airbus will take over the part of Spirit’s business in Northern Ireland that makes wings and fuselage for its A220 jet. Spirit is one of Northern Ireland’s largest manufacturing employers, with about 3,500 staff across the country. About 40% of Spirit jobs in Northern Ireland are linked to production for companies including Bombardier and Rolls-Royce, and Airbus has said it will aim to sell some of these parts, creating uncertainty. Northern Ireland’s economy minister, Conor Murphy, said: “I have been engaging with the company and union on the acquisition and will work with all key stakeholders to ensure that the future status of the highly skilled workforce is protected.” Boeing will pay Airbus $559m in compensation to take over operations at four of its plants, including the plant in Belfast. The total transaction value is about $8.3bn when Spirit’s net debt is included, Boeing said. Spirit shareholders will receive $37.50 a share as part of the deal. It was revealed on Sunday that the US Department of Justice is poised to charge Boeing with fraud. However, plans to offer the planemaker a plea deal – according to sources familiar with the matter – have infuriated the loved ones of hundreds of passengers who died in two fatal crashes five years ago. Boeing will be granted until the end of this week to decide whether it will plead guilty to the charge and avoid trial, officials told families of those onboard the fatal Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, which claimed 346 lives. Attorneys representing the relatives accused the federal government of cooking up “another sweetheart plea deal” with Boeing.",

        "title": "London investment bankers to rake in bigger bonuses after two-year slump",
        "content": "London’s investment bankers are expected to rake in bigger bonuses this financial year, as the City begins to recover from a two-year slump in deals caused by surging interest rates. Demand for investment banking services – such as facilitating mergers and acquisitions, advising companies and governments on fundraising, and underwriting new stock and bonds – was hit by a sharp increase in borrowing rates after the pandemic, as central banks acted to tame runaway inflation. Jobs and pay were cut as investment banks sought to reduce costs. But the rate hike cycle has ended, with the UK and US expected to begin reducing the cost of borrowing before Christmas. Forecasters say the recent increase in dealmaking is likely to be felt during the spring bonus season. “The outlook for 2024 is brightening after a promising first quarter and there are signs of capital markets activity thawing after a two-year freeze,” Dartmouth Partners, a recruiter for banks, consulting firms and startups, said in its annual compensation survey covering London investment bankers. That is likely to mean bigger bonuses for investment bankers at the London offices of “bulge bracket” firms including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank, rewarding those who managed to keep their jobs and wait out nearly two years of falling payouts. “It feels like there’s more of a an upswing happening,” the Dartmouth Partners founder, Logan Naidu, told the Guardian. “Even if the revenue is not quite there, the activity is and I would suspect that compensation would go up on last year. Will it be back up to where it was in 2021-22? I doubt it is going to be that good. But I think it will be better than than last year.” Naidu said the UK’s decision to scrap the banker bonus cap, which previously limited bonuses to 100% of salaries, would probably mean that salary rises could be replaced with larger bonuses over the long term. “What might happen is base pay starts to get a bit more suppressed, and variable comp starts to become a larger part of the narrative again, which is probably good news for the banks in terms of how they manage their cost base.” There is still time for most investment bankers to build their bonus pots. While junior analysts will be paid out at the end of the summer, bonus decisions for higher-level staff will be made at the end of the year. Dartmouth Partners released data showing average pay tumbled last year across most investment banking positions at eight of the major investment banks, ranging from junior-level analysts to more senior associates and vice-president roles. While lower-paid analysts took home bonuses worth an average of £44,267 in 2023 – marking a near 50% increase compared with a year earlier – mid-tier associates’ bonus payouts fell by nearly a fifth to £80,065 on average, sending their total pay down 8.3% to £213,940. Meanwhile, some vice-presidents had their bonuses slashed by 22% to £135,183, reducing total average pay by 11.8% to £303,204. The survey, which interviewed more than 250 London-based bankers – working at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America – found that a number of bankers working at European firms were hoping to jump ship to their American rivals, which tend to offer higher overall compensation. But even Goldman Sachs cut pay for its vice-presidents by 7.6% on average, while its associates were hit by an 8.3% drop. JP Morgan vice-presidents experienced a 7% cut and associate pay fell by 4.6%. London-based vice-presidents at Morgan Stanley were hit by the largest drop in total pay on average last year, with it falling nearly by 26.8%, followed by Bank of America where vice-president-level pay fell 23.5%. Global banks collectively cut more than than 600,000 jobs in 2023, making it one of the biggest years for redundancies since the 2007-08 financial crisis. “Even though bonuses have been poor, many bankers said they are happy to still have a job,” the survey said. Change in average compensation for vice-presidents, from 2022 to 2023 Bank of America: -23.5% Barclays: -15.9% Citi: -2% Deutsche Bank: -16.8% Goldman Sachs: -7.6% JP Morgan: -7% Morgan Stanley: -26.8% UBS: -11.9%",

        "title": "US accused of offering Boeing ‘sweetheart deal’ over fatal crashes",
        "content": "The US Department of Justice is set to charge Boeing with fraud, but plans to offer the plane maker a plea deal, according to sources familiar with the matter – have infuriated the loved ones of hundreds of passengers who died in two fatal crashes five years ago. Boeing will be granted until the end of this week to decide whether it will plead guilty to the charge and avoid trial, officials told families of those on board the fatal Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 that claimed 346 lives. Attorneys representing the relatives accused the federal government of cooking up “another sweetheart plea deal” with Boeing. On a conference call on Sunday, one official is said to have been asked by a family member how he sleeps at night. Relatives were briefed on the terms of the proposed deal during the call: Boeing would pay a fine, face a three-year term of probation, and work under a corporate monitor, according to two sources. The terms unleashed a wave of anger. “The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,” said Paul Cassell, who represents the families of 15 crash victims. Erin Applebaum, another attorney acting for relatives of those lost, attacked the proposal as “shameful” and said it “completely fails to mention or recognize the dignity” of the victims. The families will make the case to a judge, and the wider public, for this deal to be rejected, Applebaum said. “And when there is inevitably another Boeing crash and DoJ seeks to assign blame, they will have nowhere else to look but in the mirror.” The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The two crashes of Boeing’s 737 Max, in October 2018 and March 2019, killed 346 people. It prompted the worldwide grounding of the jet for almost two years. In 2021, the justice department and Boeing reached a controversial deal that protected the company from a criminal conspiracy charge to commit fraud that arose from the two crashes. Earlier this year, however – as the company came under intense scrutiny after a brand-new 737 Max jet was forced into an emergency landing when a cabin panel blew off mid-flight – the justice department said Boeing had breached this agreement. The deal it has been offered “appears to be a sweetheart deal”, said Sanjiv Singh, counsel for 16 families of crash victims, citing a request for the Department of Justice to independently appoint a corporate monitor of Boeing, rather that permit the company to nominate its own candidates. “I am stunned that the department deflected our demand and fell back on ‘oh it’s policy’,” he said. Relatives of those who died “will strenuously object to this plea deal”, said Cassell, who described the agreement as a “no-accountability deal”. “The deal will not acknowledge, in any way, that Boeing’s crime killed 346 people,” Cassell said. “It also appears to rest on the idea that Boeing did not harm any victim.” Separately, as Boeing continues to grapple with the crisis triggered by January’s cabin blowout, Reuters reported on Sunday that it had agreed to buy Spirit AeroSystems – a key supplier – in a deal which values the firm at more than $4bn.",

        "title": "Soaring government debt could roil global financial markets, warns BIS head",
        "content": "Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France’s high-stakes parliamentary elections. Agustín Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the world economy was on course for a “smooth landing” from the inflation crisis, but he warned that policymakers, especially politicians, needed to be careful. Global government debt is already at record levels and elections ranging from the US presidential vote in November, to recent polls in Mexico and South Africa, and votes in France and Britain in the coming week, all carry risks. Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call a snap election in France has sent the country’s bank stocks crashing and alarmed the bond markets, exacerbating fiscal sustainability concerns in the eurozone’s second-largest economy. Polls released before the first round of voting on Sunday suggested the far right could win the largest share of the vote, amid record turnout. Carstens said the BIS was not calling out any “one or two” governments but that the message was clear. “They [governments] must cut short the rise in public debt and accept that interest rates may not return to the pre-pandemic ultra-low levels,” he said. “We need a solid foundation to build upon.” With interest rates not about to go back to ultra-low levels, and cost pressures from ageing populations, climate breakdown and rebuilding defence capabilities, economic stimulus plans and a general rise in protectionism could unsettle sensitive markets, BIS warned as it published its annual report. “They can surprise you with not much notice,” Carstens told reporters, pointing to the turbulence in Britain’s markets after then prime minister Liz Truss’s budget plans, which put some pension funds at risk of collapse. “You really want to avoid that.” France’s main parties have all promised new spending. Macron’s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 – an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July. If it forms a government, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost €7bn (£5.9bn) for the rest of this year and €12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget. The left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%. The turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany’s rising to its highest level since 2012. France’s blue-chip CAC 40 index is down 6% since Macron dissolved parliament, with French banks having been among the biggest losers. The big three – Société Générale, BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole – are down 10%-14% since Macron’s announcement. French banks have a large amount of debt and are expected to suffer if credit costs increase sharply. The positive for Carstens was that central banks have successfully reined in inflation, which had hit decades-long highs after the Covid-19 pandemic, and then Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets. “Compared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,” the former Mexican central bank governor said. Although Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added that they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness. He described an “extreme” scenario where inflation raced up again and central banks needed to raise rates further. But that is not what the BIS expects.",

        "title": "Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as furnaces face closure",
        "content": "The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has written to trade unions offering fresh talks amid a battle to delay plans to cut 2,800 jobs and suspend production at a site that has been in operation since 1951. The Guardian understands that a letter sent on Sunday afternoon by Rajesh Nair, the UK boss of Tata Steel, has offered a new round of discussions about future investments at the company’s plants in the UK, including Port Talbot. However, sources have said the offer to the National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee, which represents all three unions at the site in south Wales, is predicated on unions agreeing to suspend any future industrial action. Tata had originally planned to close the second of its two remaining blast furnaces at the end of September, while the process of shutting down the first is due to begin in the middle of this week. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking, bringing to a halt more than 70 years of steelmaking in Port Talbot. The plans were brought forward after the Unite union announced indefinite strike action beginning on 8 July. Tata said it could not “safely and stably” operate the plant during any strike, and it has brought forward complete closure of the second furnace to as early as next Sunday 7 July. The new electric furnace is not due to come onstream until 2027 and unions want steelmaking to continue until then. The Guardian understands the talks being offered would focus on future investments. Commenting on the letter, Alun Davies, national officer for Community, the steelworkers’ union, said there were no fresh talks being proposed, and it simply reaffirmed Tata’s position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting in May. He said: “This position is that all unions will seek to conclude the negotiations on a memorandum of understanding and then put this to their members to decide whether it’s good enough.” He added that the letter from Tata confirmed that all discussions would take place through the UK Steel Committee, which is chaired by Community’s general secretary, Roy Rickhuss. Unite warned over the weekend that any closure would be “irreversible” and urged Tata not to “abandon” the workers employed at the plant. It said: “We again call on the company to wait until we have a change of government, not make any irreversible decisions, and enter into meaningful negotiations.” The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, was reportedly in talks with the unions and Tata last week in an effort to avert the early closure. The first minister of Wales, Vaughan Gething, and the Welsh economy secretary, Jeremy Miles, said: “The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces 4 and 5 at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. “The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.” Earlier this year, Tata struck a controversial deal with the UK government, securing a £500m grant to build a greener £1.25bn electric arc furnace. However, the company wants to mothball Port Talbot during construction, leaving thousands of local people without work in a town where Tata is the main employer. The Labour party, widely expected to win a majority in Thursday’s general election, has previously promised to invest £3bn in the UK’s steel industry in the next parliament, if elected. This would include the £500m already pledged to Port Talbot. Last month Unite announced that its 1,500 Tata members would commence “all-out indefinite strike action” from 8 July, vowing to continue the strikes until Tata stopped its “disastrous” plan. The Community and GMB unions, which also represent staff at Port Talbot, have said they will wait until after the election before deciding whether to strike. Unite insisted on Saturday it would keep enough staff on site during the strike to ensure all safety procedures would be met, which would ensure the furnaces could function until September. Tata has also now launched a legal challenge against Unite to try to avert its planned strike action, with a decision on whether it has been successful expected on Wednesday. If that is the case, Tata could revert to its plan of closing the second furnace in September. Unite has hit back at the legal action, saying: “Instead of waiting for a likely change of government, Tata has decided to double down, making continued threats and hiring City lawyers to try to stop industrial action on trumped-up technicalities. If they are successful, Unite will reballot. We cannot allow these steel jobs to go.” Tata has previously said it is losing about £1m each day keeping the remaining furnaces open. A Tata spokesperson said: “In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations (including both blast furnaces) on the Port Talbot site. “That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.”",

        "title": "What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?",
        "content": "Is the country heading towards a recession? Ask 10 economists and you’ll likely get 10 different answers. Which is why some people have given up on the traditional data – GDP, jobs, etc – and have instead recently been tinkering with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here are a few that I’ve seen. Uniform patches One known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there’s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world’s largest makers of emblems and patches – privately held World Emblem – can’t be easily obtained. But the company’s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? “We’re not seeing it,” says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. “It’s hard to believe there would be.” Men’s underwear Ask any guy about underwear, and they’ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we’re buying the good material. When money’s tight, we’re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some – including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan – think so. If you want to check out how the men’s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. “Bottom” line: men’s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months. Lipstick For the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don’t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that’s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L’Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year. Overseas freight World shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They’re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times. Recreational vehicles If you’ve never taken a trip in a recreational vehicle (RV), you’re missing out. It’s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs – a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how’s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America’s largest makers of these vehicles – Winnebago – not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company’s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year. I’m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men’s underwear you can also track women’s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it. Goofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn’t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I’ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I’ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick.",

        "title": "Better economic news will not stop Tories from suffering their biggest ever defeat | Larry Elliott",
        "content": "Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude. Assuming the polls are right – and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign – the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result. But in 1906, Arthur Balfour’s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories. News on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that’s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased. Living standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income – a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account – rose by 2.4% over the past year. That’s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don’t remain popular when voters are getting poorer. Only twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war. In the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it. As it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis. Other recent developments – especially those overseas – are not so welcome. Joe Biden’s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt. Meanwhile, the first round of voting in France’s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen’s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government. Events in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power. Most obviously, the world has become a less safe place. The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending. Globalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures – not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country. What’s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats. The developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance. So those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation – the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis – when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years. And an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.",

        "title": "The baby bust: how Britain’s falling birthrate is creating alarm in the economy",
        "content": "Having children has become an unaffordable luxury for many of her generation, says Vanessa, a 35-year-old project manager living in Brighton. “My friends who managed to start a family, without exception, all received large sums of money from their parents to get on the property ladder. For those of us not fortunate enough, we are trapped in the rental market, largely with insecure, poorly paid employment.” Vanessa’s outlook is also clouded by concerns about the climate crisis, crumbling public services and the “plummeting mental health of young people”, she says. “Put these into the mix and you have a perfect storm for declining birthrates.” Her decision is replicated worldwide. The number of women of child-bearing age is in long-term decline across Europe, parts of Asia, South America and the US, a situation made worse by the steep drop in the number of women, and their partners, who either want or are able to have children. These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman. While the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world. Today, almost every continent has a growing age-dependency ratio as average birthrates fall and people live longer. If the global population hits 10.4 billion in the 2080s as predicted, it will only be because sub-Saharan Africa has continued on its current trend, pushing the population across the African continent from about 1.5 billion to as many as 2.5 billion. Here we look at the trends, and the implications for future governments, of a demographic revolution. How the UK is affected The total fertility rate across England and Wales fell to 1.49 children per woman in 2022, from 1.55 in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). As a benchmark, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that to maintain a population, the “replacement rate”, often known as the “R-rate”, needs to be at least 2.1 children per woman. It has been well documented that the pandemic, rather than spark a baby boom, had the reverse effect. Yet the recent drop in fertility has shocked demographers. The rate was already declining, starting in 2010: then came Covid-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a deepening of the climate crisis, which all appeared to add a further downward shift, taking the fertility rate to the lowest since comparative data began being kept in the 1930s. Ann Berrington, a professor of demography and social statistics at Southampton University, says: “The Human Fertility Database covering England and Wales documents the 1960s baby boom, 1970s baby bust, the fluctuations of the 1980s and 1990s that kept things fairly stable, increases through 2000s to 2010, and then a decline to the historical low levels seen today.” The trend in Scotland follows the same pattern, but on a lower trajectory during each period over the last 60 years. Northern Ireland follows the same pattern on a slightly elevated path. ONS figures tracking live births tell the same story of decline. They show 605,479 in England and Wales in 2022, a 3.1% fall from 2021 and the lowest number since 2002. This figure is not an all-time low because the UK’s population has been expanding since 2003, when the UK embraced the free movement of people from countries that had recently joined the EU. Opening its doors to workers from eastern Europe resulted in an increase in total births, and maintained fertility rates, which were about the same for UK-born and foreign-born women at the time. But when record numbers of women are reaching the age of 30 child-free, the effect has clearly waned. According to the latest data, half of women born in 1990 were childless by their 30th birthday – the first generation for which that is true. It’s the economy … When the Observer asked readers, including Vanessa, to say why they had not had children, or had restricted the size of their family, most replied that financial constraints were the main reason. Hannah, a 35-year-old marketing executive living in London, says she had been unable to have the two children she wanted with her partner of 10 years, despite moving to a cheaper area to secure a bigger home. Childcare costs were prohibitively high, along with other costs of living, she says. “The family we want to have is financially out of reach. We have only ever had one holiday together since our relationship began. We are cutting down on food bills and looking for extra work to make having a child happen.” She and her partner are considering moving abroad. In the early 00s, Britain and France were outliers in Europe. Both countries had generous family benefits and governments with a stated aim of supporting children. The scale of generosity, from tax credits for low earners to an expansion of early years centres and childcare subsidies, meant both countries – under Labour in the UK and the Gaullist centre-right in France – arrested declines over previous decades. In the UK and France, these subsidies were scaled back after the recessions of 2008-09. Austerity across all public services was the message from Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president from 2007 to 2012, and from the UK ’s coalition government from 2010 to 2015. For all the impact of welfare and public service cuts, a study by Fathom Consulting indicates those interested in creating a family look further ahead. In the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, it was clear the future for many households looked bleak, with incomes flat and costs, especially housing, on a steady incline. Without the optimism of previous generations, couples decided not to have children, according to the initial findings from a study of Japan that links declines in fertility with periods when the future outlook for the economy was uncertain. “It turns out that there is a good relationship between forecasts of 15-year forward growth in Japan at any point in time and the fertility rate in Japan at the same point in time,” says the report. “In other words, people have kids when they feel optimistic that, when their kids join the workforce, the standard of living they will enjoy will be better than it is now.” To measure growth, the report used national income per capita, which has improved in Japan while the overall economy has stagnated. Japan’s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy’s 1.2 and South Korea’s 0.8. The consultancy’s director, Erik Britton, says the research is ongoing and the conclusions only tentative, but the initial findings reveal that government support, while a necessary element, might not be the most important factor. A nation confidently growing its economy is the comfort people need before starting a family, he says. … but also other factors Recent data from the UK Generations and Gender Survey tells us that the ideal family size remains relatively high, with an average of about two children. There remains evidence of a two-child family ideal. Berrington says that when her team asked childless people whether they intend to have children, there was “a lot of uncertainty in the answers”. Higher proportions of young adults said they probably or definitely would not have children, as compared with the proportions reported by millennials at a similar age. Fiona Powley, 49, a life coach, knew she did not want children by the age of 12, and knows many contemporaries who also prefer to be child-free; she runs the group Bristol Childfree Women. As an indication of the problem faced by any government seeking to boost fertility, she says that when she asks people as they join her community what they enjoy most about being child-free, “they talk about time and freedom: finances don’t usually feature”. She adds: “A common judgment from others asks ‘who will look after you when you’re old?’, to which most members might say they’ve made good financial provision for older-age care and pensions as they’ve not have the financial strain of children.” Sarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, says one of the main issues is equality, meaning equal treatment by the state and within a relationship. It is only when women believe they can continue working and have spare time that they will take the plunge into motherhood, she says – though the evidence from the Nordic countries, where fertility rates have followed the general downward trend, is weak. However, it might explain why traditional South Korea’s fertility rate is so low. “These days women say they have no obligation to reproduce and ‘I’m not going to have a baby who turns my life upside down’,” says Harper, who advised the David Cameron’s government on the implications of an ageing society. Public services The Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says falling birthrates are going to have a negative effect on tax receipts. That is a situation that is not necessarily solved by higher immigration. In a recent report, it said that while every additional migrant generally boosts the level of output in the economy, “the size of this impact and the effect on per-person living standards is highly uncertain. “The age, education, skill level, and participation rate of migrants, alongside the investment response of businesses, are all factors that determine the impact of migration on per-person output,” it said. At the moment, the UK population is increasing – by an estimated 6.6 million to 73.7 million over the next 15 years – but the economy is on course to grow at a slower pace, meaning there is less of the financial pie to go around. Without a healthy rise in tax receipts, governments will struggle to pay for vital services. Schools are in the frontline of cuts as pupil numbers decline, according to the Resolution Foundation. In England, they could lose up to £1bn in funding by 2030, with exceptional falls in pupil numbers prompting closures as some establishments cease to be financially viable. Councils across the country have begun to consult local residents about mergers and closures to make the system viable. According to the Education Policy Institute (EPI), a thinktank, the north-east is projected to see the greatest decline in primary pupil numbers, down 13% by 2028-29. Primary school teachers could face redundancy, such is the dramatic loss of young children, says Lindsey Macmillan, an education policy expert at University College London. She says secondary schools that are now suffering teacher shortages will see the gap close as classes are cut and schools merged. Pupil numbers had grown because of a fertility surge in the 00s, but that cohort has moved through primary and on to secondaries, leaving empty seats in their wake. Looking ahead, even with real terms increases in per-pupil funding over the remainder of the decade, the EPI predicts that many schools will suffer funding cuts due to fewer pupils causing income to fall, though costs will remain high. What about ageing? Plenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer. Will robots be able to look after elderly people? Could a new social contract between young and old give millennials and gen Z the security and encouragement they need to have more children? And can the UK import all the missing labour it needs, such as from sub-Saharan Africa, where births are expected to be higher? Nik Lomax, a professor of population geography at Leeds University, says one problem faced by the next government will be how different regions are affected. “One way of thinking about the implications of this is to assess the old-age dependency ratio – the number of people of retirement age for every 1,000 people of working age,” he says. “This reveals striking differences by geography, and will get larger over time as the number of old people relative to working age people increases.” Just as fertility rates are falling fastest in the north-east, Wales, the south-west and parts of the Midlands, the dependency ratio is increasing in these regions too. Harper says a clear trend shows fewer people entering the workforce and older people living longer, and not necessarily in good health. “Men in areas that rank in the lowest third by average incomes will live until they are 80, but spend their 70s in ill health,” she says. “Men who live in the top third of affluent areas will live until their late 80s and won’t be ill or have a disability, on average, until they are 80.” Harper says the Cameron government put ageing into its industrial strategy and considered many of the implications of falling birthrates and rising levels of ill health among a growing number of over-65s. But the industrial strategy and policy initiatives were later jettisoned. Given that we are not going to change the dynamics of fertility rates and have women go back to producing three to four children, we need to extend people’s lives in a healthy way, Harper says. Berrington says the implications for policymaking are “very significant – for example, the short-term decline in demand for childcare, maternity services and other parts of the economy that depend on people buying goods and services for children. “Policy responses to low fertility have tended to focus on ways to increase fertility,” she says. “However, many pronatalist policies do not work, especially cash benefits, as they tend to just bring forward in time births that would happen anyway, and not increase the overall number of births.” Pronatalist policies – those that attempt to boost the birthrate – are also often problematic in terms of entrenching gender inequality and reducing reproductive freedom. A report by the Social Market Foundation thinktank in 2021 said the tens of billions of pounds it would take to support an expansion of family welfare could be better spent. “We do not recommend that the government pursues a distinct ‘population strategy’ to increase the birthrate. However, the government should convene a cross-departmental working group to examine how different policies affect the birthrate,” it said. Berrington says healthy ageing is crucial to the prospects for the economy, providing more workers and helping fill the state’s coffers. “And governments will need to look to other policy solutions, such as increasing employment among groups which for different reasons – poor mental wellbeing, or because they have young children – have relatively high inactivity rates.”",

        "content": "To the stirring strains of the Marseillaise, a monochrome Angela Rayner reels off her plans for workers’ rights, as a red beret and a Gallic moustache jiggle around her head. “Angela Rayner’s Britain?” demands the title, alongside a tiny tricolour. Tory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday’s example, warning that Labour may make the UK’s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness. For one thing, the mention of France seems more likely to evoke pleasant holidays than picket lines. More importantly, polling suggests the policies Rayner set out in the clip – employment rights from day one of a job, banning fire and rehire, binning bogus self-employment – are popular with the public. Recent TUC polling found that two-thirds of people supported employees having the right to unfair dismissal from day one – including 61% of 2019 Tory voters. Similarly, two-thirds were in favour of a ban on fire and rehire. Two things probably underlie the groundswell of opinion that tougher rules are needed in the labour market. One is the plain fact that too many people have found themselves working hard and still unable to make ends meet. Real wage growth has been all but stagnant for the best part of 15 years, with average earnings a pathetic £16 a week higher than in 2010 – despite significant increases in the minimum wage (rebranded as the “national living wage”) under successive Conservative governments. Against that backdrop, it is hardly surprising some feel the balance has tipped too far from workers to employers – a sentiment that perhaps also partly explains the support for public sector strikes last year. It is more than that, however: there is a sense not just of a lack of bargaining power, but of unfairness, injustice even, in the way the labour market works for those trapped at the bottom. From “self-employed” gig economy workers summarily laid off via an app to social care staff exploited by rogue employers and shift workers unable to plan childcare because of last-minute changes, there is an infuriating impotence about so many people’s interactions with the labour market. That is only likely to increase as new technologies are used to monitor and even manage workers as they go about their jobs. In theory, Labour’s new deal for working people should help to turn the tide, particularly when combined with the tougher approach to enforcement Rayner has promised. Social care is set to be the testing ground for a new approach of “fair pay agreements” under which employers and unions will have to hammer out terms and conditions that ministers will then apply across the sector. Unions will be given the right to enter workplaces and make the case for membership – something the GMB has only just won at Amazon’s Coventry warehouse under strict conditions as part of a statutory ballot. And a new Labour government would consult about establishing a single employment status, abolishing the halfway house of “worker”, which comes with more obligations than rights. As with so many areas of Labour’s agenda, however, the details will be critical – as will timing. Fair pay agreements were introduced in New Zealand in 2022, but implementation took so long that not a single one had come into force before the government changed and the plan was scrapped. When, as seems likely, Rayner arrives at her desk as deputy prime minister on Friday, she will face intense pressure to water down the plans from business groups – and from some in her own party. The Tory attack video echoed a line that originated with the CBI’s president, Rupert Soames, that Labour is poised to create a “European model” for the labour market. It is worth stressing how far away the UK is from that at present: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data suggests that 26% of workers here are covered by collective bargaining, for example, compared with 100% in Italy, 98% in France and 54% in Germany. But Soames’s concerns will find an echo among some in Labour. Furious unions confronted the party earlier this year over what they saw as an effort to undermine the new deal for workers – with union insiders claiming the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was keen to burnish her business credentials by being seen to push back against the plans. A fragile peace broke out after a face-to-face meeting between union general secretaries and shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer, but much about the fine details will only become clear the other side of the election. The necessity to regain business backing has been a key part of Labour’s plan to win Thursday’s vote. If it succeeds, as polls suggest, the question facing the party on Friday will be a very different one: how to wield that power? Regulation of the labour market is knotty, unglamorous and the subject of intense lobbying, but it has the potential to change millions of people’s lives for the better. Rayner should embrace the beret, face down the doubters and be bold.",

        "content": "If you want evidence of Microsoft’s progress towards its environmental “moonshot” goal, then look closer to earth: at a building site on a west London industrial estate. The company’s Park Royal datacentre is part of its commitment to drive the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI), but that ambition is jarring with its target of being carbon negative by 2030. Microsoft says the centre will be run fully on renewable energy. However, the construction of datacentres and the servers they are filled with means that the company’s scope 3 emissions – such as CO2 related to the materials in its buildings and the electricity people consume when using products such as Xbox – are more than 30% above their 2020 level. As a result, the company is exceeding its overall emissions target by roughly the same rate. This week, Microsoft’s co-founder, Bill Gates, claimed AI would help combat climate change because big tech is “seriously willing” to pay extra to use clean electricity sources in order “to say that they’re using green energy”. In the short term, AI has been problematic for Microsoft’s green goals. Brad Smith, Microsoft’s outspoken president, once called its carbon ambitions a “moonshot”. In May, stretching that metaphor to breaking point, he admitted that because of its AI strategy, “the moon has moved”. It plans to spend £2.5bn over the next three years on growing its AI datacentre infrastructure in the UK and this year has announced new datacentre projects around the world including in the US, Japan, Spain and Germany. Training and operating the AI models that underpin products such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini uses a lot of electricity to power and cool the associated hardware, with additional carbon generated by making and transporting the related equipment. “It is a technology that is driving up energy consumption,” says Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a website monitoring the environmental impact of new technologies. The International Energy Agency estimates that datacentres’ total electricity consumption could double from 2022 levels to 1,000 TWh (terawatt hours) in 2026, equivalent to the energy demand of Japan. AI will result in datacentres using 4.5% of global energy generation by 2030, according to calculations by research firm SemiAnalysis. It means that amid the concerns about AI’s impact on jobs and humanity’s longevity, the environment is featuring, too. Last week, the International Monetary Fund said governments should consider imposing carbon taxes to capture the environmental cost of AI, in the form of a general carbon levy that captures emissions from servers as part of its reach, or other methods such as a specific tax on CO2 generated by that equipment. All the big tech firms involved in AI – Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft – are seeking renewable energy resources to meet their climate targets. In January, Amazon, the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, announced it had bought more than half the output of an offshore windfarm in Scotland, while Microsoft said in May it was backing $10bn (£7.9bn) in renewable energy projects. Google aims to run its datacentres entirely on carbon-free energy by 2030. A spokesperson for Microsoft said: “We remain resolute in our commitment to meet our climate goals.” Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who left in 2020 but retains a stake in the company via the Gates Foundation Trust, has argued that AI can directly help fight climate change. The extra electricity demand would be matched by new investments in green generation, he said on Thursday, which would more than compensate for the use. A recent UK government-backed report agreed, stating that the “carbon intensity of the energy source is a key variable” in calculating AI-related emissions, although it adds that “a significant portion of AI training globally still relies on high-carbon sources such as coal or natural gas”. The water needed to cool servers is also an issue, with one study estimating that AI could account for up to 6.6bn cubic meters of water use by 2027 – nearly two-thirds of England’s annual consumption. De Vries argues that the chase for sustainable computing power puts a strain on demand for renewable energy, which would result in fossil fuels picking up the slack in other sections of the global economy. “More energy consumption means we don’t have enough renewables to feed that increase,” he says. NexGen Cloud, a UK firm that provides sustainable cloud computing, a datacentre-reliant industry that delivers IT services such as data storage and computing power over the internet, says renewable energy sources for AI-related computing are available for datacentres if they avoid cities and are sited next to sources of hydro or geothermal power. Youlian Tzanev, NexGen Cloud’s co-founder, says: “The industry norm has been to build around economic hubs rather than sources of renewable energy.” This makes it more difficult for any AI-focused tech company to hit carbon goals. Amazon, the world’s biggest cloud computing provider, aims to be net zero – removing as much carbon as it emits – by 2040 and to match its global electricity use with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Google and Meta are pursuing the same net zero goal by 2030. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, uses Microsoft datacentres to train and operate its products. There are two key ways in which large language models – the technology that underpins chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini – consume energy. The first is the training phase, where a model is fed reams of data culled from the internet and beyond, and builds a statistical understanding of language itself, which ultimately enables it to churn out convincing-looking answers to queries. The upfront energy cost of training AI is astronomical. That keeps smaller companies (and even smaller governments) from competing in the sector, if they do not have a spare $100m to throw at a training run. But it is dwarfed by the cost of actually running the resulting models, a process known as “inference”. According to analyst Brent Thill, at the investment firm Jefferies, 90% of the energy cost of AI sits in that inference phase: the electricity used when people ask an AI system to respond to factual queries, summarise a chunk of text or write an academic essay. The electricity used for training and inference is funnelled through an enormous and growing digital infrastructure. The datacentres are filled with servers, which are built from the ground up for the specific part of the AI workload they sit in. A single training server may have a central processing unit (CPU) barely more powerful than the one in your own computer, paired with tens of specialised graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) – microchips designed to rapidly plough through the vast quantities of simple calculations that AI models are made of. If you use a chatbot, as you watch it spit out answers word by word, a powerful GPU is using about a quarter of the power required to boil a kettle. All of this is being hosted by a datacentre, whether owned by the AI provider itself or a third party – in which case it might be called “the cloud”, a fancy name for someone else’s computer. SemiAnalysis estimates that if generative AI was integrated into every Google search this could translate into annual energy consumption of 29.2 TWh, comparable with what Ireland consumes in a year, although the financial cost to the tech company would be prohibitive. That has led to speculation that the search company may start charging for some AI tools. But some argue that looking at the energy overhead for AI is the wrong lens. Instead, consider the energy the new tools can save. A provocative paper in Nature’s peer-reviewed Scientific Reports journal earlier this year argued that the carbon emissions of writing and illustrating are lower for AI than for humans. AI systems emit “between 130 and 1,500 times” less carbon dioxide a page of text generated compared with human writers, the researchers from University of California Irvine estimated, and up to 2,900 times less an image. Left unsaid, of course, is what those human writers and illustrators are doing instead. Redirecting and retraining their labour in another field – such as green jobs – could be another moonshot.",

        "title": "Will rising debt cause Thames Water to sink under a Labour government?",
        "content": "If Labour triumphs in this week’s election, as polls suggest, then top of the incoming business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’s in-tray will be the possible collapse of Thames Water. The Thames timebomb is ticking – and could explode before new MPs have even become fully acquainted with the corridors of Westminster. To recap, Britain’s biggest water company has been labouring under an £18bn debt mountain and has become the chief target of mounting anger from the public and politicians towards the industry over sewage spills, executive pay and shareholder payouts. In March, Thames investors refused to stump up a pledged £500m of emergency funding amid a standoff with the industry regulator, Ofwat. So acute are concerns that the government has tasked officials with making contingency plans for a temporary renationalisation, codenamed Project Timber. Its finances were back in the spotlight this week, when the Guardian revealed that a £150m dividend paid out from the regulated company on 27 March – hours before investors pulled the plug – was being examined by Ofwat. An internal party dossier by Labour’s chief of staff, Sue Gray, seen by the Financial Times, put the company’s potential collapse high on the party’s “risk register” after taking power, alongside prison overcrowding, bankrupt councils and an NHS funding shortfall. One of the first tests will be the postponed publication of Ofwat’s proposals for the water industry on 11 July. The regulator had been due to release its draft “price review 24” – the process by which it determines how much each company can charge customers over the following five years – on 12 June, but the pivotal moment was delayed by Rishi Sunak’s soggy early election announcement. Thames’s own five-year plan, submitted in October and updated in April, is at the heart of its standoff with shareholders, who fear Ofwat’s response to it will be too stringent. The company has promised an extra £1.1bn to tackle environmental issues on top of the £18.7bn already pledged, to be paid for in part by raising bills 59%, including inflation. The regulator has indicated it is reluctant to impose large increases on struggling households. Investors will be combing Ofwat’s draft for an indication on the weighted average cost of capital it will allow companies, allowing them to calculate their returns. Last time round, some water firms successfully appealed Ofwat’s findings to the Competition and Markets Authority. The documents will also be scrutinised to see whether the regulator will allow companies to build less than they promised, or the same projects at a cheaper cost, amid an industry pledge to spend £96bn on infrastructure, from new reservoirs to sewage treatment plants. Thames, which serves about 16m households, is also due to publish its much anticipated annual results imminently. Sources said they were keen to examine whether the accounts, and those of the diverse collection of companies in Thames’s complex group structure, will be signed off on a going-concern basis, and whether they include a “material uncertainty” statement, as last year’s figures from parent company Kemble did. A source said the accounts were expected to be signed off at a board meeting on Friday and published by 15 July. Investors hope the various publications could clarify the prospects for the group. Options still include a complex restructure, a debt-for-equity swap and a government-handled special administration – in effect a temporary renationalisation. A source close to Kemble’s creditors said: “Obviously, the draft determinations are just a draft, but it will spark some activity.” Colm Gibson, managing director at Berkeley Research, said: “Analysts and investors should be wary of reading too much into Ofwat’s draft determinations, as there is scope for Ofwat’s position to move materially before final determinations are revealed in December.” He added: “Water companies have proposed large increases in their investment programmes just as they will face increased competition for staff and supply chain resources from the energy industry’s net zero programme, and a new government keen to invest in schools, hospitals, transport and other national … infrastructure. It will be interesting to see how this is taken into account in prices.” This week, Reynolds said he “wouldn’t want to see a nationalisation” of Thames. “I think there should be a solution that involves [something] short of that,” he told an event in the City of London, without specifying what that solution might be. Unfortunately for him, a testing financial squeeze at Thames may banish any post-victory party atmosphere before the balloons have even deflated.",

        "title": "Revealed: how Sunak dropped smoking ban amid lobbying from tobacco firms",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak abandoned his “legacy” policy to ban smoking for future generations amid a backlash from the tobacco industry in the form of legal threats, lobbying and a charm offensive aimed at Conservative MPs, an investigation reveals. The UK had been on course to become the first country to ban smoking for future generations, via the tobacco and vaping bill, which Downing Street hoped would help define Sunak’s place in British political history. An investigation by the Guardian and the Examination, a non-profit newsroom that investigates global health threats, has uncovered how the UK’s largest cigarette companies fought against the policy, which would have raised the smoking age by one year every year. After months of fierce opposition from the industry – and intervention from MPs and thinktanks with ties to tobacco firms – the proposal was excluded from the “wash-up” process, when outgoing governments choose which policies to fast-track and which to drop. The policy, which in effect banned smoking for anyone born after 2008, was left out despite MPs having voted in favour of it. Documents and freedom of information requests reveal how four of the world’s largest tobacco firms – the UK’s Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco International (JTI) and US-headquartered Philip Morris International (PMI) – put ministers on notice of a legal backlash. Imperial and BAT wrote to the health secretary, Victoria Atkins, in February, to claim the consultation process preceding legislation was “unlawful” because industry views had not been considered. The Department of Health and Social Care has said it did not need to consider industry views, pointing to guidance included in a World Health Organization global treaty, signed by the UK, that says governments should form smoking policy without influence from cigarette companies. The Marlboro-owner PMI and JTI, which makes Camel and Benson &amp; Hedges, said the treaty permitted interactions with cigarette firms if they were “necessary”. Imperial, which owns Lambert &amp; Butler and Gauloises, followed up its warning with a legal letter threatening a “judicial review” challenging the consultation process. Government lawyers responded by saying legal action might “derail” a bill that ministers believed could save tens of thousands of lives and billions of pounds in NHS costs. BAT, JTI and PMI were named as interested parties in Imperial’s letter, giving them the right to join as co-claimants if a judicial review went ahead. Imperial, which sells half of all of the cigarettes smoked in the UK, has not filed court proceedings but a spokesperson said the company was “keeping the situation under review as we monitor legislative developments”. The legal threats came after the industry opposed the legislation in its submissions to the consultation, despite claiming publicly that they wanted to phase out cigarettes. PMI’s chief executive, Jacek Olczak, indicated in 2021 interviews that it could stop selling cigarettes in the UK within 10 years. However, the company’s UK subsidiary told the consultation it “did not support the age of sale ban as outlined”, arguing instead for “further restrictions” on “combustible tobacco” – ie cigarettes – instead of an outright ban. PMI told the Guardian the bill risked “confusing” consumers because it included restrictions on some smoke-free products such as vapes, adding that it “firmly believes in phasing out cigarettes, to the benefit of the 6.4 million adult smokers in the UK”. BAT, which has previously advocated for a “smokeless” future, proposed raising the age of sale to 21 instead. As the government pressed ahead with its plans despite opposition, tobacco firms courted rightwing and libertarian Tory MPs. In January, three months after Sunak announced his policy on smoking, the then Clacton MP, Giles Watling, attended a “business lunch” with officials from JTI. Two months later, he went to the company’s annual party at the British Museum in London. In May, he proposed an amendment that would have replaced Sunak’s proposals with a new minimum age of 21. “We are strongly of the opinion that engagement results in better and more informed policy and is therefore in the best interests of all relevant parties,” JTI said. Watling did not return requests for comment. Other MPs targeted by the tobacco industry included the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch. The Imported Tobacco Products Advisory Council wrote to her in March complaining about the “open dismissal of industry views in the decision making process”. Its secretary general, Tatiana Camacho, accused the health department of “taking a position that seems to go against the spirit of collaboration and inclusiveness”. A month later Badenoch voted against the smoking ban at its second reading in the Commons, posting on X at the time: “The principle of equality under the law is a fundamental one … We should not treat legally competent adults differently in this way, where people born a day apart will have permanently different rights.” Two Conservative MPs, including Badenoch’s closest political aide, also attended a lunch and drinks reception hosted by the smoking lobby group Forest, days before the tobacco bill was in effect shelved. The Beat the Ban event, at Boisdale restaurant in Belgravia, London, featured beermats depicting Sunak as a nanny, an allusion to the ban being a “nanny state” measure. Badenoch’s parliamentary private secretary, Alexander Stafford, attended alongside fellow Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell. Tobacco lobbyists present included Camacho and Richard Cleary, who left Badenoch’s department to join Imperial in January. Stafford has said he does not smoke but opposed the ban as a “lover of freedom, a lover of choice and a lover of information”. He and Rosindell did not return a request for comment. The Forest director Simon Clark said the organisation did not seek to persuade MPs who attended to oppose the bill becoming law but did outline the group’s position in a speech. The government also came under pressure from rightwing thinktanks funded by the tobacco industry during the consultation process. In total, there were 307 responses in which the respondent disclosed ties to the tobacco industry, including from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and Adam Smith Institute. Both have received funding from JTI, while the IEA has also received money from Imperial and BAT. BAT, the owner of Lucky Strike and Rothmans, said: “We are clear that combustible cigarettes pose serious health risks, and the only way to avoid these risks is not to start smoking or to quit. “However, we do not believe that a generational sales ban will have the desired impact given the serious unintended consequences that are likely to follow, such as age verification being difficult to manage, and an increase in illicit trading.” The Conservative party did not return requests for comment. • This article was amended on 1 July 2024. The smoking ban that was abandoned by the Conservative government would have effectively banned smoking for anyone born after 2008, not 2009 as an earlier version said.",

        "title": "Thames Water board approved £150m payout hours before funding U-turn",
        "content": "The board of Thames Water agreed to pay a £150m dividend hours before its shareholders U-turned on plans to pump emergency funding into the struggling water supplier, the Guardian can reveal. The water industry regulator was examining the decision by the debt-laden company’s board to sign off the payout at a meeting on 27 March, sources said. The following day, the company said an imminent £500m injection of funds that had been pledged by its investors would not be paid, amid a standoff with Ofwat. That decision threatens to tip Britain’s water company into public hands, with Whitehall officials war-gaming its temporary renationalisation. Ofwat planned to investigate the circumstances around the dividend paid by Thames, sources said. At the time, Thames was already under investigation over its decision to pay a separate £37.5m dividend. Thames Water’s fate is one of the biggest issues facing the next government, with the company labouring under £15.6bn of debt, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse. Thames said it was too early to know what the outcome of Ofwat’s inquiries into the dividend payment would be. The company, which has a complex corporate structure, said the payment was made from the regulated company to an intermediate parent company, Kemble Water Eurobond, to “settle a pension top-up payment” and “surrender relief” on tax losses. In March the company and its shareholders drew heavy criticism when investors refused to pay £500m of promised funding. Michael Gove, the communities secretary, said the leadership of the company had been a “disgrace”. In December the Guardian revealed that Ofwat was examining a £37.5m dividend paid from its regulated operating company to its ultimate owner, Kemble. While the £150m payout did not go to Thames shareholders, Ofwat has been clamping down on the flow of cash from ringfenced water companies to holding companies, amid concerns that payouts are weakening the finances of regulated water and sewerage firms. In May 2023 it modified the conditions of water companies’ licences to stipulate that companies must explain how dividend decisions were made and how they “reflect overall performance, alongside investment and financial resilience needs”. The regulator can take action where a company has failed to meet the conditions. This month it emerged that Ofwat was considering fining the company £40m over the £37.5m payment on the grounds that it breached those rules on dividends. Sources close to the situation said a final decision on that possible fine was unlikely to be published before the regulator rules on water companies’ five-year spending plans next month. Ofwat is due to publish its draft response to water companies’ business plans on 11 July, after a delay caused by the general election. Thames’s annual results need to be published by 15 July. The company, which serves about 16m households, faces the prospect of a potential special administration, handled by the government, if it cannot raise fresh funds from investors. Officials are drawing up contingency plans for a temporary nationalisation under the codename Project Timber. A Thames Water spokesperson: “We take our licence obligations very seriously, including those relating to the declaration and payment of dividends. “In March 2024 we settled with our intermediate parent company, Kemble Water Eurobond, an interim dividend to enable it to settle a pension top-up payment on Thames Water’s behalf and to surrender group relief for full-year 2023 tax losses. These transactions were cash and reserves neutral for Thames Water Utilities Limited, which is the regulated business, and increased the company’s financial resilience. “Ofwat does not assert any potential breach by Thames Water of its licence and it is too early to know the outcome of Ofwat’s enquiries in relation to this matter.” Thames said its ultimate shareholders, which include the Canadian pension fund Omers and the British university staff pension scheme USS, had not received a dividend since 2017 and it did not plan an “external dividend” until 2030. An Ofwat spokesperson said: “We await the company to disclose its financial report including any dividend. We have new powers to act against companies paying dividends that do not reflect companies’ performance for customers and the environment or which compromise financial resilience, and we will use them as appropriate.” A downgrade by the credit ratings agencies Moody’s and S&amp;P in April meant Thames Water could not pay dividends without breaching its licence. The water industry has faced mounting anger from politicians and the public over repeated sewage spills into Britain’s waterways during a period in which it has made significant payments to investors and handed executives large bonuses.",

        "content": "Time to wrap up (for a little while…) here’s today’s main stories: We’ll be back next week, when political drama on both sides of the channel may grip the markets…. We flagged earlier that there were technical problems affecting HSBC, Nationwide and Virgin Money. And PA Media are reporting that the UK’s biggest banks have been hit by glitches affecting digital banking, leaving some customers unable to send and receive money on what is commonly pay day for workers across the country. HSBC UK said there had been a “separate payments issue affecting multiple banks”, and Nationwide blamed a “third-party payments issue” for the glitches. Barclays also alerted customers to the issue, which has left some customers unable to send or receive payments. Wall Street has opened higher as traders welcome the drop in PCE inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 221 points, or 0.5%, to 39,385 points, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index is up 0.7%. Over in the US, the Federal Reserve’s favourite inflation measure has dipped. The PCE price index rose by 2.6% in the year to May, down from 2.7% in April. Encouragingly for the Fed, underlying inflation fell too. Core PCE, which strips out food and energy, also slowed to 2.6% in May, down from 2.8%. Supercore PCE, which tracks the prices of core services excluding housing, also cooled…. This may reassure the Fed that inflation is easing back towards its 2% target, which could encourage it to consider cutting interest rates later this year. James McCann, deputy chief economist at abrdn, says: “Following an alarming acceleration at the start of the year we continue to see signs that inflation in cooling again, which will be a huge relief for the Fed and financial markets. This month’s data showed a tepid increase in underlying price pressures, with this weakness spread across the inflation basket. Alongside signs of easing activity rates these figures look consistent with the soft landing the Fed has been hoping for. However, the central bank won’t be celebrating yet. Indeed, the message from Chair Powell and others has been that an extended run of softer inflation data is needed to make them confident that inflation heading sustainably back to their target. The upshot is that while the door remains open for a September rate cut, it seems more likely that a cautious central bank will wait a little longer before pulling the trigger on easing.” Back in Paris, the stock market has hit its lowest level since late January. The CAC 40 share index of France’s largest companies has dropped by 0.9% today, ahead of Sunday’s parliamentary vote. David Morrison, senior market analyst at fintech and financial services provider Trade Nation, says: Investors should prepare for potential market volatility on Monday, particularly in the, admittedly unlikely, event that Marine Le Pen’s RN party won an outright majority. Travellers at Gatwick Airport have been hit by disruption today, when its runway was briefly closed. Gatwick’s runway has reopened after being closed earlier today; the airport has blamed a “departing aircraft having hot brakes” for the disruption. Happily, the runway has reopened – but plenty of flights out fo Gatwick have been delated (see the latest here). Flight tracking website Flightradar24 reported the closure of the runway at 12.53pm and stated at 1.14pm it had reopened, PA Media reports. Shares in Nike have tumbled 15% in pre-market trading, after the sportswear company reported a drop in sales. Nike missed expectations by posting fourth-quarter revenues of $12.61bn for the last quarter of its financial year, to 31 May, a 2% fall compared with the previous year (when sales totalled $12.83bn). Revenues for Nike’s Converse brand tumbled by 18% in the quarter, which the company says is primarily due to declines in North America and Western Europe. Nike also forecast a surprise drop in fiscal 2025 revenue; it expects a mid-single-digit percentage fall in annual revenue, Reuters reports, as customers favour newer brands such as On and Hoka. John Donahoe, President &amp; CEO of Nike, told shareholders: “We are taking our near-term challenges head-on, while making continued progress in the areas that matter most to NIKE’s future – serving the athlete through performance innovation, moving at the pace of the consumer and growing the complete marketplace.” French election uncertainty may also be hitting European equities. Bank of America reports today that European stocks saw outflows of $2.1 billion in the last week, their most in 14 weeks. Over in Germany, the number of people out of work has risen faster than expected. New figures from the Federal Labour Office today show the number of unemployed grew by 19,000 in seasonally adjusted terms. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a smaller rise, of 15,000. This has lifted Germany’s unemployment rate to 6%, from 5.9%, indicating the labour market is cooling. Curiously, there is also an issue with banking services at Virgin Money today. It says some customers have been hit by delays to payments both in and out of their Virgin Money accounts….. On the French elections, analysts at Investec say: Politics continues to be the dominant focus in France too, with the first round of the National Assembly elections on Sunday 30th. Candidates with over 50% of the vote in each constituency will be elected straight away. Where this does not happen, contenders with support of at least 12.5% will go to a second round on Sunday week (7 July). The risk continues to be that the decision to call a snap election backfires badly for Macron – polls still suggest that the Assembly will be dominated by the hard-right FN (with the most seats) and the left to hard-left NFP, rendering political ‘cohabitation’ between an FN government and a centrist Elysée difficult to say the least. Nationwide customers are also experiencing some banking problems today, Sky News reports. Nationwide said there was a “delay with some customers receiving their salary or pension payments today”, Sky says. The financial markets have taken the UK’s general election in their stride, but the same cannot be said across the Channel! The premium investors demand to hold French government bonds, compared to debt issued by Germany, has today jumped to its highest since the euro zone debt crisis in 2012. Reuters reports that the spread between the French and German borrowing costs - a measure of the extra return investors demand to buy France’s debt - has widened to 84.5 basis points today, the widest since September 2012. [When bond prices fall, the yield (or effective interest rate) on the bond rises, and today French bonds have dropped more than the German equivalent]. That throws a spotlight on market nerves about this weekend’s parliamentary elections, in which the far-right National Rally and an alliance of left-wing parties are both polling ahead of president Macron’s centrists: The first round of voting for the French national assembly takes place this weekend. Yesterday, Marine Le Pen has said she expects her far-right National Rally (RN) party to win an absolute majority in France’s general election, form a government and take over at least some defence and armed forces decision-making – including on Ukraine. European officials fear that a RN victory would pose existential questions about France’s role in the EU, and severely constraining the bloc’s capacity to get things done. There is fresh uncertainty today over the future of steelmaking in South Wales. Tata Steel told workers yesterday it could to cease operations at its steel plant in Port Talbot two months earlier than planned because of a strike scheduled for early next month. The company had been planning to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But workers at the south Wales site have been told that Tata plans to cease operations at both furnaces no later than 7 July because of the strike by members of Unite, which starts the following day. The company said the strike meant it could no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. A Tata Steel spokesperson said: “In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely operate our assets in a stable fashion through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations (including both blast furnaces) on the Port Talbot site. The unios are protesting against plans to switch from blast furnace production to a greener electric arc furnace, with the loss of thousands of jobs. More here: Greenpeace UK’s head of climate, Mel Evans, warns that closing the blast furnaces early would have ‘devastating consequences’ for steel workers: “Tata should be listening to its steelworkers, not slamming the door behind them as soon as they threaten to walk out. A better deal for green primary steelmaking is possible, and with less than one week to go until the UK elects a new and, potentially, more sympathetic government, closing the steelworks before those newly elected ministers have sat down at the negotiating table is a costly mistake. It will have devastating consequences for the thousands of steelworkers set to lose their jobs, for the local community, and for steel production in the UK. We need a just transition for workers in the UK, and Tata must wait for a new government to ensure that Port Talbot and its steelworkers have a safe and secure future, producing greener, cleaner steel.” Insurance company Allianz Trade has revised up the UK’s global risk rating. The UK is one of 15 countries who are now seen as a less risky place to do business, due to stronger macro-economic figures.. Allianz Trade says that the UK’s global risk rating has been upgraded from AA2 to AA1, “in a pre-election boost to the next UK government”. It explains: Stronger GDP growth in the UK and effective inflation management signal a brighter outlook, tempered by concerns over service prices, continuous wage growth and a potential shift in government. Portugal, Turkey, the UAE, Hong Kong, and Albania are among the other 14 to get an upgrade, while Estonia and Kuwait were downgraded: Allianz Trade reports that global country risk is showing signs of improvement despite lingering uncertainty and geopolitical risks, adding: Global economic growth is expected to recover slightly to +2.8% in 2024-25 after bottoming out in the first half of the year. However, the manufacturing sector still faces excess supply and low demand, particularly in the Eurozone, where recession risks remain. With inflation moderating at a slower pace, central banks in the US and Eurozone are taking a cautious approach to easing monetary policy that is reverberating into the monetary policy of emerging markets. The increase in the household savings rate in the first quarter of this year (see earlier post) suggests that people may have more cash set aside, which they could spend later this year if economic confidence picks up. Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, explains: “The good news is that consumer confidence has been improving gradually over the last year and UK consumers’ confidence in their personal finances has reached the highest since 2021 as the impact of rising real wages filters through into people’s pockets. We expect this to continue over the next year. That suggests household savings patterns will start to return to more normal levels in the first half of the year. “On that basis, we think the improvement in households’ real incomes that is set to intensify later this year will translate into an increase in spending that will drive the emerging economic recovery and finally drag the UK out of stagnation.” A “Tell Sid”-style ad campaign featuring Sir Trevor McDonald was filmed to promote the government’s now shelved plan to sell state-owned NatWest shares to the public, the Guardian revealed this morning. The nationwide campaign – which included TV ads featuring the veteran newsreader and presenter popping up around the UK asking the public “Are you in?” – is understood to have been backed by a large-scale media budget in excess of £10m. Media sources said the campaign had been scheduled to launch within days when Sunak pre-empted it by announcing an early summer election outside 10 Downing Street on 22 May. While much of the eight-figure ad spend set aside for it by the government will not have been used, some of the budget will have been spent on coming up with and filming the concept. More here…. Whoever wins next week’s election could also inherit a recovering housing market. UK house prices are tipped to climb slightly higher by the end of the year, but to still lag household income growth. Property data site Zoopla forecasts that UK house prices will be 1.5% (£3,900) higher by the end of 2024, after prices were flat in May. Zoopla’s latest house price index shows that UK house prices are currently ‘over-valued’ by 8%, but are set to return to ‘fair value’ by the end of the year as incomes rise. It says: House prices have seen rises across all areas over the last 3 months to May 2024, however annual house price growth remains negative across southern England despite rising elsewhere. The housing market continues to shrug off the UK election campaign (just a week to go!), with sales agreed 8% higher than a year ago, and demand 6% higher. Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla says: “The housing market continues to adjust to higher borrowing costs through modest house price falls and rising incomes. Buyers using mortgages are also relying on longer mortgage terms to gain that extra few percentage points of buying power to afford a home. The general election campaign has had a limited impact on market activity although the seasonal summer slowdown is arriving. Sales agreed continued to increase and more homes for sale means more buyers looking to move in the second half of the year. The timing of the first cut in the base rate is a key moment and will give a boost to both market sentiment and sales activity. Overall we expect house prices to be 1.5% higher over 2024” Away from the GDP report, customers of HSBC bank are having trouble accessing their online and mobile banking services. HSBC says it’s “really sorry”, and are working hard to fix it. Several customers are unhappy with the disruption; data on website DownDetector shows that more than 7,000 customers had complained of problems this morning. Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, also predict the economy kept growing in the current quarter, saying: “All the data suggests that the economy is set to continue to rise in Q2. “We then expect growth to accelerate in the second half of this year and into 2025 as sharply lower inflation, tax cuts and falling interest rates give households an income boost.” Looking ahead, the EY ITEM Club expects UK GDP to grow at a decent pace in Q2 (April-June). However, growth probably won’t be as fast as the 0.7% recorded in Q1 Peter Arnold, EY UK chief economist, says: The composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) averaged the same level in Q2 as Q1. However, the earlier-than-usual Easter appeared to boost consumer activity in March at the expense of April, while strike action in the healthcare sector in June will likely drag on output this month. Therefore, the EY ITEM Club thinks quarter-on-quarter GDP growth will probably come in a bit softer than Q1’s strong rise. “Further ahead, the EY ITEM Club expects low inflation and persistently strong pay growth to mean real household incomes continue to grow strongly. Provided rising consumer confidence results in households gradually moving away from the cautious sentiment exhibited over the last year, the EY ITEM Club thinks there is a prospect of a decent consumer-led recovery.” Although the pick-up in growth in January-March is clearly welcome, the broader economic picture is that living standards are lower than at the end of the previous parliament. New data from the Resolution Foundation this morning shows that real per capita household disposable incomes were lower in early 2024 than they were back in late 2019, They have calculated that RHDI has fallen by 0.6% since the end of 2019, or 0.1 per cent a year on average, leaving average incomes £120 a year lower per person over the whole period since the last election. That means the current parliament remains on track to be the worst for living standards growth since the 1950s. This is partly due to recent economic shocks, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost of living crisis. But the living standards slowdown can be traced back further – since 2010, typical real non-pensioner household disposable incomes have grown by just 0.5 per cent a year on average. Adam Corlett, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, says: “The last five years have been terrible for living standards growth. Disposable incomes in early 2024 were still lower than they were at the 2019 election, by around £120 per person. Income growth over the parliament so far has been worse than in any other since the 1950s, and the third worst in post-Edwardian Britain. “Britain is far from alone in experiencing a tough five years – many other countries have been badly affected by Covid-19 and the cost-of-living crisis straight after that. But Britain’s longer-term record on growth is also weak and we remain poorer than many of our peers. Addressing this great living standards slowdown is the ultimate test for whomever wins the election.” Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, has spotted good news on the economy in today’s GDP report: Within the service sector, the highest rate of growth was for the professional, scientific and technical activities sectors, which rose by 1.8%. This was driven by a 7.2% increase in research and development and a 3.3% increase in legal activities. These are high value activities for the UK economy, and growth in this area bodes well for the future of the UK. This may go some way to mitigating the decline in business investment last quarter. Today’s GDP growth upgrade is the final official piece of UK economic data ahead of next Thursday’s general election. In the last couple of weeks, we’ve learned that inflation has fallen back to the 2% target, but also that unemployment – and wages – are rising, while growth fizzled out in April. Neil Shah, director of research at Edison Group, says: The latest UK GDP data shows that Britain’s economy grew quicker than expected in the first quarter of the year, expanding by 0.7% from the previous quarter. This shows that the UK economy still showed slow growth, rather than the most timely monthly estimate that showed no growth in April 2024. Particularly, services grew by 0.8% on the quarter with widespread growth across the sector; elsewhere the production sector grew by 0.6% while the construction sector fell by 0.6%. These figures are released less than a week before the General Election, serving as a last check on economic growth. These figures show that the UK economy is slowly starting to turn corner, confirming that the Britain’s economy exited a shallow recession at the start of 2024. Albeit slow, the economy has increased in the latest quarter following two consecutive quarters of negative growth and is slowly showing signs of a bounce back despite significant headwinds. The upward revision to Q1 GDP growth from 0.6% quarter-on-quarter to 0.7% q/q this morning (see opening post) suggests whoever is Prime Minister this time next week may benefit from the economic recovery being a bit stronger than expected. So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. He told clients that the economy may grow faster than expected this year – a boost to the winner of next Thursday’s general election. The larger rise in GDP in Q1 was mainly due to upward revisions to consumer spending (from +0.2% q/q to +0.4% q/q) and the contribution from net trade (from +0.4ppts to +0.6ppts) more than offsetting downward revisions to government spending (from +0.3% q/q to 0.0% q/q) and residential investment (from +4.1% q/q to +3.2% q/q). The revision suggests that real GDP growth in 2024 as a whole may be more likely to come in a bit above our existing forecast of 1.0%. Dales adds: It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too. This underpins our forecast that consumer spending will be the main driver of a rise in GDP of at least 1.0% this year and about 1.5% next year. Should the saving rate fall back from its unusually high level, the economic recovery could be even stronger. This is certainly good news for whoever will be the Prime Minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise. The UK stock market has opened higher, as traders digest today’s upgrade to UK GDP. The FTSE 100 index has gained 40 points, or 0.5%, to 8220 points, recovering yesterday’s drop. So far his year, the Footsie has gained over 6%. Mark Preskett, senior portfolio manager at Morningstar Wealth, says: “The upward revision to the UK’s Q1 GDP is encouraging and further evidence that the UK economy is recovering. The services upgrade - to 0.8% from 0.7% - backs what we have been seeing in inflation data. “Among UK equities, we are seeing increased dividend payments, share buybacks and M&amp;A activity this year, and this suggests some of the positive economic activity is translating into improved shareholder returns.” Bad news! UK business investment was weaker than first estimated at the start of this year. Today’s UK national accounts estimates that business investment increased by 0.5% in the January-March quarter, down from the previous estimate of 0.9% growth. Compared with the same quarter a year ago, business investment is estimated to have fallen by 1.0%. This is a blow, as business investment is key to achieving improved productivity, and growth. Rising interest rates have been making it harder for businesses to invest. UK real households’ disposable income (RHDI) is estimated to have grown by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in Q4 2023. This is a measure of how much income a household is left with, after tax, once you’ve adjusted for inflation. The ONS reports that wages rose in the last quarter, but so did the tax take….. Within RHDI, nominal gross disposable income saw growth at 1.1%, because of an increase in compensation of employees of £4.3 billion. This was itself driven by an increase in wages and salaries of £3.0 billion and a decrease in households’ actual social contributions paid by employees of £3.4 billion, which was driven by the reduction of the employees’ National Insurance contribution rate. This was offset by a rise in taxes on income and wealth of £3.6 billion, which was driven by an increase in taxes on self-employment of £3.1 billion and an increase in the implied deflator of 0.4%. Interestingly, the UK’s household savings ratio has risen – showing that people have more excess cash than at the end of last year. The household saving ratio is estimated at 11.1% in the January-March quarter, up from 10.2% in October-December. This ratio measures the average percentage of disposable income that is saved. The ONS says this is driven by an increase in pensions, in income from wages and salaries, and by the cut in national insurance rates at the start of the year. GDP per capita is a better measure of economic performance, as it measures how much the economy grew for each member of the population. And there’s good news here too, finally. Real GDP per head is estimated to have increased by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2024, up from a previous estimate of 0.4% growth. That follows seven consecutive quarters without positive growth. And on an annual basis, real GDP per capita – basically a measure of living standards – is estimated to be 0.6% lower compared with the same quarter a year ago. This table, from today’s national accounts, shows how the UK was the fastest-growing G7 member in Q1…. ….but lags behind many rivals when you look at growth since the pandemic. As you can see, the UK (+0.7%) posted the fastest quarter-on-quarter growth in Q1, ahead of Canada (+0.4%), Italy and the US (both +0.3%), France and Germany (both +0.2%) and Japan (which shrank by 0.5%). But since the end of 2019, the UK has grown by 1.8%, slower than the US, Canada, Italy, France and Japan, but better than Germany which has barely grown since. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK economy grew faster than previously thought at the start of this year, as it emerged from last year’s short recession. Newly updated GDP data, just released, shows that the economy grew by 0.7% in January-March. That’s up from a previous estimate of 0.6%, and confirms that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy in the first quarter of this year. That could bolster Rishi Sunak’s argument that the economy is turning a corner, ahead of next week’s general election. The Office for National Statistics released this encouraging news in the UK’s latest GDP quarterly national accounts, for January to March 2024. They show that the UK’s services sector expanded by 0.8% in the quarter, up from a previous estimate of 0.7% growth. Production, though, is now estimated to have grown by 0.6%, revised down from a 0.8% increase. The construction sector shrank by 0.6%, as builders were hit by bad weather this year. The ONS reports: In expenditure terms, there were increases in the volume of net trade and household spending, partially offset by falls in gross capital formation and government consumption. The household saving ratio is estimated to be 11.1% in the latest quarter, up from 10.2% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2023. Real households’ disposable income (RHDI) is estimated to have grown by 0.7% in Quarter 1 2024, maintaining the same growth as the previous quarter. Today’s GDP report also confirms that the economy shrank in the second half of last year – contracting by 0.1% in quarter 3, and 0.3% in quarter 4 – a technical recession.

        "content": "A former Fujitsu engineer has been accused by a lawyer acting for victims of the Post Office scandal of “hiding” problems with the Horizon IT system to protect the “out of control monster”, a public inquiry heard. Gareth Jenkins, formerly a senior engineer at Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon IT system, faced tough questioning by lawyers acting for post office operators caught up in the scandal, which has been described as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in recent history. The Post Office prosecuted hundreds of operators, blaming them for financial losses in their branches when in fact the Post Office Horizon IT system was unreliable and had bugs, errors and defects. A public inquiry is examining what went wrong. Jenkins was questioned about the criminal prosecution of Seema Misra, a post office operator who was pregnant with her second child in 2010 when she was convicted at Guildford crown court of theft and sentenced to 15 months in jail. She had to give birth wearing an electronic tag. She was exonerated by the court of appeal in 2021. Jenkins was an expert witness for the Post Office at her trial. Flora Page, the barrister representing Misra, likened the Horizon IT system to a “monster” and put to Jenkins that “hundreds of innocent people had already had their lives ruined to protect it but you don’t accept that do you?” “I was not aware of that at the time, no.” Jenkins said. “Isn’t the truth that you knew Horizon was a monster and that it was causing harm?” Page continued. “No, that was not how I felt,” Jenkins replied. “You hid it, didn’t you?” she continued. “No, I did not,” he replied. Page told Jenkins that Misra had been convicted on the strength of his witness evidence and he had not mentioned all “the body parts” of the flawed IT system including the hardware failures and “terrible code”. Misra was at the inquiry watching as Jenkins was questioned about evidence he gave to her trial in Guildford, which had been seen by the Post Office as a test case of the Horizon system. Page told Jenkins that he had “thrown mud in the jury’s eyes” and “hid all these problems when you gave evidence against Seema Misra, even though she was standing right there in the dock in front of you”, Jenkins replied: “I don’t believe I deliberately hid anything.” The inquiry continues.",

        "title": "Labour urged to step in over Tata’s plans to close steelworks days after election",
        "content": "Labour politicians have been urged to step in to help avert a “costly mistake” by Tata Steel, which has told staff it could close operations at its steel plant in Port Talbot just days after the general election. The Indian owner of the vast south Wales steelworks said on Thursday that it intended to cease operations at two blast furnaces on the site by 7 July – three days after the general election – in response to strike action announced by Unite members from 8 July. The company had planned to shut one furnace by the end of June and a second by September. About 1,500 workers across Port Talbot and another site at Llanwern intend to strike over Tata’s decision to close its blast furnaces, cutting 2,800 jobs. The company said: “We cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely operate our assets in a stable fashion through the period of strike action.” A Tata Steel spokesperson called on Unite to cancel the industrial action and said it had began legal action to “challenge the validity of Unite’s ballot”. Tata called on Unite to consider “the company’s proposed memorandum of understanding, which puts forward a wide-ranging proposal including generous employee support packages, training, and skills development”. The decision has angered politicians and unions, who have argued that the Tata should wait until after next Thursday’s general election, which Labour is predicted to win. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, and Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, have pledged up to £3bn to support the industry’s transition to low carbon steel production, which is expected to include honouring an existing £500m package of government support for Port Talbot. A new electric arc furnace will be built by the end of 2027. Torsten Bell, the former chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank who is standing as Labour candidate for Swansea West, said on X that Tata’s decision was “incredibly worrying”. He wrote: “Safety is of course paramount but Tata should avoid taking any action that cannot be reversed before seeing the result of the general election. “We need to see everyone getting round the table. It is crucial we don’t lose the chance for the company and unions to sit down with an incoming Labour government, given the commitment from [Reynolds] and [Reeves] to a £2.5bn steel renewal fund.” Onay Kasab, Unite’s national lead officer, said the union had asked for a meeting to discuss how to operate the site safely during the industrial action – the first steel strikes in 40 years – since it was called last week. He said that meeting had happened on Friday morning and safety plans were still being discussed with the company. Kasab said: “To issue that statement last night knowing full well the meeting was today – it’s about trying to create fear and uncertainty among the workforce. Safety is paramount. Our argument is that the blast furnace does not have to be turned off before the electric arc furnace comes on, so of course we are not going to take action which means it is turned off. “We are calling for the decision-makers in Mumbai to get involved in the discussions and we want Labour to stick to their commitment.” Alun Davies, the national officer for steel at the Community union, said: “We went ballistic when we saw the communication and asked for an urgent meeting. Reynolds needs to sit down with the company to see to quickly put things in place.” Keir Starmer, when launching Labour’s election campaign in Wales last month, said he would “fight for every single job and fight for the future of steel in Wales”. Vaughan Gething, leader of Welsh Labour, said: “We will not support the closure of both furnaces. This will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. He added: “Urgent and good faith negotiations are required to ensure safety on site and avoid a severe and lasting impact on Port Talbot, Wales and the UK.” Greenpeace UK’s head of climate, Mel Evans, said: “Tata should be listening to its steelworkers, not slamming the door behind them as soon as they threaten to walk out. “A better deal for green primary steelmaking is possible, and with less than one week to go until the UK elects a new and, potentially, more sympathetic government, closing the steelworks before those newly elected ministers have sat down at the negotiating table is a costly mistake. “It will have devastating consequences for the thousands of steelworkers set to lose their jobs, for the local community, and for steel production in the UK.”",

        "content": "The UK economy grew at a faster rate than previously thought in the first quarter of 2024, handing the next prime minister an improved economic backdrop. Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% in the first three months of 2024, revised upwards by the Office for National Statistics from a first estimate of 0.6%. The first-quarter figures were lifted by growth in the services sector, up by 0.8%, as well as the production sector, which expanded by 0.6%, although that was revised down from 0.8% in the initial estimate. Other areas of the economy fared less well, with bad weather hampering the construction sector, where output fell by 0.6%. The data confirmed that the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during the first quarter after a short recession in the second half of last year. Real household disposable income – how much each home is left with after tax, adjusted for inflation – is estimated to have increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to the ONS. The strength of the economy has been a big issue in the general election campaign after voters suffered a squeeze from higher inflation and increased mortgage rates over the past three years. Rishi Sunak has insisted that the UK economy has turned a corner but the latest encouraging data comes less than a week before polling day. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said living standards – as measured by real household disposable income per head – were up by 2.4% as a result of pay rising faster than prices. Despite the improvement as cost of living pressures have eased, living standards over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole fell by 0.6%, leaving the average person £120 a year worse off than they were at the time of the last election. Adam Corlett, the thinktank’s principal economist, said it was only the third time since the first world war that living standards had been lower at the end of a parliament than at the start. The UK economy showed no growth in April, with an increase in the services sector offset by falls in production and construction after heavy rain hampered building work and deterred shoppers from spending on the high street. However, more recent figures show consumer confidence is returning – bolstered by falling inflation and stronger retail sales. UK inflation fell to 2% in May returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years. Figures released last week showed retail sales bounced back with 2.9% growth in May after a weather-affected drop of 1.8% the previous month. Economists said the improving economy was likely to benefit the incoming prime minister, with the Bank of England widely expected to cut interest rates later this year. “It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too,” said Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the research company Capital Economics. “This is certainly good news for whoever will be the prime minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.” Dales said the household savings ratio – the proportion of disposable income saved rather than spent – stood at 11.1% in the first quarter, its highest level since the second quarter of 2021. Households tend to save more when they feel uncertain about the future, and the savings ratio rose during the cost of living crisis. Dales said that should the savings ratio come down from its “unusually high level” growth could be stronger than the 1% and 1.5% he was expecting for 2024 and 2025 respectively.",

        "content": "The video game services company Keywords Studios has said it is prepared to accept £100m less from its private equity suitor, after revealing that a slowdown in the sector had led to a number of its projects being cancelled or delayed. The Swedish private equity investor EQT originally put forward a £25.50 a share offer for Keywords, a 70% premium on its market price in May, worth £2.2bn. However, Dublin-headquartered Keywords said in a company filing on Friday that EQT had since dropped its offer to £24.50 a share, taking the total price down to £2.1bn. It follows a due diligence review by EQT, which showed a slowdown across the video game industry over the past six months was weighing on the company’s growth. Keywords explained that a small number of large game development projects had been delayed into the second half of the year or cancelled, and that it had been unable to find any work to replace them at such short notice. Keywords, which provides services to the developers of some of the world’s biggest games, including Fortnite, Clash of Clans, League of Legends and Assassin’s Creed, said it would cut costs as it waited for business to pick up. “The board is confident in delivering strong overall revenue and profit growth in 2024, with performance expected to be second-half weighted as the sector emerges from slower content creation trends that are currently dampening industry spend and therefore group growth,” it added. In the meantime, Keywords said it was “minded to recommend” the lower offer to its shareholders, meaning it was likely to become the latest company to leave the London Stock Exchange. Founded in 1998, the firm launched to help business software developers translate their products for release in other countries. In the early 2000s, it shifted focus towards games, and has since ridden the huge expansion in the size of the global industry, which far exceeds other entertainment sectors such as Hollywood or the music industry. Keywords listed its shares in 2014. Keywords offers a range of services, including producing games in whole or in part for other developers, producing voice and sound effects for games, translating games into different languages, and porting games between different platforms such as Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation. EQT has until 3 July to make a firm offer for Keywords, or walk away from the deal. Keywords’ shares were up more than 5% at £23 on Friday. If the deal goes ahead, it will add to a growing list of companies leaving the London Stock Exchange, amid concerns that UK firms remain undervalued by investors, and that the City is losing its edge against overseas rivals. In May, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, announced its decision to switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London. The British investment fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown said this month it would accept a proposed offer from private equity investors, in a move that would leave another hole in the FTSE 100 index.",

The company had been planning to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But workers at the south Wales site have been told that Tata plans to cease operations at both furnaces no later than 7 July because of the strike by members of Unite, which starts the following day. The company said the strike meant it could no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. A Tata Steel spokesperson said: “In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely operate our assets in a stable fashion through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations (including both blast furnaces) on the Port Talbot site. “That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.” Unite called the strike in protest at plans to switch to a more environmentally friendly way to produce steel, with the loss of thousands of jobs. The union’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “Unite is fighting for the future of the steel industry. We have secured serious investment from Labour to safeguard jobs. Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won’t deter us. “The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it’s about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and south Wales. “We call on the real decision makers in Mumbai to take hold of this dispute, sit down, negotiate and realise that the investment secured will be good for the company and workers.” Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, the GMB national officer, said: “This is a sad day for steel. Tata must step back from this irreversible decision and safeguard steelmaking assets. There’s a general election in days that could change everything so much. “We know there is a future for steelmaking in south Wales. That future must be preserved. GMB’s next actions will be decided by our members.” The Community and the GMB unions are also campaigning against the plans but have ruled out taking industrial action before the general election. The unions expect an incoming Labour government to hold emergency talks with Tata to discuss alternatives to its proposals. Tata has made it clear it is pressing ahead with switching from blast furnace production to a greener electric arc furnace and it is investing £1.25bn into the project. The company says it is currently losing £1m a day at Port Talbot, which it has warned is unsustainable. The company offered an enhanced redundancy package to workers affected by the plans, but this was reduced after Unite members started industrial action short of a strike earlier this month.",

        "title": "BrewDog sacks Asian woman after reaction to EDL members meeting in bar",
        "content": "BrewDog has been accused of sacking an Asian woman after she voiced her distress when members of the far-right English Defence League met in the London bar where she worked. The former staff member said members of the EDL had gathered unchallenged at the “punk” brewer’s flagship bar in Waterloo, ahead of a rally to mark St George’s Day on 23 April. Police went on to arrest 10 people at the event, after groups of men tried to break through cordons in an areas of Whitehall, while glass bottles were also thrown. The former BrewDog staff member said she had gone to see her manager in a podcast studio located in the bar after she arrived at work to find that suspected members of the EDL were drinking in the bar before the rally. BrewDog accused her of “aggressive behaviour and use of inappropriate language” after she raised her concerns, according to documents seen by the Guardian. “This was not the case at all,” Myriam – not her real name – told Tribune magazine, which first reported the story. “All I said was ‘I can’t fucking believe this. This is fucking unbelievable.’ I didn’t swear at my manager … When I read the accusation, it completely broke me. I was scared, upset, heartbroken. I felt powerless. This is my job. I have bills to pay. I had a breakdown.” Myriam sent a message to her manager apologising for the strength of her emotions and asked him to put himself “in the shoes of a brown woman in this situation”, adding that her family had faced racial abuse from the EDL when she was growing up. In a letter to Myriam, BrewDog said it acknowledged her “past trauma and emotional state” but that she had been guilty of serious misconduct worthy of dismissal with notice. The trade union Unite said it was concerned about BrewDog’s treatment of staff. “We shall be doing everything we can legally and industrially to ensure that our members at this and every Brewdog receive the justice they deserve,” said Bryan Simpson, lead organiser at Unite Hospitality. While the EDL did not make a booking at the BrewDog bar, Myriam said they were “allowed to sit there and drink before their rally, which always end up violent”. BrewDog, based in Aberdeenshire, is understood to have been informed by police a day earlier that EDL members were likely to gather in the Waterloo area and might visit the bar. Police told the company not to close the venue and offered assurances that officers would be present. Myriam said staff were not told about this and said the lack of advance warning was a factor in her reaction. Colleagues were extremely uncomfortable about the presence of the EDL and one was in tears, she claimed. One member of BrewDog staff who dealt with her disciplinary hearing appeared to be unaware of what the EDL was, she added. BrewDog, which built a reputation as a “punk” challenger to mainstream beer brands, has faced multiple allegations of poor treatment of staff. In 2021, the company apologised to former employees who accused the company and its co-founder, James Watt, of fostering a “culture of fear” in which workers were bullied and “treated like objects”. Watt has since stood down as chief executive, saying he wanted to focus on other ventures, although he remains on the board. BrewDog told Tribune: “The standards of behaviour we expect from our colleagues are set out in our workplace code of conduct. There was a clear and unacceptable breach of this code in this instance. We followed all relevant processes and complied with our investigation and disciplinary policies, and we stand by our decision.” The Guardian has approached the company separately for comment.",

        "title": "BP has scaled back its green energy plans – don’t be surprised if it happens again | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "Grand corporate strategies are launched in weighty declarations by chief executives who fancy themselves as visionaries. That was how Bernard Looney, the then chief executive of BP, did it back in February 2020 when he said the company would get serious about cutting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in renewables. “The direction is set. We are heading to net zero. There is no turning back,” Looney told his City audience. By contrast, the watering down of ambition tends to happen in increments. Thus, when Looney last year scrapped BP’s aim to reduce hydrocarbon output by 40% by 2030, versus 2019’s level, in favour of a 25% cut, he claimed the change was a case of “leaning in” to the same strategy, just in the new circumstance of a world that was worrying more about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And now comes today’s BP chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, with his own adjustment. This one is genuinely more of a tweak: BP will slow its investment in low-carbon projects, which mostly means offshore wind in this case. The intention – at least for now – is still to complete the 9.5GW of capacity in unbuilt off-shore projects in the UK, Germany and the US. But don’t expect to see BP turbine blades start spinning until late in this decade, and don’t expect the company to bid for more wind licences unless the circumstances are truly exceptional. The corporate game is now about delivering “a simpler, more focused and higher value company”. BP, it should be said, is still streets ahead of most of its rivals in terms of its transition strategy. Chevron and ExxonMobil in the US, for example, are unembarrassed about their determination to be oily for longer. And BP is the only major to have a formal target to reduce oil and gas output. It is why Auchincloss can still maintain that his refrain about moving from “IOC to IEC” – from international oil company to integrated energy company – is intact. Yet his next action will be the one to watch. The stock market, as everybody knows by now, is rewarding the US titans with higher share ratings because they have an easier financial story to tell: energy transition globally is happening at a slower pace than imagined a few years ago, and their expertise lies in oil and gas, where immediate demand is still high. BP, by contrast, is in “trust us” financial territory for what it calls its “five transition growth engines”, which also include biogas, electric vehicle charging points, hydrogen and – nonsensically – convenience stores on forecourts. Since it hasn’t actually built any windfarms yet, it is not in position to demonstrate achieved returns. Therein lies its credibility issue with the market. So where does Auchincloss go next? As the continuity choice for the top job, radical change was never on the cards in year one. But you have to wonder what year two will bring. Would anyone be surprised if BP’s renewables ambitions were scaled back again? Increments add up, and Looney’s “no turning back” mantra feels a long time ago.",

        "title": "BP imposes hiring freeze and halts new offshore wind projects",
        "content": "The head of BP has imposed a hiring freeze and halted new offshore wind projects, in an apparent attempt to placate investors who are unhappy with the oil company’s green targets. Murray Auchincloss, BP’s former finance chief, took up the role of CEO in January after the shock departure of his predecessor, Bernard Looney, with a promise to focus on delivering value for shareholders. Looney, who had committed BP to some of the industry’s greenest climate goals, was ousted last September for failing to disclose relationships with colleagues. The decision to slow BP’s green ambitions has stoked concerns that Looney’s plan to move the company away from fossil fuels, with a pledge to “become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner”, may soon be derailed. BP has come under pressure from shareholders over its green targets because some renewable projects have proved more costly than expected, and profits from oil and gas have soared after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. In response, the company set out plans earlier this year to cut oil and gas production by just 25% between 2019 and 2030 – well short of its previous target of a 40% reduction over the same timeframe. Greenpeace UK said BP’s plans were “disappointing but sadly unsurprising”. Areeba Hamid, its joint executive director, said: “Murray Auchincloss had a chance to build on his predecessor’s legacy and become part of the solution to the climate crisis, rather than its harbinger. Instead, BP is following other fossil fuel majors by abandoning renewables and doubling down on oil and gas in the hopes of a quick buck.” Auchincloss is reportedly looking at investing in and possibly acquiring new oil and gas assets to strengthen BP’s existing operations, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico and the shale basins acquired from the Anglo-Australian miner BHP in Texas. Earlier this month BP’s rival Shell set out its own plans to scale back its green growth ambitions, reducing the number of staff working on low-carbon solutions by about 200 roles while shifting the focus towards high-profit oil projects and expanding its gas business. Alice Harrison, the head of fossil fuels campaigning at Global Witness, said: “Since the energy crisis began earning [BP] record-breaking profits, it has shown its true colours, slashing its climate targets and renewables investments in favour of earning a quick buck from increased fossil fuel production.” Over the past four years, BP has built up a sizeable portfolio of offshore wind projects capable of generating 9.5 gigawatts of energy in total in the UK, Germany and the US that are yet to be developed. It wants to focus on these assets, it is understood, rather than bidding for new renewable projects. It has reassigned dozens of people tasked with finding new renewables opportunities to its offshore wind projects in Britain and Germany, Reuters reports, and could make some job cuts in renewables. The hiring freeze is expected to have a few exceptions for frontline roles. BP shares were up more than 1% on Thursday, but have underperformed rivals in recent months, prompting speculation that the company could be a takeover target. Looney set out a “net zero” plan that originally aimed to cut the company’s oil production by 2030, while others plan to increase their fossil fuel production. BP is also investing in biofuels and low-carbon businesses that can generate returns in the short term. A week ago the company agreed a $1.4bn (£1.1bn) deal to take full ownership of its Brazilian sugar and ethanol joint venture, but it said it was scaling back plans for development of new biofuels projects. BP said: “As Murray Auchincloss said in February, BP’s destination – transforming from international oil company to integrated energy company – is unchanged, but we are going to deliver as a simpler, more focused and higher-value company. “We set out six priorities that underpin this, including driving greater focus into the business, on to activities that create the most value, as well as delivering both the next wave of efficiencies and BP’s growth projects.” Auchincloss has pledged a “more pragmatic” approach to BP’s green targets since taking up the CEO role permanently in January. In May, BP said it would cut $2bn of costs by the end of 2026, after reporting lower than expected profits for the first quarter of the year. Auchincloss said he planned to make the savings by choosing fewer new projects to invest in over the coming years.",

        "content": "Boeing has been sanctioned by the top US accident investigator for having “blatantly violated” regulations by revealing private information to the media and speculating about what caused January’s cabin panel blowout on a brand-new airplane operated by Alaska Airlines. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it is cooperating with the Department of Justice, which is deciding whether to prosecute Boeing after declaring it had breached a settlement over two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. After a door plug blew off a 737 Max 9 shortly after it took off from Portland, Oregon, forcing an Alaska Airlines crew to engineer an emergency landing, the NTSB launched an investigation. The panel appeared to be missing four key bolts, it found. In an excoriating statement on Thursday, the NTSB said Boeing violated its regulations and a signed agreement the agency has with the company by providing “non-public investigative information” and “speculating about possible causes” of January’s incident during a media briefing. “As a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few entities know the rules better than Boeing,” the NTSB said. Under new restrictions and sanctions imposed by the agency, Boeing will no longer have access to information the agency produces as it continues its investigation. Boeing organized the media briefing, which took place on Tuesday, as it scrambled to tackle the concerns of regulators, airlines and passengers about quality and safety on its production line. But an executive at the company “provided investigative information and gave an analysis of factual information previously released”, the NTSB said. Both actions are banned under Boeing’s agreement with the agency, signed at the start of the Alaska investigation. The NTSB said Boeing had painted the agency’s investigation “as a search to locate the individual responsible for the door plug work” during the briefing. This is not the case, it clarified: “The NTSB is instead focused on the probable cause of the accident, not placing blame on any individual or assessing liability.” After hearing about the briefing, the NTSB demanded additional information from Boeing, which provided a transcript that the agency said showed the disclosure of unverified and unauthorized information. “In addition, Boeing offered opinions and analysis on factors it suggested were causal to the accident.” The NTSB said it plans to “provide details” of the incident to the justice department’s fraud division. A spokesman for Boeing said: “As we continue to take responsibility and work transparently, we conducted an in-depth briefing on our safety and quality plan and shared context on the lessons we have learned from the 5 January accident. “We deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are taking, overstepped the NTSB’s role as the source of investigative information. We apologize to the NTSB and stand ready to answer any questions as the agency continues its investigation.”",

        "title": "Financial markets at risk of ‘sharp correction’; US GDP revised high – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up… The Bank of England has warned that financial markets are at risk of a “sharp correction” in the future, as investors are only focusing on good economic news. The BoE says: The prices of many assets such as shares and bonds remain high relative to historical norms, and some have continued to rise. This suggests that investors in financial markets are continuing to expect the economy to recover and inflation to fall. They are placing less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation, that might cause weaker growth or interest rates to stay higher than expected. These risks make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices that could ultimately make it more costly and difficult for UK households and businesses to borrow. In its latest financial stability report, the BoE also warned that millions of UK households who are paying relatively low mortgage rates will see monthly repayments jump in the next two years. It also flagged the risk that global elections could destabilise the UK financial system…. while China’s property slowdown is another threat. In other news… The US economy grew a little faster than thought in the first quarter of the year, by an annual rate of 1.4%. Japan has issued fresh warnings over the weakness of the yen, which has hit a 38-year low against the US dollar this week at around 160 yen to the $. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has been valued at about $210bn based on the value of insider shares being sold in a tender offer, There are new signs of weakness in the US housing market today. Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes unexpectedly fell in May, by 2.1%, indicating that high mortgage rates and expensive homes are deterring buyers. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that pending home sales fell in the densely populated South and the Midwest on a monthly basis, but rose in the Northeast and West. Year-over-year, all U.S. regions registered reductions. “The market is at an interesting point with rising inventory and lower demand,” said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun, adding: “Supply and demand movements suggest easing home price appreciation in upcoming months. Inevitably, more inventory in a job-creating economy will lead to greater home buying, especially when mortgage rates descend.” Labour shadow business secretary has said the party would rather have stability in the UK’s relationship with the Europe than try to seek accelerated economic growth by rejoining the EU’s single market or customs union. Addressing the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference on Thursday, Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that Brexit had been “very difficult for businesses” because it erected trade barriers, but said reopening the debate would be worse. With less than a week to go until polls open in the general election, Reynolds was trying to woo business leaders at the London event with a pitch that emphasised policy stability and encouraged businesses to invest. More here. Back in the UK, a former Bank of England policymaker has predicted the central bank could cut interest rates at its next meeting in August. Michael Saunders, who served on the Monetary Policy Committee from 2016 to 2022, believes the BoE would start to lower borrowing costs if inflation and wage data align with its forecasts. Saunders told the Reuters Global Markets Forum (GMF) today: “They have clearly signalled they are willing to cut soon if data are okay. “If so, I would expect the rest of the internal (members of the BoE MPC) to move as a bloc to vote for a cut. The US GDP report shows that America’s manufacturing sector shrank by 1.1% in Q1. The services sector grew by 1.9%, though, while government added 2.3% more value. Despite the small upgrade to US growth in January-March, the economy still slowed compared with the October-December. Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm, says: “The third reading on US first quarter GDP came in at an annualised 1.4% according to revised figures, up from the predicted 1.3%, but lower than Q4 2023’s strong print of 3.4%. This tepid growth continues to highlight concern of a broader economic slowdown. “The increase in real GDP primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, residential fixed investment, non-residential fixed investment, and state and local government spending. “Looking ahead, forecasts suggest a potential rebound in GDP for the second quarter, with estimates pointing to growth rates of 3% or more, similar to the robust performance seen in the latter half of 2023. However, several factors could temper expectations for the rest of the year, including the state of inflation, high interest rates, and the impending presidential election. All these factors may force businesses to adopt a cautious stance on new investments.” The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless support has dipped, by 6,000. There were 233,000 fresh ‘initial claims’ for unemployment support last week, down from 239,000 in the previou seven days. Today’s US GDP report also shows that Americans earned, and saved, a little less than previously estimated in the first quarter of the year. Disposable personal income increased $240.2 billion, or 4.8 percent, in the first quarter, a downward revision of $26.6 billion from the previous estimate. Real disposable personal income increased 1.3 percent, a downward revision of 0.6 percentage point. Personal saving was $777.3 billion in the first quarter, a downward revision of $19.3 billion from the previous estimate. The personal saving rate—personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income—was 3.8 percent in the first quarter, the same as the previous estimate. Just in: the US economy grew a little faster than previously thought in the first quarter of this year. New data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that US gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 1.4% in the first quarter of 2024. That’s the equivalent of growing by 0.35% quarter-on-quarter….and is up from the prevoius estimate of 1.3% annualised growth. The BEA says the increase primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, housing investment, business investment, and state and local government. But, a fall in inventory investment weighed on GDP, as did a rise in imports. This chart shows why the Bank of England has concerns about private equity risk management (see earlier post)… Here’s economist Julian Jessop of the Institute of Economic Affairs on today’s financial stability report: Uncertainty caused by a global wave of elections, starting this weekend in France, risks destabilising the UK’s financial system, the Bank of England has warned. Officials are concerned about the kind of policies that newly elected governments may enforce in large economies, including the US, where Donald Trump is vying for another term as president in the run-up to the election in November. The French president Emmanuel Macron’s shock announcement of a parliamentary election, with a first round of voting on 30 June and Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party forecast to make significant gains, had shown how political uncertainty could impact economic growth forecasts and cause volatility in financial markets, affecting government debt prices, the Bank’s financial policy committee (FPC) said. More here. There’s no shortage of newsy lines in today’s financial stability report. Another one, is that the Bank of England believes that risk management in the private equity sector needs improving. The BoE says an investigation of the sector showed it was facing challenges from higher borrowing costs (because increases in interest rates have hit borrowers who loaded up on debt when it was cheap). The Bank says: Although the [private equity] sector has been resilient so far, it is facing challenges in the higher rate environment. These manifest in refinancing risk as debt matures, and an increased drag on performance from higher financing costs. In response, Michael Moore, chief executive of the BVCA (British Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association), says: The Bank has rightly highlighted the long-term stability and resilience of the private equity industry and the vital role it has played in the UK economy for over 40 years, and we welcome their acknowledgment of the importance of the sector to the economy. Many of the Bank’s concerns are already being addressed through new regulatory activity by the FCA, and we at the BVCA remain highly engaged in these processes. Over in the US, retail giant Walgreens Boots is planning to close some underperforming US stores and cut its profit forecasts today. Walgreen Boots now expects to make an adjusted profit of $2.80 to $2.95 per share for its financial year ending August, compared with its $3.20 to $3.35 per share forecast in March. The company says it is finalizing a “significant multiyear footprint optimization program” to close certain underperforming US stores. Chief executive officer Tim Wentworth says Walgreen Boots continues to face “a difficult operating environment”, due to the pressures on US consumers. He adds: “Informed by our strategic review, we are focused on improving our core business: retail pharmacy, which is central to the future of healthcare. We are addressing critical issues with urgency and working to unlock opportunities for growth. Many of these actions will take time, but I am confident that we have the right team and the right strategy to lead a business turnaround for the Walgreens that our customers and patients need.” Today’s Financial Stability Report recognises the forthcoming French elections as a potential geopolitical risk, points out Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool’s management school: In light of the forthcoming French elections, the French cost of borrowing continues to rise -albeit slightly- over the past week as does the Italian one. My brand new piece for the LSE Business Review blog looks at the rising political uncertainty in France and assesses the risk of contagion effects in Europe and the UK through the banking channel. European and British banks have a notable exposure to French public and domestic debt (around 10% their total exposure worldwide), which (according to the Chart in the piece) has increased over time. Something for ECB’s and BoE’s monetary policymakers to keep an eye on over the next few days and weeks… The Bank of England also warns that “significant downside risks remain” from China’s property market. Today’s financial stability report points out that activity in the mainland Chinese residential property sector continues to decrease, with the prices of new and existing homes falling this year: Disorderly defaults by property developers have been avoided so far, the Bank of England says, even though some large Chinese property developers have missed bond payments without agreed extensions. Chinese authorities have put various measures into place to support the housing market, which has helped support housing demand. The Bank warns, though, that the ongoing market adjustment will weigh on China’s economy for some time – and could potentially spill over to the UK economy, saying: The adjustment in the property sector, alongside broader structural trends, is likely to weigh on growth in China for some time. Property accounts for a significant proportion of household wealth in China; much higher than in the US, for example. That means falls in sales and residential property prices are likely to continue to impact Chinese consumption and growth. There have been limited spillovers to the UK so far from the adjustment in mainland China’s property market. However, significant downside risks remain. More widespread crystallisation of risks in mainland China could lead to spillovers to the UK and other countries, and could be larger if the crystallisation of property sector vulnerabilities were to spread to other sectors in the Chinese economy. Risks could spill over to the UK financial system through channels including weaker trade, financial markets, and global risk sentiment. Today’s Bank of England’s report shows high borrowing costs still pose a threat to the stability of the financial system, points out Karim Haji, global and UK head of financial services at KPMG. Haji adds that banks need to keep supporting customers who need help: “While there are signs that a brighter economic outlook is starting to feed through to resilient consumers and businesses, the Bank of England’s report shows high borrowing costs still pose a threat to the stability of the financial system. The good news is UK banks are in rude health, with strong capital and liquidity positions allowing them to support people even if the economy does worse than expected. It is incumbent on them to continue supporting vulnerable customers.” The Bank of England is concerned that the flurry of elections taking place this year could cause financial instability. Today’s report says: Geopolitical risks remain high and there is policy uncertainty associated with elections set to take place globally. This could make the global economic outlook less certain and lead to financial market volatility. The Bank cites the drop in French government bond prices, and shares in Paris, this month after Emmanuel Macron called snap parliamentary elections. They say: Markets responded to the unexpected announcement that French parliamentary elections would be held on 30 June and 7 July. For example, the spread between French and German 10-year government bond yields rose to its highest level since 2017. The US presidential elections, in November, are also an obvious source of risk and uncertainty, with Joe Biden and Donald Trump due to face off in a debate tonight. The City has been unspooked by the UK election next week, though, with JP Morgan suggesting that a Labour election victory will be a “net positive” for financial markets. If markets suffer a sharp correction, it would hurt the cost and availability of finance to the real economy through two main channels. The BoE says. First, a sharp market correction would make it more costly and difficult for corporates to refinance maturing debt, including by reducing the value of collateral. This is particularly relevant given the large proportion of leveraged lending and high-yield market-based corporate debt that is due to mature by the end of 2025. Second, it could interact with vulnerabilities in market-based finance, which may amplify the correction. For example, it may cause large losses for leveraged market participants, which could further reduce risk appetite, or it may lead to a spike in liquidity demand and a deterioration in the functioning of core markets. Millions of UK households will be hit by rising mortgage costs over the next two years, the Bank of England says, even though interest rates may have peaked. Its new Financial Stability Reprt shows that around 30% of mortgagors are likely to see mortgage costs rise by more than £100 a month by the end of 2026. That’s because borrowers will continue to come to the end of their fixed-rate deals, meaning they’ll have to refinance onto higher rates. Today’s Report says: With continued strong income growth and low unemployment, the aggregate amount of debt held by UK households relative to their income has fallen further since Q1. That said, many UK households, including renters, are still facing pressures from the increased cost of living and higher interest rates. The share of households spending a high proportion of their income on mortgage payments is still expected to increase slightly over the next two years. But the overall share of households who are behind in paying their mortgages remains low by historical standards. It adds: Over the next four years, the vast majority of fixed-rate mortgagors were expected to refinance, most at rates higher than they currently paid. A smaller group, predominantly those on variable-rate mortgages, could see a reduction in their monthly payments. The Bank also predicts that mortgage arrears will increase further, but are likely to remain well below their early 1990s and post-GFC peaks of 4.0% and 2.4%, respectively. This is despite interest rates having risen by more since 2021 Q4 than in past tightening cycles, it adds. The Bank of England also warns that some firms will struggle with the impact of higher interest rates in the years ahead. But most UK businesses remain ‘resilient’ to the economic outlook, today’s financial stability report says: We still expect most UK businesses to continue to be resilient to the economic outlook, including high interest rates. However some firms are likely to struggle with higher borrowing costs in the coming years. Firms with a large amount of market-based debt which still needs to be refinanced, and where a high proportion of income is being spent on repayments, are likely to come under the most pressure. Newsflash: The Bank of England has warned that financial markets remain at risk of a sharp correction. In its latest financial stability report, the BoE says that high inflation, or geopolitical risks, could trigger a selloff. The Bank says risks to the UK financial system are “broadly unchanged” since the first quarter of the year. But some asset prices have continued to rise, it points out, while the risk of a sharp correction persists. European markets are up around 8% so far this year, while the US Nasdaq Composite index has surged by 18%. The report, which is designed to track the stability of the financial system, says: The prices of many assets such as shares and bonds remain high relative to historical norms, and some have continued to rise. This suggests that investors in financial markets are continuing to expect the economy to recover and inflation to fall. They are placing less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation, that might cause weaker growth or interest rates to stay higher than expected. These risks make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices that could ultimately make it more costly and difficult for UK households and businesses to borrow. The report also warns that Global risks are material, including geopolitical risks, which remain high. Overall, UK households and businesses have remained resilient to the impact of higher interest rates. The UK banking system is strong enough to support households and businesses, even if the economy does worse than expected. The French stock market has dipped this morning, with the CAC40 share index down 0.2%. Traders are jittery ahead of the first round of voting in the national assembly elections this weekend. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, says: European markets have kicked off a somewhat indecisive start to the day, with the German DAX providing the one glimmer of light as the likes of the FTSE 100 and CAC head lower. While we saw early gains for French stocks, the fact that we are seeing them fade once again comes as no surprise as we approach the weekend election. Yesterday saw yet another poll that pointed towards further gains for the far-right National Rally party, with a Macron loss becoming increasingly likely. Nonetheless, while the Bloomberg poll of polls has NR and its allies at 36% of the vote, the fact that this remains well below the 50% marker highlights the fact that we will likely have to wait until next Sunday to find out the result. With that in mind, traders should expect a jittery period ahead, with the fears of a fresh surge in borrowing costs and financial instability driving potential CAC and euro weakness. Over in Tokyo, the government has warned that high interest rates in the United States and Europe are hurting the yen, and risking economic damage. In a monthly report, a cabinet office official flagged that “fluctuations” in the marketss should be watched closely. The report says: “The Japanese economy is recovering at a moderate pace, although it recently appears to be pausing. “The economy could face downside risks from the effects of continued high interest rate levels in the United States and Europe. Full attentions should be given to fluctuations in the financial and capital markets.” Some analysts are forecasting that Tokyo could intervene to support the yen if it fell as low as 165 to the dollar. ING point out that the intervention two months ago was triggeed by a 10 yen move in USD/JPY. They told clients: In April, USDI/JPY had risen from a low of 150 to a high of just below 160 over a little less than a month when Japan intervened… In the past 30 days, the low was 154.60, which would by the same logic place the intervention level at 164/165. The yen is still trading over 160 to the dollar, above this new “line in the sand” of 165…. The number of job openings at UK companies has dropped by a fifth compared with a year ago, hiring platform Indeed reports. In its Mid-Year Labour Market Update, Indeed shows job postings are slowing as the labour market cools. The technology industry, and the beauty &amp; wellness sector, are among those seeing the fastest slowdown in hiring. The report also found, though, that wage pressures remain strong, particularly in lower-paid roles. Here’s the key points: Foreign jobseeker interest is up— the share of searches for UK jobs from abroad is up 40% from its pre-Covid average. Roles remain hard-to-fill despite foreign interest - the jobs foreign jobseekers are most drawn to are software development, engineering and mathematics. However, engineering and software development roles remain some of the hardest-to-fill in the UK, meaning barriers remain in hiring this talent. Wage pressures still persist — Despite the labour market cooling, the Indeed Wage Tracker shows that posted wage growth rose to a four-month high of 6.5% year-on-year in May, driven by lower-paid roles, with childcare wages up the most at 8.6% year-on-year. Flexibility is a mainstay — the share of job postings mentioning remote or hybrid work has remained steady at around 15% of job postings in 2024, up from 13% in May 2022. Around 2.4% of jobseeker searches contained remote/hybrid terminology with the share remaining stable since 2022. Jack Kennedy, Indeed’s senior economist, says: “The UK labour market has continued its adjustment in recent months, though it remains somewhat tight and still competitive for employers in many sectors. Highly skilled jobs tend to always be harder to recruit for as they are naturally relevant to a smaller candidate pool. However, there is strong foreign interest in some of these jobs, meaning UK businesses may want to look at jobseekers from outside the country to fill gaps. While lower-paid jobs are generally easier to recruit for as the candidate pool is larger, persistently higher inactivity post-pandemic and post-Brexit immigration policy have made it harder than it used to be for employers to fill these roles. Tackling inactivity, a longer-term skills strategy and the role of immigration in addressing labour shortages will be agenda items for the elected government. The London stock market is a little subdued this morning, with the FTSE 100 down 8 points or 0.1% at 8217 points. Packaging firm DS Smith are the top riser, up 6.7%. Its takeover by US rival International Paper appears to be on track, after Brazil’s Suzano dropped its plans to merge with International Paper. Pharmaceuticals firm GSK is the top faller, down 5.2%, after US health officials recommended restricting vaccination with its RSV vaccine to people who are older and more at risk. That could reduce the market for the UK drugmaker’s blockbuster shot. SpaceX’s new valuation of $210bn is a record for an American private company: Just in: Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, has left interest rates on hold at 3.75%. But it also hints that rates could be cut as many as three times in the second half of 2024 if inflation prospects remain the same. The Riksbank explains: Inflation is close to the target and economic activity is weak. The Executive Board considers that monetary policy should be adjusted gradually, and has decided to hold the policy rate unchanged at 3.75%. Wet weather earlier this month has also slowed sales growth at British supermarkets, new data shows. Market researcher NIQ said sales at UK supermarkets rose 1.1% in the four weeks to 15 June year-on-year. That’s a slowdown on the 3.3% growth reported a month ago. The wet weather may have encouraged shoppers to buy groceries online rather than braving the shops; in-store sales fell 0.9% in the month to 15 June, while online sales increased by 3.7%. Shares in Swedish clothing retailer H&amp;M have tumbled 13% after reporting earnings that missed expectations this morning. H&amp;M also predicted a drop in June sales, suggesting they could fall by 6% in local currencies against the same period last year, partly due to poor weather in many key markets. It told shareholders: The unstable weather in many of the H&amp;M group’s large markets at the start of June 2024 had a negative impact on sales, but sales recovered as the weather normalised at the end of the month. CEO Daniel Ervér says H&amp;M group’s profitability performance during the first half of the year was strong. He warns, though, that external factors such as material costs and foreign currency rates, will have a more negative impact than expected in the second half of the year. Profits have dropped at motoring and cycling retailer Halfords. Halfords blamed continuing declines in the markets for car tyres and for cycling equipment, as consumer demand for big ticket purchases wanes. It made pre-tax profits of £19.9m in the last year, a 45% drop on the £36.2m the previous 12 months. On an underlying basis, though, profits before tax were in line with market expectations at £36.1m, down 18%. Halfords reports that the cycling market contracted faster than expected, leading to more promotional activity to shift stock. Elevated cost inflation continued to be a significant headwind, it adds. Looking ahead, Halfords predicts that market volumes for cycling and consumer tyres will fall in the current financial year: Trading since the start of FY25 has continued to be soft, impacted by low consumer confidence around big ticket, discretionary purchases, and poor spring weather, which has reduced store footfall and affected sales of both cycling and staycation products. Whilst we continue to expect market share gains in the year ahead, based on what we are currently seeing we now expect market volumes to decline in FY25 in cycling and consumer tyres, and to remain broadly flat in motoring servicing and retail motoring products. It’s also a busy morning for UK retailers, with several companies updating the stock market on their performance. Electricals seller Currys has reported a 10% rise in adjusted profit before tax, to £118m, but revenues have dropped 2%. Currys is hoping for a further boost from artificial intelligence, telling shareholders that the coming wave of AI led technology could be the most exciting tech cycle since the Apple iPad in 2010. Alex Baldock, Currys CEO, says: Encouraged as we are by our progress, we know we can go further. For one thing, we expect AI-powered technology to be the most exciting new product cycle since the tablet in 2010. With our partnerships, scale and expert colleagues to demystify AI, we’re best-placed to benefit. Japan’s Nikkei stock market has fallen by 0.8% today, losing 325 points to 39,341 points. A weaker yen is good for Japan’s exporters, so there may be some anxiety that Tokyo could intervene to drive the currency up again. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has been valued at about $210bn based on the value of insider shares being sold in a tender offer, Bloomberg reports today. SpaceX will sell insider shares at $112 apiece in a tender offer, a higher-than-expected price, that boosts the value of Elon Musk’s space and satellite company above its previous valuation of $180bn. SpaceX is considered one of the most profitable start-ups in the world, Bloomberg says, adding: The firm, which was founded in 2002 by Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, is one of the most prominent private manufacturers of spacecraft and satellites. It also offers satellite-based internet services through its Starlink subsidiary. The firm also holds a slew of contracts from NASA to provide spacecraft and crew equipment for orbital missions and support for the International Space Station. Earlier this month, SpaceX recorded the first fully successful test flight of its mighty space rocket Starship, when it splashed down successfully in the Indian Ocean. Japanese finance minister, Shunichi Suzuki, pledged today that authorities would take necessary actions on currencies after the yen slid to a 38-year low against the dollar. Japanese authorities are “deeply concerned” about the effect of the yen’s drop on the economy and are watching foreign-exchange moves with a high sense of urgency, Suzuki told reporters. He said: “It’s desirable for exchange rates to move stably. Rapid, one-sided moves are undesirable. In particular, we’re deeply concerned about the effect on the economy. We are watching moves with a high sense of urgency, analysing the factors behind the moves, and will take necessary actions.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Pressure is piling on Japan’s authorities to intervene in the foreign exchange markets, after the yen weakened to a 38-year low against the US dollar. The yen, which has been ailing for some months, has weakened to as low as 160.8 to the dollar, for the first time since 1986. That takes the yen below its low in April, when Tokyo was forced to intervene in the foreign exchange markets, burning through ¥9.8tn (£48bn) to prop up their currency. The yen’s weakness is due to the interest rate differential between Japan and the rest of the world. While most central banks hiked rates aggressively over the last coule of years, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) only ended its negative interest rate policy this spring, and has pegged borrowing costs to a range of 0%-0.1%. Yesterday, Japan’s top currency official, Masato Kanda, told reporters that the government was “seriously concerned and on high alert” about the yen’s decline and would respond to any “excessive” moves. This week’s weakness has prompted speculation that fresh intervention may be required. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says: The only thing that prevents the yen from a further fall is the direct intervention risk. But other than that, the yen deserves to lose more blood. One-year risk reversals, which show how traders feel about the yen over a longer time, hint that they’re still kind of excited about the yen compared to the dollar. But that excitement is fading fast as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) keeps delaying its intervention plans meanwhile the Federal Reserve delays its rate cutting plans Another option would be for the BoJ to raise interest rates, of course, and try to strengthen the yen organically that way. This may not be too controversial, since the weak yen is hitting Japanese households hard, explains Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, adding: They must deal with rising inflation, as import prices surge, which is also weighing on consumption. Wage growth is also below inflation, which is adding pressure to the Japanese authorities to act. Some argue that the BOJ need to adjust monetary policy and narrow the interest differential with the US and the rest of the world, as that is the most effective way to boost the yen. However, it would also require a shift in priorities at the BOJ, moving away from keeping yields low and stable, to a normalization of monetary policy like that in the US and across Europe.

        "title": "Global wave of elections could hit UK financial system, warns Bank of England",
        "content": "Uncertainty caused by a global wave of elections, starting this weekend in France, risks destabilising the UK’s financial system, the Bank of England has warned. Officials are concerned about the kind of policies that newly elected governments may enforce in large economies, including the US, where Donald Trump is vying for another term as president in the run-up to the election in November. The French president Emmanuel Macron’s shock announcement of a parliamentary election, with a first round of voting on 30 June and Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party forecast to make significant gains, had shown how political uncertainty could impact economic growth forecasts and cause volatility in financial markets, affecting government debt prices, the Bank’s financial policy committee (FPC) said. But it is the sheer number of elections taking place this year that was cause for concern, with more than 80 countries – more than half the world’s population –heading to the polls this year. That includes the UK, where citizens will vote in a general election on 4 July. “Policy uncertainty associated with upcoming elections globally has increased,” the Bank’s financial stability report said. Questions over a country’s political direction could amplify geopolitical risks, increase government borrowing costs, and lead to further global fragmentation, in a way that was “relevant to UK financial stability”, it said. The FPC said it was still monitoring the impact high interest rates were having on households and businesses in the UK, with the Bank’s monetary policy committee having held rates at 5.25% this month for the seventh consecutive time. That includes the 400,000 households whose monthly mortgage payments are expected to soar by 50% as they roll off fixed rates between now and the end of 2026. In total, about 3 million – or 35% – of mortgageholders are still on fixed rates of below 3% and are due to see their payments jump over the next two years. However, if headline interest rates drop from August onwards, as markets predict, another 2 million mortgageholders – including those on variable rates or coming off mortgages set at a higher level – could benefit, offsetting refinancing pressure for some households. There are also concerns about the financial system’s exposures to the $8tn private-equity industry, which boomed during a period of low interests rates and has grown to play a significant role in financing UK businesses. “Although the sector has been resilient so far, it is facing challenges in the higher rate environment,” the FPC said, noting this was becoming apparent as firms were forced to refinance their debt at much higher prices. The FPC said it had also found “gaps” in the way UK banks were managing their exposure to the private-equity industry. The Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority said they were working together to address a lack of transparency in overall borrowing levels, as well as the valuation of private-equity firms and their investments. Policymakers said they would continue to test the resilience of the UK’s banking sector, revealing they would be testing the industry against the possibility of two separate and “severe” economic shocks. The first – a “supply-shock scenario” echoing the ripple effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – would cause inflation and interest rates to soar to 12% and 9%, respectively, as geopolitical tensions disrupt supply chains and cause the price of global commodities to soar. The second “demand-shock scenario” – which has similarities to the impact of Covid-era lockdowns – assumes demand for global goods and services in decline, sending inflation and interest rates below 0.5% for a prolonged period of time. In both cases, unemployment is projected to peak at 8.5% and the property industry would take a big hit, with commercial real estate prices declining by nearly 50%. This year’s so-called desk-based stress tests are the second to be conducted without input from individual banks since they were launched a decade ago in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank of England will not release bank-by-bank results but will issue an aggregate report by the end of the year.",

        "title": "Currys looks to AI tech to drive growth as profits climb",
        "content": "The boss of the UK electrical chain Currys has said it stands to gain from the rise of artificial intelligence, with AI-enabled mobile phones and computers selling well, as the company battles to get back on track. Samsung’s Galaxy S24 mobile phone, which uses AI tools to offer better photography and instant translation, is one of its bestsellers, alongside more traditional products such as large, 85-in-plus TV screens, boosted by the Euro 2024 football tournament, along with air fryers, action cameras and drones. During the cost of living crisis, fewer consumers upgraded appliances, with demand for small electrical goods particularly affected. On Thursday, Currys reported a 2% drop in UK like-for-like sales in the year to 27 April, while revenues in Scandinavia fell by 3%. Even so, underlying profits before tax climbed by 10% to £118m. After three years of revenue declines, there were reasons to be more cheerful about the outlook for topline growth, said Alex Baldock, the Currys chief executive. He said: “When we look at what we sell, the coming wave of AI-led technology offers arguably the most exciting tech cycle since the Apple iPad in 2010.” AI tools “help consumers solve real problems”, he said, ranging from a long battery life of 22 hours and better camera skills to studio-quality sound for video conferencing. Currys said it was the first retailer globally to launch Microsoft Copilot+PC, a computer with an AI companion. Other new AI products include video games, which promise a better game experience and an end to online cheats. Companies such as Nvidia are working on characters controlled fully by AI to enable real-life conversations. Baldock said: “We’ve seen a depressed consumer environment in all our markets in recent years. That said, things are improving. Consumer confidence is turning up, and is nine points higher than it was a year ago. The big-ticket purchase index is also up.” The retailer is also using AI to improve its customer service, for example for the after-sales chatbot, working with its partners Accenture and Microsoft. Currys has become Microsoft’s first official retail repair partner in the UK. Guy Lawson-Johns, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “An increase in UK consumer confidence, driven by rising economic optimism, suggests that a recovery in discretionary spending may be under way. “But while margins have improved, prolonged weakness in consumer demand will be on everyone’s mind. A continued improvement will need to be seen before management can say the recovery job is done.” Currys shares fell by 6% in early trading on Thursday and later traded at about 4% lower, valuing the company at nearly £820m. The company rejected several bids from the US investment group Elliott in February, the last of which valued it at £742m.",

        "content": "May’s higher-than-expected inflation figures prompted a widespread gloom that the Reserve Bank of Australia would have to increase interest rates again – but there is narrow cause for hope for the country’s strained mortgage holders. The return of a headline consumer price index with a four in front of it for the first time since November – when the RBA last raised the cash rate – certainly stirred markets, the media and those in Canberra. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup There is now a better than one-in-three chance of a 14th rate rise when the bank’s board meets on 5-6 August, investors bet. Those hoping for certain relief in the form of a rate cut will have to peer well over the horizon towards November 2025. An early federal election called on the premise of falling mortgage costs, in other words, seems ruled out for now. In Sydney on Thursday night, the new RBA deputy governor, Andrew Hauser, will be pressed at the Citi A50 Australian Economic Forum over what he makes of the May inflation figures and whether the central bank board will lock in a rate increase when it next meets on 5-6 August. (Spoiler: he will do his best to not rule anything in or out.) To the cause for hope. Excitable punters and headline writers aside, the reality is the RBA has said all along it would be following the data. When it comes to inflation, the governor, Michele Bullock, has said she pays attention to the quarterly numbers and those won’t land until 31 July. What we do know is that the central bank forecasts for the June quarter already anticipate some acceleration in annual headline inflation from 3.6% in the first three months of 2024 to 3.8% in the April–June period. Taking into account we had 3.6% in April and 4% for May, technically we are still on that 3.8% course. The inflation bulls, for now at least, have grounds to claim validation. The trimmed mean inflation measure that the RBA generally cares most about did indeed tick up to 4.4% in May from 4.1% in April – hardly the trajectory to get back to a 2-3% target. The NAB promptly became the most pessimistic of the big four banks, pushing back their expectations for a rate cut from November this year until May 2025 – the last possible month the next federal election could take place. “The mix of slow growth and gradual progress on inflation reflects the RBA’s decision to embrace a ‘lower for longer’ approach – a lower rate peak compared to other advanced economies, resulting in a longer period at that peak,” Alan Oster, NAB’s chief economist, said in a note. “It is possible the board will change course and raise rates at its August meeting, especially if the [June quarter] print exceeds expectations, but with the labour market easing we don’t believe their hand will be forced.” ANZ moved a fortnight ago to predict the first cut wouldn’t be until February, while the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac are sticking for now with their November 2024 rate cut calls. Luci Ellis, formerly the RBA’s chief economist who took over as Westpac’s top economist just before the last rate rise, said that her bank “always” had its predictions under review. Ellis sees no need to shift Westpac’s forecasts just yet – not least because her team correctly picked the 4% May inflation result, compared with the market’s consensus view of 3.8%. What is key, though, is “whether or not the RBA [was] surprised by the number”, she said, adding that Hauser’s response to questions tonight may be revealing. And as Westpac noted on Thursday, “the monthly indicator only includes price updates for around 60% of the inflation basket and should be interpreted with caution”. John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra and formerly of both the Treasury and the RBA, also thinks people may be reading too much into the May data. “The CPI actually fell slightly in the month,” Hawkins said. “The annual rate only jumped as there was a big fall last May” when the rate fell to 5.6% from April’s 6.8% pace. Unless month-on-month prices rise by more than 0.6% in the current month, the annual percentage growth should return to a decline, he said. A 0.3% rise, for instance, would translate into a 3.7% quarterly pace or less than the RBA expects. “I don’t think [Wednesday’s 4%] number will force the [RBA] to increase rates,” Hawkins said. “But it won’t do much to ease their concerns that inflation is not coming down that rapidly.” “The path to an interest rate cut remains narrow but it is still there.”",

        "content": "Shares in the UK food delivery company Deliveroo have risen after reports that US rival Doordash held takeover talks with the business, with analysts suggesting other bidders could come forward in the coming weeks. Doordash flagged an interest in a takeover of Deliveroo last month, but talks ended because the two sides could not agree on the value of the deal, Reuters reported. The London-listed company’s share price jumped by 6% to 136p on Wednesday morning, and closed 1.2% up on the day, valuing the business at £2.1bn. Its value had fallen more than 50% since debuting on the stock market in March 2021. The much-touted float of a pandemic success story turned out to be a disappointment, leading to some traders calling it “Flopperoo”. Doordash’s New York-listed shares fell initially after the news broke on Tuesday, before recovering to close 1.25% higher. Analysts at the financial services company Jefferies said: “In this instance, the talks have failed. But such is the strength of the financial, industrial and strategic logic of a Deliveroo takeover, we would not be surprised to see similar such headlines to re-emerge in the short term. “In our view, the key to unlocking a recommended offer from Deliveroo is understanding the sensibilities of the founder CEO, Will Shu. This may only be the start.” Delivery apps including Deliveroo thrived during the Covid-19 lockdowns when people were stuck at home and restaurants were closed, but since then demand for online food delivery has waned. Investors’ preference for more profitable businesses amid higher interest rates has weighed on Deliveroo shares. The company works with 180,000 restaurants and retailers and runs a network of 140,000 riders. Amazon started investing in Deliveroo in 2019 and is its largest shareholder with a 13.2% stake, followed by the Cayman Islands-based venture capital firm DST Global with 7.5%, while Shu has a 6.5% holding. Amazon has previously been tipped as a potential buyer of Deliveroo. Deliveroo has come under fire for how it treats its riders, who are not employed directly and are paid for each delivery. Deliveroo and Doordash declined to comment on the takeover talks.",

        "title": "Fat fees for Royal Mail’s advisers, no detail for its shareholders | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "Surprise, surprise: the proposed £3.6bn takeover of Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), by a Daniel Křetínský-led bidding consortium will generate a fee bonanza for investment bankers, lawyers, debt-arrangers and assorted hangers-on. The grand total is £146m before VAT, with £89.1m falling on the acquirer and £56.9m on IDS, according to the formal offer document. It’s a hell of a sum, and the most infuriating element is the £36m that IDS has allocated for “financial and corporate broking advice”. Why? Because that’s the portion that is supposed to reflect the depth, quality and seriousness of the IDS board’s consideration of the fairness of 370p-a-share terms. For such an advisory bill, shareholders might expect maximum financial detail on why the directors rolled over. Instead, in his formal letter to shareholders in the offer document, IDS chair Keith Williams merely served up a cut-and-paste version of his previous sketchy explanation for surrender. Remember the force of the rejection of Křetínský’s initial shot in April at 320p. This line stood out as important: the offer didn’t take account of “the significant underpin of value through the group’s extensive freehold property portfolio [and] the pension scheme in material surplus”. So what is the value of the freehold portfolio? At the make-your-mind-up stage, shareholders might expect to be told, but they will search the 140-page document in vain. Having raised property as a major consideration at the outset, IDS’s board has never mentioned it again. Similarly, the board has offered no guidance on how shareholders should think about the £1bn accounting surplus, as of March this year, in the main Royal Mail pension scheme. The company can’t access the sum until the scheme is either wound up or transferred to an insurer via buyout, but one of those outcomes will probably happen eventually. So, while the current value of the surplus to the owner may not be £1bn today, one of those expensive City advisers must have modelled a few numbers. Again, though, the board has fallen silent on an issue it brought up itself. Of course, Williams has other reasons for regarding 370p as “fair and reasonable”: the need for investment in Royal Mail; competitive threats; uncertainty over whether regulator Ofcom will agree to the company’s proposal for a reduced second-class delivery service; and, most of all, the fact that the offer represents a 73% premium to the share price before the fun started. Yet IDS is best thought of as a sum-of-the-parts stock, which is how City analysts (many of whom are now gagged because their employers are advisers on the bid) always used to assess it. The biggest of those parts, even though it gets a fraction of the attention, is GLS, the very successful Amsterdam-based international parcels operation. The offer document revealed GLS is no longer expected to reach its previous target of €500m (£423m) of operating profit in 2026-27, but it is still a high-quality business that is the real underpin of the group-wide value. In the old days, it was commonplace to observe that GLS accounted for all of IDS’s stock market value. One doesn’t have to make too many optimistic assumptions about progress at Royal Mail – now shooting for break-even in the second half of this financial year – to think 370p is less than a knockout price. As argued here previously, fund managers – with the honourable exception of the objecting Columbia Threadneedle Investments – should be asking more questions. A bid for an important UK company is getting minimal financial scrutiny (and the Labour party still seems terrified of saying anything that could be misconstrued as anti-business). Mind you, the CWU union might also care to up its game. The other mystery is why the union thinks it stands a chance of getting Křetínský to gift “a serious stake” in Royal Mail to the workers post-takeover. Read the offer document: the bidder is merely “exploring” the idea of “potentially offering a form of employee participation”, such as a profit-share of unknown size. Unlike the fat fees for City advisers, it could hardly be more vague.",

        "title": "Human rights group urges UK financial regulator to block Shein’s LSE flotation",
        "content": "A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange. Stop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein’s cotton suppliers in China’s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing. Represented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that “any attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused”. The China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (£52bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians. On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein’s potential London listing would be a “badge of shame” for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm’s “questionable” labour and human rights standards. The fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: “Shein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.” Stop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company’s supply chains. The group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK’s convention obligations, it said. “The FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,” the group added. The Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: “Stop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn’t the place to come for a ‘no questions asked’ approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.” Stop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange’s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein’s supply chains. Stop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter. In the meantime, the campaign group’s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the “accuracy of its published modern slavery statement”. Under the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains. Leigh Day lawyers have urged the regulator to “refuse Shein’s listing application unless the FCA is satisfied that its products are not tainted by forced labour”. Rahima Mahmut, executive director of Stop Uyghur Genocide, said she was “deeply concerned” about Shein’s potential London listing and said the organisation had been highlighting concerns from national security and human rights experts that Shein “could be associated with egregious human rights abuses, including modern slavery, and pose ethical and security risks to businesses and citizens”. “Our investment community must not support companies like Shein who are reportedly linked to the Chinese state and which we believe may enable the ongoing genocidal policies against Uyghurs.” The FCA declined to comment on Shein’s potential listing. It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation. Before a company’s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company’s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA’s role to independently verify the accurate of information. Michael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: “A firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.”",

        "title": "L&G to sell Glencore stake over thermal coal concerns; global economy ‘on track’ for soft landing – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up. A major City investor has said it is divesting from mining giant Glencore and TK Maxx owner TJX over environmental concerns. Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM) announced it is adding Glencore and retailer TJX to its divestment list. The move will affect LGIM Future World fund range, LGIM’s ESG fund ranges, and all defined contribution auto-enrolment default funds in L&amp;G Workplace Pensions and the L&amp;G Mastertrust. Michelle Scrimgeour, CEO of LGIM, said: “With the world recently experiencing its first annual average temperature overshoot of 1.5˚C, the message is clear: there is much more to do to mitigate climate change, and we need to act now. “I have been encouraged by progress over the last 12 months, with many of the companies with which we have engaged making significant strides in important areas. However, it is clear that the pace of the transition is neither smooth enough nor fast enough. It is not the role of the asset management industry alone to tackle climate change: this is a whole of system transition, the pace of which is influenced by global public policy, regulatory standards and the nature of energy demand. Radical collaboration is therefore key – to drive aligned action and decarbonisation on a global scale.” Optimism is growing that the global economy will pull off a soft landing, as central banks move towards cutting interest rates. But UK retailers suffered a bump this month, with sales weaker than in June 2023. In the currency markets, the Japanese yen has hit a 38-year low against the US dollar, prompting concerns in Toyko. German engineering group Robert Bosch is reportedly weighing a bid for U.S. appliances manufacturer Whirlpool. Back in the UK, the Czech billionaire hoping to buy Royal Mail has confirmed he is considering offering employees a stake in the business, as his company asked shareholders to back its £3.6 billion takeover bid. As flagged this morning, Daniel Kretinsky’s EP Group set out its plans for the future of Royal Mail’s owner, International Distribution Services (IDS), in a letter sent to shareholders. In the offer letter, EP Group said it is “exploring, following completion of the acquisition, potentially offering a form of employee participation model in the business” which could include “profit-sharing” among all members of staff. Unions representing postal workers have previously called for staff to be given a stake in the company via a shake-up of its structure. Sales of new US single-family homes dropped to a six-month low last month,new data from the Commerce Department shows. New home sales declined 11.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000 units last month, the lowest level since November. This indicates that high mortgage rates are hurting demand, weakening the housing market. April’s sales data was revised higher, though, to show 698,000 units were sold (on an annualised basis), not the 634,000 units first reported. Japan’s currency chief has said the government is watching the yen with a high level of urgency, as the Japanese currency hits its lowest level since 1986 against the US dollar. Vice Finance Minister Masato Kanda told reporters that recent currency moves were rapid and one-sided, saying: “I have serious concern about the recent rapid weakening of the yen and we are closely monitoring market trends with a high sense of urgency. “We will take necessary actions against any excessive movements,. Kanda’s comments came as the yen fell, to 160 yen to the US dollar. The yen has weakened in recent months, as investors have lost confidence that the Bank of Japan will be able to raise interest rates, due to Japan’s weak economy. Today’s weakness puts pressure on Tokyo to intervene to strenthen the yen, by selling dollars. Over on Wall Street, shares in Rivian have surged after Volkswagen agreed to invest up to $5bn in the Amazon-backed electric carmaker. Volkswagen will initially invest $1bn as part of a partnership with Rivian to form a new, equally controlled joint venture to share electric vehicle architecture and software, the companies said on Tuesday. The deal is a significant win for Rivian, which is grappling with steep losses as it attempts to ramp up production of its electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. While EV startups have been dealing with a slowdown in demand amid high interest rates and dwindling cash, traditional automakers have struggled to build battery-powered vehicles and advanced software. Shares in Rivian’s stock have jumped by 30% in early New York trading, from $11.96 to $15.47, following yesterday’s announcement. Looking at the European economy, S&amp;P Global says activity in the eurozone is on the rise, with the May composite purchasing managers’ indices firmly above the expansion threshold. Today’s report says: The eurozone has exited the recent manufacturing recession, putting it cyclically ahead of the U.S. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to slow although the unemployment rate remains near all-time lows. Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain. Recent slower growth at the eurozone level reflects in part a faster passthrough of monetary policy, which has led to weaker inflation pressures. S&amp;P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year. They now expect UK GDP to rise by 0.6% this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.3%. Chief economist Paul Gruenwald says “the recovery in services in the first quarter has been stronger than expected” in the UK. However, the UK growth forecast in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Spain’s growth forecast has also been revised up, to 2.2% in 2024 from 1.8%. This is to reflect “robust household balance sheets and rapid disinflation”, Gruenwald explains. The global economy remain on track for a soft landing, as central banks start to lower interest rates followin recent falls in inflation. So says credit rating agency S&amp;P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&amp;P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a ‘soft landing’ – bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&amp;P Global argues that central banks have reached “the beginning of the end-game”, as some – such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank – have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&amp;P Global argues this is “just the flipside” of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want? Back in the UK retail sector, the former head of BHS is digesting a court ruling that he must pay at least £50m to cover losses racked up before its collapse. Yeterday, a judge found that Dominic Chappell had sought to “plunder” the UK department store chain, which collapsed in 2016. Mr Justice Leech said Chappell had agreed to purchase BHS without “any prospect” of obtaining working capital to meet its day-to-day financial needs. He then took the “opportunity to plunder the BHS Group as and when he could”, the judge explained. The Financial Times has more details: At a hearing on Tuesday, the judge said Chappell “should make the payments” set out in a draft order. A copy of the order, seen by the Financial Times, shows the sums include £21.5m for a wrongful trading claim, £17.5m for breach of fiduciary duty, plus costs and interest, totalling at least £50m. Back in 2020, Chappell was been sentenced to six years in jail for evading tax on the £2.2m income he received from his doomed takeover of BHS. Takeover drama is, ahem, swirling in the kitchen electricals sector, with a report that German engineering group Robert Bosch is weighing a bid for U.S. appliances manufacturer Whirlpool. According to Reuters, Bosch has been talking to potential advisers about the possibility of making an offer for Whirlpool, which has a market capitalisation of about $4.8bn. Whirlpool makes washing machines, driers, fridges, freezers, ovens, microwaves, cooktops, cooking hobs, hoods and dishwashers. The report has got Wall Street in a spin – shares in Whirlpool have jumped 18% in pre-market trading. Bloomberg points out that Glencore’s coal business has long been a source of controversy among climate activists and some investors. In an article about LGIM’s divestment plans, they explain: In 2020, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund said it had sold its Glencore stake due to the company’s exposure to thermal coal. Glencore plans to consult with shareholders on the future of the coal business once it completes the acquisition of Teck Resources Ltd.’s steelmaking coal unit. Should a majority of investors show support to spin off the unit, Glencore will hold a vote on separating it. More here. In the travel sector, US operator Southwest Airlines has cut its revenue guidance. Southwest Airlines now expects revenue per available seat mile to fall by up to 4.5% in the three months to June, down from a previous estimate of a decline of 1.5% to 3.5%. Southwest says it is adapting to lower prices in the current environment…. Heads-up: we have updated the 9.52am post to clarify that Legal &amp; General’s decision applies to funds in the Future World fund range, LGIM’s ESG fund ranges, and all the defined contribution auto-enrolment default funds in L&amp;G Workplace Pensions and the L&amp;G Mastertrust. Overall, those funds have around £176bn in assets under management. But LGIM is not divesting their entire position in Glencore. LGIM explains: Climate Impact Pledge divestments are used to signal not only to the companies, but the wider sector and market, that there has been insufficient progress made in mitigating climate change risks. LGIM continues to engage with companies on its divestment list and will take companies off the list when sufficient progress is made. Just in: UK retail sales have fallen faster than expected this month, as the sector went into reverse after May’s modest recovery. The CBI’s latest healthcheck on UK retailers, just released, found that retail sales volumes fell in the year to June, following a modest recovery in May. The CBI’s retail sales volume gauge fell to -24% this month, from +8% in May, showing that a majority of retailers reported a drop in volumes compared to the previous year. UK retailers also expect sales to be weaker than usual next month, following a drop in orders. The CBI explains: Sales were reported to be well below “average” for the time of year (-39% from +2% in May). Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%). Orders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: “Last month’s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it’s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England’s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it’s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK’s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.” Legal &amp; General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx. LGIM says TJX, like Glencore, failed to sufficiently address concerns raised in recent years about its environmental impact. LGIM says it concerned over TJX’s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of “material Scope 3 emissions” that fail to account for its material value chains’ emissions. Today’s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM’s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this “stewardship” of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.” LGIM took its decision to divest from Glencore after conducting its latest Climate Impact Pledge (CIP). This is LGIM’s annual engagement programme to raise market standards and encourage companies to play their part in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Michelle Scrimgeour, CEO of LGIM, says: “With the world recently experiencing its first annual average temperature overshoot of 1.5˚C, the message is clear: there is much more to do to mitigate climate change, and we need to act now. “I have been encouraged by progress over the last 12 months, with many of the companies with which we have engaged making significant strides in important areas. However, it is clear that the pace of the transition is neither smooth enough nor fast enough. It is not the role of the asset management industry alone to tackle climate change: this is a whole of system transition, the pace of which is influenced by global public policy, regulatory standards and the nature of energy demand. Radical collaboration is therefore key – to drive aligned action and decarbonisation on a global scale.” Investment management giant Legal &amp; General’s ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds, and some of its pension funds, are to divest from Glencore due to concerns over its coal production. LGIM warns this morning that it believes companies need to do more to play their part in efforts to mitigate climate change risks. UPDATE: It will divest Glencore shares held in its Future World fund range, LGIM’s ESG fund ranges, and all defined contribution (DC) auto-enrolment default funds in L&amp;G Workplace Pensions and the L&amp;G Mastertrust. The decision applies to funds covering around £176bn in assets under management. Glencore, which is the world’s biggest coal shipper, is “phasing down” its coal portfolio, as part of a plan to only achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century. That means some existing coalmines would run until 2050, despite concerns about the pollution caused by thermal coal. Legal &amp; General says: “LGIM remains concerned that Glencore has not disclosed plans for thermal coal production that are aligned with a net zero pathway.” LGIM are the 22nd largest Glencore investor overall, according to data from LSEG, with 0.44% of the company’s shares. De Beers has warned that the recovery in diamond demand will be “protracted”, after reporting a drop in diamond sales this morning. Rough diamond sales value for De Beers’ fifth sales cycle of 2024 (the month to 25 June) have dropped to $315m, compared with $456m a year ago. Sales were also lower than in the fourth sales cycle, from 18 April to 22 May, when they were worth $383m. Al Cook, CEO of De Beers, says: “The northern summer is generally a quieter period for rough diamond sales, and this was reflected in our cycle 5 sales. The recent annual JCK jewellery show in Las Vegas confirmed a resurgence in retailers’ interest in natural diamonds in the United States but ongoing economic growth challenges in China mean we continue to expect a protracted U-shaped recovery in demand.” De Beer’s owner, Anglo American, is planning to sell the diamond miner as part of a corporate overhaul, after it fought off a £34bn takeover approach from rival BHP Group. Doordash’s thwarted interest in Deliveroo may be just “the start”, say analysts at investment bank Jefferies. They argue that the large gap in valuations between US and European online food delivery companies will lead to more cross-border M&amp;A activity this year. Jefferies told clients: In this instance, the talks have failed. But such is the strength of the financial, industrial and strategic logic of a Deliveroo takeover, we would not be surprised to see similar such headlines to re-emerge in the short term. In our view, the key to unlocking a recommended offer from Deliveroo is understanding the sensibilities of the Founder CEO, Will Shu. This may only be the start. Jefferies point out that Doordash is valued at a higher multiple of its earnings than Deliveroo: Deliveroo trades on a 2025 EV / EBITDA of c.7.5x vs DoorDash on c.16.5x. Online electrical retailer AO World has posted a surge in profits this morning. AO, which sells televisions, computers and kitchen white goods over the internet, grew its operating profits by 192% in the year to 31 March. It reports that tumble dryers were one of the biggest sellers during the winter, as the UK experienced the 8th wettest winter on record TV sales are also booming this month, up 54% compared with June 2023, as football fans upgrade in time for Euro 2024 (although England fans may consider returning their tellies after last night’s efforts). AO World, like Deliveroo, has been something of a stock market disappointment. It floated at 285p a decade ago, but sank to just 50p by early 2020 – before the Covid-19 pandemic sparked a surge of demand, driving shares over £4. They’re trading at 117p, up 3.5% this morning. AO’s founder and chief executive, John Roberts, says: “We have made good progress on our profit performance in FY24, which is a testament to the success of our strategic pivot to focusing on profit and cash generation. “We are now a much simpler, more efficient business and are performing better than ever for customers, with excellent and sustainable unit economics. “Our focus now is on delivering profitable top line growth with an ambition for double digit revenue growth in FY25. Passengers flying with Aer Lingus could also face disruption, as pilots at the airline begin working to rule today. This means pilots will not operate outside of hours or accept changes to rosters, making it harder for Aer Lingus to operate a busy summer schedule The Irish Times reports: Pilots at Aer Lingus have started a work to rule which has disrupted the travel plans of tens of thousands of people over the coming days. Dublin Airport was calm on Wednesday morning after the industrial action began after midnight with few delays and no cancelled flights after the first wave of departures. The industrial action by members of the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association (Ialpa), which relates to pay, has already grounded 270 flights. However, the travel arrangements of many others who had planned to travel over the next week remain up in the air as a result of the dispute. Shares in Deliveroo have jumped over 4% at the start of trading in London, following overnight reports that US rival Doordash considered a takeover bid. They’ve gained 5.5p to 132p, meaning they’ve up 4% this year. In the transport world, British Airways has apologised to passengers after its baggage system at Heathrow Airport suffered a “temporary technical fault”. The disruption meant that many travellers on flights departing from the west London airport did not have their checked-in luggage put on the plane, while some of those on arriving flights faced long delays to retrieve their baggage. According to the PA news agency, the issue began yesterday afternoon and was resolved towards the end of the day. A British Airways spokesman said: “We’ve apologised to those customers who were unable to travel with their luggage due to a temporary technical fault that was outside of our control. “This issue has been resolved and we’ve brought in additional colleagues to support our teams in getting bags back to our customers as quickly as possible.” Heathrow says no other airline was affected: Several passengers have reported arriving at their destinations without their luggage: Daniel Křetínský’s takeover offer for Royal Mail will be lucrative for the City. Sky News report that advisers working on the deal are in line for a fee bonanza worth more than £130m. Banks which will share in the pot include Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, BNP Paribas and Citigroup, who are all named as providing advice for either Křetínský or for International Distribution Services. Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský’s bid to take control of Royal Mail is taking a step forwards today. Křetínský’s investment group has published the formal offer for International Distribution Services (IDS), Royal Mail’s parent company, online this morning, and send it by post. UPDATED: This means around 100,000 retail investors, including former and current Royal Mail staff, must decide whether to accept Křetínský’s £3.57bn takeover offer. Asset managers who also own a stake in IDS will have the same decision to make. Staff were given shares, totalling 10% of the company, when Royal Mail floated on the stock market a decade ago. Some will have sold since, but staff still hold around 5.5% of its equity (Křetínský is already the largest shareholder, with 27.5%). Křetínský is offering to pay 370p a share (360p cash plus 10p of dividends) for Royal Mail; a premium on the 220p-ish levels they traded at in April, before he made his first approach. Royal Mail shares closed at 315p last night, a sign that the City isn’t certain that Křetínský will succeed in his bid. He does have the support of IDS’s board, which agreed to various terms and conditions pegged to Křetínský’s latest offer a month ago. But, the deal will also be reviewed under the UK’s National Security and Investment Act. Earlier this month, business secretary Kemi Badenoch was pressed to question Křetínský on his business links, after the Guardian raised questions about a series of controversial global property deals connected to the Czech billionaire’s longtime business partners. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Deliveroo has become the latest UK company to catch the eye of an overseas suitor. According to Reuters, US meal delivery group Doordash flagged an interest in a takeover of Deliveroo last month. San Francisco-based Doordash approached Deliveroo, but talks are set to have floundered over a disagreement on valuation. There are no talks ongoing, one person close to the issue says. After booming in the pandemic, food delivery apps are now facing a tougher macroeconomic environment as the cost of living squeeze has hit customers. The Financial Times calculated a month ago that online food delivery groups in Europe and the US have racked up more than $20bn (£15.7bn) in combined operating losses since they floated on stock markets in recent years. That includes operating losses of $777m for Deliveroo since 2021 when it listed in London. Investors have not been terribly impressed. Deliveroo floated at 390p per share in April 2021, but was dubbed ‘Flopperoo’ after tumbling 26% on its first day. By October 2022 they had sunk to 73p, but have rallied back to around 127p last night. That values Deliveroo at just over £2bn, notably lower than its £7.6bn value when it floated. In March, Deliveroo forecast it would grow its sales (gross transaction value) by 5-9%, and achieve positive free cash flow this year; DoorDash, which is worth $45bn, may have seen a profitable opportunity in the UK….

        "content": "The sham of Australia’s climate change policy has been made clear in the past two weeks. No, not nuclear power. Last Friday, while everyone was racing down nuclear-powered rabbit holes, the environment department (led by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek) approved a coal seam gas pipeline in Queensland. This approval “has effect until 30 June 2069”. And on Tuesday the department approved the Atlas stage 3 gas project in Queensland out to June 2080. Those dates are rather beyond 2050 when we’re supposed to be at net zero emissions. They are also when temperatures will be well over 2C above the preindustrial average. If the graph does not display click here The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report suggests business as usual would lead to a 3.2C increase in temperature by 2100. This is roughly in line with the trend increase since the turn of the century. Joëlle Gergis in her Quarterly Essay Highway to Hell notes that under this scenario temperatures in Australia rise by as much a 4.4C. But that’s if things don’t get worse. Under a “high-emissions scenario”, temperatures by the end of this century are likely to rise between 3.2C and 5.6C. And a high-emissions scenario is one in which governments keep approving new gas and coalmines. This is the ghastly horror of the nuclear power debate. It’s a faux argument about what might happen in (let’s be generous) 25 years, rather than about what is happening today (or last Friday). The Aemo’s new integrated system plan also brings this to the fore. Australia needs more renewables to reduce our emissions now and replace coal-fire powered stations. And reducing emissions now is critical, because this is the current picture: If the graph does not display click here Since 2005 Australia’s emissions have fallen only 2.5%. But if the trend since 2020 continues to 2069, emissions would only be 9% below 2005 levels. Not quite net zero. The government likes to say emissions are down 29% but that’s just spin for the gullible. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The 29% includes land use, which means we get credit for not cutting down as many trees as we did in 2005. It’s dodgy accounting that doesn’t honestly measure changes in emissions: If the graph does not display click here But you might think we need more gas, because we are about to run out. Sorry, no. The reality that needs to be tattooed on everyone’s eyeballs is that Australia has more than enough gas. The latest gas statement of opportunities report notes that about 72% of Australia’s gas heads overseas – including about 23 megatons from Gladstone in 2023. If the graph does not display click here The gas industry argues we can’t count that as Australia’s gas. Last year the chief executive of the gas lobby group Australia Energy Producers, Samantha McCulloch, told a Senate committee that the gas “wouldn’t have been produced without that export market there”. Remember the actual conversion of gas to liquefied natural gas uses more of Australia’s gas than does all Australian manufacturing or do all households in Australia: If the graph does not display click here And a new gas pipeline (even if it is for gas that ends up being used domestically) will not make gas cheaper. As I wrote a decade ago, now that we’re connected to the world market, domestic supply makes no difference to prices. By contrast, Aemo notes that “lower cost, lower emission renewables will offer homes and businesses the electricity they need, with greater insulation from international price shocks”. You might think this is just greedy companies taking us for fools. But no, the government is very much along for the ride. The “future gas strategy” released by the resources minister, Madeleine King, in the week before the budget made it clear that the government was committed to more gas. Not so much for us as for others, including Japan. To justify this the government has come up with a nonsensical line that gas exports are crucial for national security because Japan needs them and it would otherwise become reliant upon Russia. Except Japan sells on more gas to other countries than it imports from Australia. Yes, more! The Australian Financial Review, bless its corporate soul, argues that this demonstrates just how vital LNG exports are for security because “Japan is using Australian LNG to pursue regional strategic energy security”. Please. At this point you also have to ask: is it really “Australian LNG”? Australian governments don’t charge royalties for gas drilled offshore, so we give it away for free and they end up paying bugger all petroleum resources rent tax. And if it is drilled onshore the government excludes it from being subject to the PRRT. It’s a sweet deal for gas companies – they have got us coming and going. And who is doing this exporting? Not “Australia”. For example, Inpex is a Japanese company that operates the Ichthys LNG gas field off Australia’s north-west coast. It pays no royalties for the gas it extracts. It exports all of it to Japan, where it can then be sold on to other nations. Taxation? Pfft. The Ichthys LNG gas field was projected to never have to pay any PRRT. Ever get the feeling you’ve been cheated? Far from being outraged, the government seems to like being conned – it even spruiks for the companies. Last year the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, berated the opposition and the Greens in the Senate for voting against a massive expansion of the gas industry: “You know what you’ve been doing? You said no to Santos. You then said no to Woodside. You’ve said no to Inpex.” At least we know who the government cares about. But with the Coalition now calling for nuclear power and throwing around laughable concept art of reactors that will never be, the government can look good by comparison. It is free to ensure fossil fuels are released with excess abandon, with little media scrutiny and with less recompense to the Australian citizens who own the gas and will suffer greatly from the climate change caused by their emissions. And on that score let me leave you with one final thought – for the first time each of the past 12 months set records for the hottest individual months: If the graph does not display click here Yes, it is important to think about policies that will be in place in 2050 and to govern for the future. But we need to govern for right now, because now we are producing the emissions that will destroy our future. Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work",

        "title": "Union calls for Royal Mail staff to get ‘serious stake’ in service after takeover",
        "content": "The union representing postal workers has called for them to be handed a serious stake in Royal Mail, after the Czech billionaire bidding to snap up its owner for £3.6bn floated the possibility of implementing an “incentive scheme” if he is successful. Daniel Křetínský’s EP Group published an offer document on Wednesday laying out the details of its bid for Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS). It also wrote to 100,000 shareholders, who include current and former staff and who collectively own more than 5% of the company’s shares, asking them to sell, in a move that would help pave the way for the takeover. Last month, the sale of IDS edged closer after its board accepted the £3.57bn offer from EP UK Bidco, a newly formed venture between EP Group and its longstanding partner J&amp;T Capital Partners. In Wednesday’s offer document, EP UK Bidco said it was “exploring, following completion of the acquisition, potentially offering a form of employee participation model in the business”. It said a “profit sharing mechanism” for employees was under consideration but stopped short of committing to a specific scheme. It added that “no decision has been made in respect of the terms of, or timing for implementation of, such incentive scheme”. However, a spokesperson for the Communication Workers Union, which represents postal workers, said: “We’re looking for a serious stake in the company but also a serious voice in the running of the company. “We’re not interested in profit payouts that are at the mercy of a board – we want workers’ influence at all levels. Not just the main board, but the remuneration committee, the recruitment committees – to make sure we don’t recruit people who don’t have the interest of postal workers at heart.” EP has committed to a number of undertakings and contractual commitments as part of its offer, including maintaining the delivery of first-class post six days a week, and keeping the business headquartered in the UK for five years. Křetínský, who made his fortune in energy and owns a minority stake in one of the main gas pipelines from Russia into Europe, also supports a Royal Mail plan to cut deliveries of second-class post to every other weekday. In his proposed deal, the billionaire would pay 360p a share for the 73% of the struggling postal service he does not already own, with investors also getting 10p in dividends for each share. Křetínský, nicknamed the “Czech Sphinx” for his reluctance to speak publicly, must now persuade three-quarters of shareholders to back the deal. While thousands of postal workers were handed shares in Royal Mail when it was privatised in 2013 for £3.3bn, the majority of remaining shares are owned by big investors, including asset managers such as BlackRock, UBS and Schroders. IDS shares edged down to 314p on Wednesday, in a sign that the City was unconvinced that the bid would succeed. In theory, the next government could “call in” the takeover for scrutiny and prevent it, if it were deemed to be against the UK’s national security interests. However, Labour has not opposed the takeover in principle, saying it welcomes the assurances given by Křetínský and would ensure he stuck to them if, as polls suggest, it wins next week’s election. The EP offer could be worth up to £3m to Royal Mail’s current and former directors, while postal staff who held on to the shares they were given during the 2013 privatisation could get a near-£3,400 windfall. The offer document also detailed EP’s relationship with J&amp;T Partners, a Czech private investment firm ultimately controlled by a private equity group. A Guardian investigation this month raised questions about a series of controversial global property deals connected to Křetínský’s longtime business partners, including J&amp;T founder Patrik Tkáč. If the deal completes, EP will own just over 56% of IDS and J&amp;T just under 44%. In the offer document, the bidders said: “J&amp;T has been a long-term business partner of EP and its founder and controlling shareholder, Daniel Křetínský. “Consistent with the approach taken for other investments in which both EP and J&amp;T have participated, J&amp;T is in the position of a financial investor; it has no co-management role and has no joint control in relation to Bidco.” Bankers and other advisers at City institutions including Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan will share in a windfall of up to £146m if the takeover is completed.",

        "content": "The movies group Universal has said a Hollywood theme park it plans to build in Bedfordshire, England, will be open 365 days a year and will boost the UK economy by nearly £50bn. Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences, which is owned by the US telecoms group Comcast, the parent company of Sky, plans to build on a 192-hectare site (476 acres) in Kempston Hardwick near Bedford. The company has an option to buy a further 25 hectares. The theme park is expected to attract millions of visitors a year and would include a 500-room hotel and a dining area open to those without a theme park ticket. The park’s experiences would include rides, shows and areas “based on the most popular films, video games and stories that people have enjoyed for decades”. Universal’s existing theme parks around the world feature Nintendo, Harry Potter and Shrek. Construction is forecast to create 20,000 jobs and once open create 8,000 jobs initially, with more jobs likely over time, according to Universal. The company has pledged to pay the living wage to employees. An analysis by Universal, produced in line with Treasury guidelines on economic appraisal, estimates the resort would bring in nearly £50bn of economic benefits to the UK. The net economic contribution is forecast to be £35.1bn during construction and the first 20 years of operation. It would generate up to £14.1bn in additional tax returns over the same period, the study said. Universal is still conducting due diligence and expects to decide on the project by the end of the year. The new park, which would take five to six years to build, would be constructed on the site of Kempston Hardwick brickworks, once the world’s largest brickworks, which shut in 2008 and was demolished in September 2021. The company said 92% of 6,000 people surveyed during a four-week public engagement period in May supported the theme park. It said it had “been delighted by the enthusiasm and overwhelmingly positive responses provided throughout the public engagement period”. Page Thompson, Universal’s president in charge of new ventures, said: “A world-class theme park and resort from Universal has the potential to generate billions in economic benefit for the UK, by creating thousands of high-quality jobs and attracting millions of new visitors to the country.” He told Sky News: “We’ve spent the last decade looking all over Europe and the United Kingdom for locations, and we think this is the best location we’ve ever seen.” At the moment, Universal has five theme parks around the world: US parks in Hollywood, California, and at Orlando in Florida; as well as sites in Japan, China and Singapore. Disneyland Paris, together with the associated Walt Disney Studios Park, is Europe’s biggest theme park, and attracts nearly 15 million visitors a year.",

        "content": "The British arm of Atos, the French technology company that is a vital supplier of the NHS and UK government departments, is facing a “material uncertainty” over its ability to continue as a going concern, auditors have warned. In the latest accounts for its UK holding company covering 2022, the company’s auditor, Grant Thornton, said financial problems facing its parent company in France could limit the UK arm’s ability to access cash and continue as a going concern. In April, Atos UK’s parent company revealed total debt of nearly €5bn, and was looking at financial restructuring offers to stabilise its finances. The auditors’ findings, first reported by The Times, also warned that if the parent company failed to successfully meet or renegotiate loans or sell assets, the UK arm could face being unable to settle its own liabilities. Atos is one of the UK government’s 40 strategic suppliers, a group of selected contractors that hold billions of pounds worth of contracts with government departments. According to researchers at the data firm Tussell, Atos has almost £1bn of revenue coming from 43 contracts, including providing IT systems to the NHS, the Ministry of Defence, and the Department for Work and Pensions. However, the government has been monitoring Atos’s financial problems and the i newspaper has reported that the government has drawn up contingency plans to maintain public services if Atos is not able to meet requirements. They reportedly include lining up other potential IT providers if Atos is unable to run these services. The struggling French IT firm has faced a turbulent few years as it has attempted to tackle its growing debt pile. During that period, shares in the company have dropped 97% in value, while it has also had four chief executives in two years. Included in its fundraising plan it has tried to sell parts of the business, with the French government offering €700m to buy important assets from its security and data divisions this month. The company is also attempting to strike a rescue deal that would restructure its debt. On Wednesday, it revealed it had received a new restructuring deal from a committee of bondholders after discussions with a consortium of investors, led by David Layani’s Onepoint, broke down. In the 2022 accounts, which were written before the recent restructuring proposals, Grant Thornton said the wider difficulties and uncertainty about the company’s restructuring meant for its UK arm, a “material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern”. A spokesperson for Atos said: “Atos is currently undergoing a financial restructuring, which will create a stable financial future globally and in the UK. “The provision of services to our customers has remained unaffected and we will continue providing high-quality services to the UK public and private sectors, as we have for over 30 years.”",

        "title": "TV sales for Euro 2024 help triple profits at retailer AO World",
        "content": "The online electrical goods seller AO World has enjoyed a near-tripling of profits thanks in part to booming tumble dryer sales during the wet winter and televisions for Euro 2024. Revenues at the retailer, which sells 15% of all domestic appliances in the UK, were also bolstered by the continued popularity of air fryers, with the company attributing this to customers looking for a cheaper alternative to takeaways amid the cost of living crisis. Pre-tax profits at the company rose to £34.3m in the year to 31 March, marking a 186% rise compared with £12m posted in 2023. In its update on Wednesday, it said tumble dryers were among its biggest sellers during the winter because of the heavy rain. According to the Met Office, the UK experienced its eighth wettest winter on record, with rainfall 29% higher than average. It also said the Euro 2024 men’s football tournament had prompted a jump in the number of customers upgrading their TVs, with sales this month 54% higher than the previous year. There was also growing demand for more energy-efficient products and sales of A-rated cooking appliances and heat pump tumble dryers increased significantly. The strong annual results mark a turnaround from two years ago when AO profits fell to £8m, down from £64m posted a year before. The business blamed declining sales and customers cancelling warranties on products to save money during the cost of living crisis. In Wednesday’s update, AO said there had been a reduction in cancellation rates of product protection plans, which had improved its profitability. The increase in profits came despite the company’s turnover falling by 9% to just over £1bn for the year. AO said this was a result of the company pivoting to focus on profit and cash generation and controlling overheads. However, AO’s mobile arm, Mobile Phones Direct, continued to struggle, with new contracts down by 14% on last year. It said a suppressed market and greater competition for customers had led to it offering “unsustainable discounts to win market share”. John Roberts, AO’s founder and chief executive, said: “We have made good progress on our profit performance … which is a testament to the success of our strategic pivot to focusing on profit and cash generation. “We are now a much simpler, more efficient business and are performing better than ever for customers, with excellent and sustainable unit economics. “Our focus now is on delivering profitable top-line growth with an ambition for double-digit revenue growth in FY25.”",

        "title": "Two US astronauts stuck in space as Boeing analyzes Starliner problems",
        "content": "Boeing’s public relations crisis is now out of this world: the company’s Starliner spacecraft – with two astronauts onboard – are currently stuck in space. After what started as an eight-day mission, US astronauts Sunita “Suni” Williams and Barry “Butch” Wilmore have now spent the better part of a month in the International Space Station as engineers work out the problems with Starliner. It remains unclear when exactly the astronauts will be able to make their return to Earth. A Boeing spokesperson said they have “adjusted the return of Starliner crew flight test until after two planned spacewalks on Monday 24 June and Tuesday 2 July” and that they “currently do not have a date for the return, and will evaluate opportunities after the spacewalks”. The spokesperson also noted “the crew is not pressed for time to leave the station since there are plenty of supplies in orbit, and the station’s schedule is relatively open through mid-August”. The Starliner blasted into space on 5 June from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station after two previously unsuccessful launches on 6 May and 1 June respectively. A year behind schedule and $1.5bn over budget, this particular Nasa-Boeing mission had problems long before its official launch, including issues with reaction control thrusters and helium leaks. The Boeing spokesperson noted that the helium leaks and most of the thruster problems have been “all stable and not a concern for the return mission. “Four of the five thrusters that were previously shutting down are now operating normally. This means only one thruster out of 27 is currently offline. This does not present an issue for the return mission,” the spokesperson added. Nasa and Boeing officials insist the astronauts are not stranded and that the technical difficulties do not threaten the mission. Nasa said the spacecraft requires seven hours of free-flight time to perform a normal end of mission and it “currently has enough helium left in its tanks to support 70 hours of free flight activity following undocking”. Steve Stich, Nasa’s commercial crew program manager, said in a press briefing last week: “We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process. We are letting the data drive our decision making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking.” The spacecraft is cleared to undock and return to Earth if there’s an emergency or need for a quick departure. “While Starliner is docked, all the manifolds are closed per normal mission operations preventing helium loss from the tanks,” Nasa said. If the Starliner is not safely operational, it’s possible Williams and Wilmore will have to catch a ride with the crew on SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, which is also currently attached to the International Space Station on the opposite side. Boeing’s latest crisis comes on the heels of other public crises they’ve had with various commercial aircraft, though the company insists they operate separately. The Starliner launch is only the sixth inaugural journey of a crewed spacecraft in US history, Nasa administrator Bill Nelson said in a May news conference. “It started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then [SpaceX’s] Dragon – and now Starliner,” Nelson said. • This article was amended on 26 June 2024.

        "content": "Australia’s monthly inflation rate increased to its highest level in 2024 in the latest indication that the Reserve Bank won’t be cutting interest rates soon and might yet hike again. Consumer prices rose 4% last month from a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That compared with the 3.6% pace recorded for April, and the 3.8% rate expected for May by economists. The jump in May’s inflation was propelled in part by automotive fuel prices, which were up 9.3% from a year earlier even as they retreated 5.1% during the month itself. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Electricity prices were also up 6.5% from a year ago, quickening from April’s 4.2% pace. Without the federal and state rebates, power prices would have been 14.5% higher. Food presented a mixed price picture. Overall prices were up 3.3% from May 2023, a slowdown from April’s 3.8% pace. Fruit and vegetable prices, though, climbed 4.4% compared with May 2023, continuing a recent rebound after prices posted a 1.2% drop in March. Housing costs were 5.2% higher than in May 2023, with rents up 7.4%, reflecting the low vacancy rates in many cities. Of particular concern will be the acceleration of the trimmed mean measure of inflation, which is what the RBA looks at more closely than the “headline” CPI figure. That jumped to 4.4% from 4.1% in April and 4% in March. The monthly inflation figures are less complete than the quarterly ones, which won’t land until 31 July. The RBA expects the quarterly inflation pace will accelerate to 3.8% in the April-June period from 3.6% in the March quarter. The monthly consumer price index peaked in December 2022 at 8.4%, a three-decade high, as post-Covid government stimulus combined with higher global energy prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Urkaine. The RBA has said it won’t hesitate to raise its key interest rate – for a 14th time in this cycle – if it loses confidence that inflation can fall back within its 2%-3% target by the end of next year. The federal budget, released earlier this month, forecast price increases could slow to 3% or less by the end of 2024. It is banking on energy rebates and other measures to “mechanically” lower the CPI even as the stage-three cuts inject more than $20bn into the economy this coming financial year. The Australian dollar jumped about US0.2 cents to almost US66.7 in the wake of the inflation figures as investors shifted their bets about interest rates. Stocks also shed about 0.3 percentage points, before paring the losses to be down about 0.75% for the day. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said inflation was “higher than we would like”, and much lower than 6.1% when Labor took office in May 2022. “We’ve seen around the world that inflation can zig and zag on its way down, it doesn’t always moderate in a straight line and the last mile can be a bit harder,” Chalmers said. His shadow counterpart Angus Taylor said the inflation outcome was “shocking but not surprising”. “This is what happens when you have a big spending Labor government that’s completely out of touch with the economic reality,” Taylor said. “We’ve now had four months in a row of accelerating core inflation. This will no doubt be of concern to the independent Reserve Bank.” However, Steve Mickenbecker, an executive with Canstar, said the monthly inflation pop was “staggering”, confirming that inflation was not on the downward trajectory sought by the RBA. The RBA will “surely lift rates” when its board meets in on 5-6 August because “the risk of baked-in inflationary expectations is too high”, Mickenbecker said. “It’s worrying news for borrowers with an increase of 0.25 [percentage point] adding $100 to the monthly repayment on a $600,000 loan over 30 years,” he said. “Even without a rate increase, a three-month extension before a rate cut adds $288 in extra repayments to the same loan.” David Bassanese, chief economist with Betashares, said the monthly CPI was a “shocker” that placed “huge pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates in August”. “For the RBA, the concern remains that the longer inflation stays high, the greater the risk of it becoming embedded into inflation expectations and ongoing wage and price setting behaviour – particularly given the economy, despite weak growth, is still operating at a high level of capacity,” Bassanese said. Prior to today’s figures all of the big four commercial banks – save ANZ – were forecasting the RBA would cut its cash rate in November. ANZ earlier this month broke ranks to predict the first rate cut wouldn’t happen until February 2025.",

        "title": "Rivian shares surge after Volkswagen agrees to $5bn investment",
        "content": "Shares in Rivian surged after Volkswagen agreed to invest up to $5bn in the Amazon-backed electric carmaker. Volkswagen will initially invest $1bn as part of a partnership with Rivian to form a new, equally controlled joint venture to share electric vehicle architecture and software, the companies said on Tuesday. On Wall Street, shares in Rivian’s stock jumped 33% when trading began on Wednesday following the announcement. The deal amounts to a significant win for Rivian, which is grappling with steep losses as it attempts to ramp up production of its electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. While EV startups have been dealing with a slowdown in demand amid high interest rates and dwindling cash, traditional automakers have struggled to build battery-powered vehicles and advanced software. The partnership between Rivian and Volkswagen will help Volkswagen accelerate its plans to develop software-defined vehicles (SDV), with Rivian licensing its existing intellectual property rights to the joint venture. The investment will provide Rivian – known for its flagship R1S SUVs and R1T pickups – the funding it needs to develop its less-expensive and smaller R2 SUVs that will roll out in 2026, the founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe, told Reuters. Scaringe said the investment was “expected to help secure our capital needs for substantial growth”. “Since the earliest days of Rivian, we have been focused on developing highly differentiated technology, and it’s exciting that one of the world’s largest and most respected automotive companies has recognized this,” Scaringe added. Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen Group, said: “Through our cooperation, we will bring the best solutions to our vehicles faster and at lower cost … We are strengthening our technology profile and our competitiveness.” Reuters contributed reporting",

        "title": "Nvidia shares open higher after $500bn sell-off; Microsoft hit with EU antitrust charge over Teams – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up…. Shares in Nvidia have jumped 3% in early trading, as the AI chipmaker recovers some ground after three days of big losses. Today’s rally lifts Nvidia’s value by around $90bn, back to almost $3trn. Over half a trillion dollars had been knocked off Nvidia’s value in recent days, before today’s tentative recovery, shortly after it became the world’s largest company last week. Brussels has accused Microsoft of anti-competitive behaviour by bundling its Teams app with its Office suite, potentially teeing up a large fine for the software giant: US consumer morale has dropped this month, a new survey shows, but was stronger than expected. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dipped in June to 100.4, down from 101.3 in May. Economists had expected it would fall more, to exactly 100. The decline was due to a deteriorating short-term outlook for income, business, and conditions in the jobs market. Dana M. Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, explains: “Confidence pulled back in June but remained within the same narrow range that’s held throughout the past two years, as strength in current labor market views continued to outweigh concerns about the future. However, if material weaknesses in the labor market appear, Confidence could weaken as the year progresses.” Microsoft’s stock is shrugging off today’s accusations from Brussels that it broke EU competition rules by bundling its Teams app with its Office suit. Shares in Microsoft are up 0.1% in morning trading in New York, at $448.15. Nvidia’s recovery is helping to lift the tech sector. The Nasdaq Composite index has gained 95 points, or 0.56%, to 17,592 points The broader S&amp;P 500 index is up 0.2%, with Nvidia the fourth highest riser. Cruise operator Carnival is leading the charge, after lifting its annual profit forecast today. The Dow Jones industrial average, of 30 large US companies, has dipped by 0.27% to 39,304 points, with Apple (+0.9%), Amazon (+0.7%) and Salesforce (+0.9%) among the risers. Ding Ding goes the Wall Street opening bell….. and Nvidia shares have opened higher. Nvidia has jumped 2.8% in early trading, to $121.46, up from $118 last night, after losing over $500bn in a dramatic tumble over the last three sesssions. As flagged this morning, technical analysts had indicated that Nvidia’s shares could have support at $115. They hit an alltime high of $140 last week, when Nvidia surged to become the world’s most valuable company, before starting to lose ground on Thursday. HSBC and Barclays are cutting rates on their fixed mortgage deals in what some brokers claim could be the start of a “summer of savings” for homebuyers and those looking to remortgage. Barclays has reduced rates by more than 0.25 percentage points in some cases from Tuesday, and its cuts led to a quick response from HSBC, which said it would be cutting rates across its home loans range with effect from Wednesday. While new home loan rates have been broadly stable over the last month or two, the pricing of some deals has crept up. However, recent improvements to money market swap rates – which largely determine the pricing of new fixed deals – appear to have prompted two of the biggest mortgage lenders to reduce their rates, with others predicted to follow suit. More here: With less than 30 minutes to go until Wall Street opens, Nvidia is still on track for a small recovery. Shares in Nvidia are on track to open almost 3% higher, at $121.60, which would recover nearly half of Monday’s losses. Over in Canada, inflation has jumped unexpectedly. Consumer prices across the Canadian economy rose by 2.9% in the year to May, up from 2.7% in April, dashing hopes of a small fall. This may be slightly awkward for the Bank of Canada, which cut interest rates earlier this month. Statistics Canada said the increase was due to higher prices for services, which rose 4.6% in May following a 4.2% increase in April. Faster price growth for services was led by cellular services, travel tours, rent and air transportation. Prices for goods (+1.0%) grew at the same rate as in April. Human rights organisation Amnesty International has hit out at plans for China’s fast fashion group Shein to float on the London Stock Exchange. It emerged yesterday that Shein has confidentially filed for a public listing in London, which could value the company at around £50bn. This would be London’s biggest ever float. But Dominique Muller, Amnesty International researcher specialising in the garment industry, says the City should demand transparent and binding safeguards regarding human rights standards, before admitting Shein to the fold: “It’s deeply troubling that a company with questionable labour and human rights standards and an unsustainable fast fashion business model could be set to reap hundreds of millions of pounds via a sale of shares and a listing on the London Stock Exchange. “Where SHEIN goes, others will try to follow. The UK authorities and the London Stock Exchange should not facilitate SHEIN’s listing until transparent and binding safeguards regarding internationally accepted human rights standards covering its entire supply chain are agreed and applied, and any abuses identified fully remedied. “Rewarding SHEIN’s current methods via a flotation would be a badge of shame for the London Stock Exchange, the bankers helping bring it to market, and any investors set to profit from it. It would be an appalling example of a process which delivers for the rich by squeezing the poor. It validates the view that it is acceptable to regard workers and their rights, company products and the environment as expendable – which cheapens us all. “It is essential the new UK government does not allow a race to the bottom in terms of corporate and human rights standards. It should require companies to prevent serious environmental harms and human rights abuses occurring throughout their entire operations and supply chains. It should enable workers whose rights are abused by company activities anywhere in the world recourse to justice through UK courts.” Shein has been accused of using forced labour to make its affordable clothing, such as t-shirts and sweaters. The Mail on Sunday reported last weekend that Shein may scrap its London float plans, amid growing disquiet in Beijing over the way the fast-fashion retailer is portrayed in the UK. A US central bank policymaker has indicated she would be open to raising interest rates if inflation not fall as hoped. In a speech in London today, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman also said the time is not right yet to start lowering borrowing costs. Bowman explained: Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2% goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Last month, US consumer price inflation fell to an annual rate of 3.3%, down from 3.4% in April. The owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands has warned its car plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton could close unless market demand for electric vehicles and “stupid” regulatory conditions change. The UK managing director of Stellantis said the company did not want to shut operations in the UK but it would make a decision in “less than a year” in the face of unreasonable government sales quotas and lack of consumer incentives in relation to VAT on vehicles and electricity. Maria Grazia Davino said today: “You have to make strategies that are based on efficiency. I want to keep the production [in the] UK and I want to be clear on this.” She added that the demand for electric vehicles was “soft” and unless there were further incentives for businesses to buy the electric commercial vehicles or more support from the government it may have no choice. Burrito chain Tortilla has bought its biggest European competitor in a deal worth nearly £4m, PA Media reports, as it hopes to attract new consumers on the go, ahead of the Paris Olympics. Tortilla is buying 13 restaurants from rival Fresh Burritos, in prime locations in Paris and other cities in France. The acquisition also includes a network of 19 franchised locations and the rights to the brand. The London-based company, which has 89 stores, predominantly in the UK, said the purchase will give it a “launchpad” to expand further into Europe. It says: “Tortilla’s international ambitions are no secret, and acquiring Fresh Burritos is our gateway to mainland Europe. “With Mexican cuisine surging in popularity, these prime French locations give us a solid launchpad.” Tesla is recalling more than 11,000 Cybertruck electric vehicles, due to problems with the windscreen wiper motor and the trunk bed trim seal, Marketwatch reports: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration acknowledged Tesla’s TSLA notification of both matters in letters dated Monday. The wiper issue potentially impacts 11,688 2024 Cybertruck units, while the trunk-bed trim issue could affect 11,383 units of the 2024 model. The recalls are the latest setback for the vehicle whose mass production is expected to start next year, points out Reuters: Microsoft president Brad Smith has responded to the EC’s statement of objections about Teams bundling, saying: “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission’s remaining concerns.” Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of EC competition policy, says: We are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses. And preserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets. If confirmed, Microsoft’s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules. Microsoft now has the opportunity to reply to our concerns. Microsoft faces a hefty antitrust fine if the EC’s charges over Teams bundling are upheld, points out Reuters. It risks a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual turnover if it is found guilty of the antitrust breaches announced today. Reuters adds: Two decades after Microsoft’s last EU fine, the EU competition watchdog’s latest action was triggered by a 2020 complaint from rival workspace messaging app Slack, owned by Salesforce. The U.S. tech giant had to pay €2.2bn ($2.4 billion) in EU antitrust fines two decades ago for tying, or bundling, two or more products together. Big tech news from Brussels: Microsoft has been accused of anti-competitive behaviour by the European Commission for bundling its Teams app with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites. The EC says it is concerned that, since at least April 2019, Microsoft has been tying Teams with its core software-as-a-service (SaaS) productivity applications. This, it fears, has restricted competition on the market for communication and collaboration products and defending its market position in productivity software and its suites-centric model from competing suppliers of individual software. The Commission explains: In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications. This advantage may have been further exacerbated by interoperability limitations between Teams‘ competitors and Microsoft’s offerings. The conduct may have prevented Teams’ rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area. If confirmed, these practices would infringe Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’), which prohibits the abuse of a dominant market position. Today’s Statement of Objections comes almost a year after the EC launched an antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s bundling of its Teams video and chat app with some of its other products. The Commission says that after it began its investigation, Microsoft introduced changes in the way it distributes Teams, and started offering some suites without Teams. However, the Commission has preliminarily found that these changes are insufficient to address its concerns and that “more changes to Microsoft’s conduct are necessary to restore competition”. Whoever wins next week’s general election will benefit from an improving economic climate, predicts Capital Economics. They predict that interest rates will fall faster than forecast over the next 18 months, while economic growth will be pacier. Capital Economics say: The next government, which the polls ahead of the election on 4th July suggest will be a Labour one, will benefit from a combination of lower inflation, lower interest rates and faster economic growth than most are expecting. We think that a fall in CPI inflation from 2.0% in May to around 1.5% by the end of this year will prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates from 5.25% to 3.00% next year, rather than to 4.00% as investors expect. And the boost to activity from lower inflation and interest rates explains why we are more optimistic than most by expecting the economy to grow by 1.0% this year and 1.5% in both 2025 and 2026. While tax revenues and public spending may both be a bit higher under a Labour government, the economy will probably tread a similar path over the next couple of years. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, explained last weekend that the economy Labour will (probably) take on is not quite as ravaged as some suggest…. The use of artificial intelligence to revolutionise scientific research and disease understanding is one of the top ten emerging technologies of this year. So says the World Economic Forum, in a new report that highlights groundbreaking innovations that can tackle critical global challenges within the next 3 to 5 years. WEF’s Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2024 are: AI for scientific discovery: While artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in research for many years, advances in deep learning, generative AI and foundation models are revolutionizing the scientific discovery process. AI will enable researchers to make unprecedented connections and advancements in understanding diseases, proposing new materials, and enhancing knowledge of the human body and mind. Privacy-enhancing technologies: Protecting personal privacy while providing new opportunities for global data sharing and collaboration, “synthetic data” is set to transform how information is handled with powerful applications in health-related research. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces: These innovative surfaces turn ordinary walls and surfaces into intelligent components for wireless communication while enhancing energy efficiency in wireless networks. They hold promise for numerous applications, from smart factories to vehicular networks. High-altitude platform stations: Using aircraft, blimps and balloons, these systems can extend mobile network access to remote regions, helping bridge the digital divide for over 2.6 billion people worldwide. Integrated sensing and communication: The advent of 6G networks facilitates simultaneous data collection (sensing) and transmission (communication). This enables environmental monitoring systems that help in smart agriculture, environmental conservation and urban planning. Integrated sensing and communication devices also promise to reduce energy and silicon consumption. Immersive technology for the built world: Combining computing power with virtual and augmented reality, these technologies promise rapid improvements in infrastructure and daily systems. This technology allows designers and construction professionals to check for correspondence between physical and digital models, ensuring accuracy and safety and advancing sustainability. Elastocalorics: As global temperatures rise, the need for cooling solutions is set to soar. Offering higher efficiency and lower energy use, elastocalorics release and absorb heat under mechanical stress, presenting a sustainable alternative to current technologies. Carbon-capturing microbes: Engineered organisms convert emissions into valuable products like biofuels, providing a promising approach to mitigating climate change. Alternative livestock feeds: protein feeds for livestock sourced from single-cell proteins, algae and food waste could offer a sustainable solution for the agricultural industry. Genomics for transplants: The successful implantation of genetically engineered organs into a human marks a significant advancement in healthcare, offering hope to millions awaiting transplants. Here’s the full report. Most Nvidia shareholders will still be in profit despite the 16% drop over the last few days (as it is up 2,700% over the last five years!). Neil Roarty, analyst at investment platform Stocklytics, says: “A week ago Nvidia was celebrating becoming the most valuable company in the world; now it’s licking its wounds on what some are describing as the biggest bloodbath in investor history, with more than half a trillion dollars wiped off in a matter of days. “Even against this backdrop, there may still be reasons for optimism. The surge in Nvidia share price has been so remarkable throughout 2024 that most investors are still in the black. Indeed, profit-taking looks to be a key factor for the adjustment; even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been selling stock. “The fundamentals behind Nvidia’s growth remain the same. If you believe that the AI technology its chips are powering will completely recalibrate the global economy - and many do - then a $3 trillion market cap suddenly looks considerably more reasonable.” Banking news: the UK government’s stake in NatWest has dipped below 21%. Due to sales as part of the ongoing trading plan, the government reduced its shareholding in NatWest to 20.92%, it has told the City. Back in April 2023, the stake was 42%, down from around 84% at its peak, but has been whittled down as the government returned shares to the markets. Plans for a sale of the government’s stake in NatWest to the general public have been disrupted by the general election, but that hasn’t stopped the shareholding being steadily trimmed…. In the UK retail sector, supermarket chain Morrisons has reported a pick-up in sales. Morrisons’ like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, rose 4.1% in the three months from 29 January to 28 April. Total sales (ex-fuel) jumped 3.7% to £3.8bn. Jo Goff, chief financial officer, says: “This has been another solid quarter of progress with sales and volume improvements right across the business. Our debt has now reduced by over a third and we made further progress on our cost savings programme with £78m delivered in the quarter, taking the total since the start of this year to just over £450m, in line with our £700 million three year target.” Last year, Morrisons made a loss of more than £1bn after a debt-fuelled private equity takeover in 2021. Back in the future’s market…. Nvidia’s shares price is now rallying! It’s currently up 2.5% in pre-market trading, at $121, having initially been on track for a 2% fall. Wall Street opens at 2.30pm UK time (or 9.30am in New York), so we’ll see if it can hang onto these gains….. Nvidia’s stonking share price rise over the last couple of years was partly driven by fear of missing out, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. This phenomenon can work in reverse too, Mould points out: “Admittedly, a near-7% decline in Nvidia. [yesterday] might have sounded the alarm bells that we’re seeing a shift in the market. It’s important to remember that stocks don’t always travel in a straight line and there is a herd mentality with big-name companies on the market. “When everyone was piling into Nvidia, it created a sense of FOMO – fear of missing out – so others followed suit and bid up the shares even further. The same works in reverse, where a bout of selling can be exacerbated by others following the crowd and panicking. “Quite a few institutional investors have been suggesting in recent months that US markets were looking a bit toppy. When everything is racing ahead it is time to take a hard look at a portfolio and think about what could go wrong as well as what could go right. The higher the big tech stocks rise, the greater the potential fall if markets turn. Nvidia’s selloff over the last few days has not, yet, spooked the wider markets. Derren Nathan, equity research analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: “Nvidia has had another stumble slipping further away from the position it held briefly as the world’s most valuable company. But contrary to recent noise, markets are about more than just one stock. After several days of declines, yesterday saw the chipmaker’s stock lose over 6%, shedding some $200bn from its market value. But to put things in context, the shares have still gained 190% on a 12-month view, so it’s no surprise some investors are locking in some profits, including CEO Jensen Huang who is reported to have sold around $95mn of stock in recent days. But although NVIDIA has sneezed, the wider market hasn’t caught a cold with a mixture of less extreme movements in both directions for the rest of the magnificent 7 [tech giants Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta]. Meanwhile, in other sectors US stocks saw gains in energy, financials and utilities: a vote of confidence by investors in the health of the broader economy. Nvidia’s shares are on track for further losses when Wall Street opens in five and a half hours time. Pre-market trading has just opened, and they’re down 2.1% at $115.64, on track for a fourth day of losses, pulling Nvidia deeper into a correction. That would leave its shares slightly above the short-term support level identified by traders (see earlier post). Airbus’s woes have hit UK aerospace manufacturers. Rolls-Royce, which makes and maintains jet engines, are down 3.3% in London, while Melrose, which produces engine components, are down 3.7%. Elsewhere in the markets, European aerospace giant Airbus has tumbled 9% this morning after cutting its profit forecasts last night. Investors are ditching Airbus after it warned of persistent supply chain disruptions and challenges in its space business last night. Airbus now expects to make around 770 commercial jets this year, down from a previous target of 800, saying: In commercial aircraft, Airbus is facing persistent specific supply chain issues mainly in engines, aerostructures and cabin equipment. Airbus is also taking a €900m charge at its Space Systems, after discovering “further commercial and technical” challenges. It adds: These are mainly related to updated assumptions on schedules, workload, sourcing, risks and costs over the lifetime of certain telecommunications, navigation and observation programmes. European chip stocks are feeling a chill from Nvidia. ASML Holding, the Netherlands firm which makes machines to produce semiconductors, are down 2.7% this morning. Another Dutch chip equipment maker, BE semiconductor Industries, are down 2.5%. They had both enjoyed strong gains in the last 12 months. The drop in chipmakers such as Nvidia may show that a 'rotation’ has begun in the US stock markets, with money moving away from the mega cap technology stocks which have been a major driver of gains this year. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says: The stellar rise of tech and AI-related stocks in particular inevitably gets to the stage where investors pause for breath and recalculate valuation levels. Over recent days the more traditional Dow Jones index has been the subject of buying interest at the expense of the more tech exposed S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq indices, as investors seek alternatives such as financials and utilities, and more broadly in value stocks which have been left behind by the tech surge. After two weaker trading sessions, market darling Nvidia fell a further 6.7% while other chip stocks such as Broadcom and Qualcomm fell between 3% and 6%. While it is far too early to call an end to the current run, such minor corrections are generally seen as healthy, while the expected downward direction of travel for interest rates provides a comforting backdrop as companies more broadly are comfortable to borrow to grow their businesses. The drop in Nvidia’s share price in the last three sessions will be painful for investors who had bought call options in the chipmaker. Call options give the right (but not the obligation) to buy a stock in future at a fixed price. There had been booming interest in call options in Nvidia, which paid out if its stock kept rising – a profitable trade, until the last few trading sessions. The biggest profits were to be made in buying ‘out of the money’ Nvidia call options, which would only pay off it its stock climbed sharply higher. Arguably those call options helped to drive up stocks too, as traders who had written the option could protect themselves by buying the underlying share, just in case they rose above the ‘strike price’ (when the option is then ‘in the money’) It’s important to remember that Nvidia is an extremely volatile stock. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, explains: The chart below shows Nvidia 1-month call option volatility and the Vix (green line). The calm Vix index hides the fact that the second-best performer on the index is extremely volatile. As we have said before, Nvidia does experience periods of extreme volatility, both to the upside and to the downside. If you own this stock, you need to make peace with that. But the other issue is that Nvidia’s stock was looking a little pricy. Brooks writes: Not even the stock split earlier this month has dampened down Nvidia’s stock price volatility. Analysts have upgraded their forecasts for their Q2 earnings in the last 4 weeks, however, with a 12-month forward P/E ratio of 42, higher than the average for the S&amp;P 500 of 25.6, there is no denying that Nvidia is starting to look a bit rich. While we don’t deny that Nvidia is delivering on the earnings front: it is expected to deliver $28bn of revenue in Q3, and operating profits of $18.5bn, investors must pay up for these earnings. Thus, there is less room for Nvidia to slip up when it delivers its earnings reports, which may worry some investors. Tech is a multiyear theme, especially Artificial Intelligence, thus we do not expect Nvidia’s stock price to fall off a cliff, but a pullback is to be expected. Added to this, it is normal for investors to pause and consider if a stock is looking overvalued, even a stock like Nvidia. After a three-day slide, financial traders are wondering how much further Nvidia’s shares may fall. Bloomberg reports that traders are turning to technical analysis for clues on where the bottom may be. Yesterday’s 6.7% drop took Nvidia’s share price down to $118, having briefly hit an alltime high of $140 last week. Buff Dormeier, chief technical analyst at Kingsview Partners, sees short-term support around the $115 level, with the next significant level at $100. These support levels are calculated by using Fibonacci retracement levels, using stock price data to work out where a stock might have support on the way down, or face resistance on the way up. Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, points out that Nvidia’s longer-term trend remains strong – the stock is still trading well above its 50-day moving average around $101 and 100-day moving average at $92. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Nvidia, one of the hottest shares on the market this year, has dropped into a correction – leaving traders worrying that the air is coming out of the AI stock boom. After three days of chunky falls, Nvidia’s stock has now dropped by 13% since – briefly – becoming the world’s largest company a week ago. Yesterday it tumbled by 6.7% on Wall Street, taking its losses over the last few days to over $500bn(!). That’s the biggest three-day value loss for any company in history, Bloomberg reports. Nvidia’s falls pulled the wider market down too, as Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank explained this morning: Nvidia has been driving markets again over the last 24 hours, as its share price came down another -6.68%, building on its -4.03% decline over the previous week and -16.1% from the intra-day high on Thursday. In turn, that held down US equity returns more broadly, as the losses for Nvidia pushed the NASDAQ (-1.09%) and the S&amp;P 500 (-0.31%) into negative territory for the day. Nvidia’s share price falls follow a stellar run – the stock is still up almost 140% in 2024, and has almost tripled over the last 12 months. The rally had been driven by excitement about artificial intelligence systems, which are powered by Nvidia’s high-end chips. But some analysts had been concerned that the AI boom had run too high, and was turning into a bubble. David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, says there are signs of profit taking by investors who bought shares in “Market darling Nvidia” on the way up: Some profit-taking seems entirely reasonable given NVIDIA’s meteoric rise. The stock was up over 180% this year alone. But if it continues to lose ground, then there’s a danger of contagion, with selling spreading to other big tech names. If that were the case, then the market could be in for a deeper and more protracted pull-back. Yet there are few indications that investors are even thinking along these lines. Nvidia has been posting very impressive financial results this year. In the last quarter, revenues surged by 262% year-on-year, with earnings per share up a staggering 629%. But the enthusiasm for Nvidia’s stock this year had pushed its valuation to levels that implied it would keep beating expectations with stellar revenue and earnings. Another factor weighing on Nvidia is that CEO Jensen Huang has been selling stock this month, through a trading plan. That has focused attention on whether the stock was somewhat overvaued. Another point: we’ve approaching the end of the financial quarter – so some investors will be rebalancing portfolios and cashing in profits. Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at capital.com, explains: It’s difficult to extrapolate what can be attributed to technical factors and what’s fundamentals in the markets, with price action apparently driven by end-of-month and end-of-quarter positioning.

        "title": "UK winemaker Chapel Down considers raising cash or sale as trade sparkles",
        "content": "Britain’s biggest wine producer, Chapel Down, is considering raising cash and even putting itself up for sale to fund more vineyards and build a new winery in a booming industry transformed by rising temperatures and tax breaks. Chapel Down in Kent is Britain’s best-known producer, founded in 2002 and is expected to make 3.4m bottles of sparkling and still wines from last year’s harvest. It is looking for more funds for its growth strategy, which includes investing in new vineyards, a new winery to be up and running for the 2026 harvest, and the development of its wine estate at Tenterden. It said: “As part of the review, the board will consider all alternatives, including investment from existing shareholders, investment from new shareholders, a sale of the company, and other relevant transactions.” After posting revenue of £18m last year, the company said it was on track for double-digit sales growth this year. Its shares have risen by 14.5% since their debut on London’s junior Aim market last year, moving from the Aquis Exchange, and fell 1.2% on Tuesday, giving Chapel Down a market value of £111m. Britain’s wine industry is still small and concentrated in southern England, but rising temperatures created better growing conditions for grapes, resulting in a boom in new vineyards. Vines are being planted as far north as Yorkshire and Scotland, and their UK number has almost tripled from two decades ago to 943. However, in traditional wine-growing regions such as Italy, Spain, France and southern California, extreme heat is expected to decimate harvests. British wine is also growing in popularity: almost a third of Britons said they would celebrate a wedding with English fizz in a recent Aldi survey, while 15% would serve up champagne at a divorce celebration. Britain is the fastest-growing wine region in the world, according to the property group Knight Frank. Between 2017 and 2022, England and Wales more than doubled wine production from 5.3m to 12.2m bottles, according to WineGB. It expects wine production to double again to 24.7m bottles by 2032. The UK has also caught the eye of Pommery and Taittinger, two of France’s best-known champagne houses, which both bought land and planted vines in England about a decade ago, while the world’s biggest sparkling wine producer, Germany’s Henkell Freixenet, snapped up the English wine estate Bolney in 2022. Last year was a record harvest and will be remembered as a “near perfect year” for vineyards, WineGB said. There was little spring frost, good flowering weather in June, and after a wet July and August some very warm spells in September and October. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Chapel Down has made a name for itself over the years but the business appears to have a hit the ceiling in terms of scale. To grow even more, it really needs a big slug of cash to invest in the business and that might be better coming from a new, bigger owner, rather than going cap in hand to shareholders on an ad hoc basis. “Plenty of big drinks companies would be in the market for a niche player like Chapel Down as it could add something new for them to get their teeth into, and also as a way of cross-selling products.”",

        "title": "‘Songwriters deserve a bigger piece of the pie’: the music publishing boss on the threat of AI",
        "content": "Arriving in London in the teeth of the pandemic to take a top music industry job, Shani Gonzales had few opportunities to immerse herself in British culture, with venues shut and parties off the table. The New Yorker instead turned to TV for her education, bingeing on The Crown, Downton Abbey and – a more left-field choice – Naked Attraction. “I was trying to get as much of a cross-section as possible!” says Gonzales, who heads the UK arm of music publishing giant Warner Chappell. “Music is culture, taste, environment – it felt daunting not being able to leave the house and meet artists in a role like this.” Nearly four years on, she has hit her stride and believes her appointment provides a signal for songwriters. “[The UK] is a very important music market, both historically and continues to be cool … But also I’m American, so clearly we’re showing you that we walk the walk – you come and sign here and it isn’t just a UK approach.” She says expanding songwriters’ reach globally has boosted Warner Chappell’s revenues. The publisher traces its roots to 1811 and has been in its current form since the 1980s, its history connecting the compositions of Ludwig van Beethoven to modern artists such as Lizzo and Madonna. Its roster includes David Bowie, Dua Lipa and Shaboozey. While music labels are occupied with the business of record releases and artists’ tours, publishers act as “labels” for songwriters, helping land them licensing deals, collecting royalties, connecting them with recording artists and getting songs played on adverts, film and TV. Their charges may be big name singer-songwriters in their own right, lower-profile artists, or, increasingly, dedicated behind-the scenes songwriters, who also attract fame. Warner Chappell has just over 12% of the music publishing market, lagging rivals Sony and Universal, which have about double that share each. But the company is on the front foot. Last year it broke $1bn in revenues for the first time. In the UK, profits rose sharply to almost £26m on turnover of £137m, which is up 29% on 2022, according to its last publicly available accounts. “This business cannot and does not stop in the US, so we’ve made some changes, paid more attention around the world, and been more global, not just local,” Gonzales says in her London office off Kensington High Street, where gold and platinum discs from artists such as Rihanna and Central Cee are stacked up. She praises Len Blavatnik, Britain’s second richest person, according to the Sunday Times rich list, who is a majority owner of Warner Music through his Access Industries vehicle, saying he is “tuned in and paying attention”. (She’s met him “a couple of times” but “we don’t braid each other’s hair and toast marshmallows on the weekends”, she jokes.) But despite the rising revenues, the industry faces a significant headache in the form of generative AI – from machine-spawned songs deliberately designed to land on popular playlists to video mock-ups of artists singing covers. “I want to make sure my songwriters and artists continue to be treated fairly and compensated financially. There’s so many versions of AI – the people who are providing the lyric and the melody that generative AI is learning from need to be remunerated,” says Gonzales. “You can play around in the studio and you can make, like, Drake sing a Bruce Springsteen tune. Right now, people are just having fun and throwing it up online, but what happens when someone says: ‘I’m going to sell that’? I wouldn’t go to a restaurant, take the food and not expect to [pay].” Gonzales believes governments need to step in to tackle the issue and prevent a repeat of the piracy that ravaged the CD industry. “It took years to recover from that,” she says, admitting she happily used the file-sharing software Napster as a “dumb college kid”. The roots of her career were set before college, however. Her mother and father had migrated from Jamaica and Trinidad respectively, with Gonzales born while they were studying at Cornell University. She grew up in Queens, New York City, and recalls her bemused dad watching on as she “blustered about the house crying” over the death of rapper Biggie Smalls. Shunning expectations that she would go to law school, she pursued a career in the music industry, although her initial intention was to eschew the unstable hedonism of being an artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) representative, the industry’s talent scouts. However, she eventually relented and rose through the ranks, developing artists including DJ Khaled, Justin Bieber and a young Travis Scott. She moved through some of the industry’s biggest companies – BMI, Epic Records, Def Jam and BMG – and led international A&amp;R for Warner Chappell before her current role. Today, one issue is a constant for her: artist remuneration. Returns to artists have been described as “pitiful”. The singer Raye, who dominated at this year’s Brit awards and with whom Gonzales has worked closely, has claimed “songwriters are being manipulated” in the industry and called on other artists to push the cause for better pay for them. “I agree with her, and I respect that she is using her platform and fame to talk about it,” says Gonzales. “Songwriters do deserve a bigger piece of the pie, and that’s what we’re here to do.” Is it embarrassing to present streaming royalties of fractions of a penny to her talent? “I don’t know if I find it embarrassing – it’s a moment to teach them how, or if, you want to prioritise commerciality versus creativity. It’s a balance. Sometimes it’s fractions of a penny and you say ‘something’s got to change’ – at other times, it seems about right.” Another boss who has pushed for better returns for songwriters is Merck Mercuriadis, whose company Hipgnosis hit turmoil over the valuation of the music rights it owns. Industry sources had long griped over Hipgnosis’s tactics, claiming it had overpaid and driven up the price of big artists’ back catalogues. “They definitely got to a level of ambition that I did not always appreciate … I was curious about how they value things and if it could sustain itself long term,” Gonzales says. But with Sony reportedly landing Queen’s back catalogue for a record-breaking $1bn last week, the volume is still turned up on music dealmaking.

        "title": "‘Skinny jabs’: weight-loss drugs set for new boom as generic versions emerge",
        "content": "Medicines that enable dramatic weight loss are likely to experience a new boom in uptake, experts have said, as the first generic versions hit the market this week at a lower cost than the original drugs. The injections, dubbed “skinny jabs” by the media, can help people lose more than 10% of their body weight and have become hugely popular in recent years, with celebrities lauding their effects. They include Wegovy and Saxenda, which are licensed for weight loss, and Ozempic and Victoza which are licensed for type 2 diabetes but are often prescribed “off-label” as a weight-loss aid. All four mimic a gut hormone called GLP-1 and are produced by the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk. It announced on Tuesday that it was to invest more than $4bn (£3.2bn) in US plants manufacturing the injectable drugs to try to meet booming demand. While such treatments are available to some patients on the NHS, private access is expensive, and recent shortages have made them hard to get hold of. But change is afoot. Patents for Victoza and Saxenda have expired, according to Novo Nordisk. As a result, other drugmakers are working on generic versions. Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries the world’s largest generic drugmaker, launched a generic version of Victoza in the US on Monday. The move comes days after the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, tentatively approved London-based Hikma Pharmaceuticals’ generic version of Victoza. They are not alone: among others reported to be planning to launch their own generic liraglutide products (the active ingredient in Victoza and Saxenda) are Pfizer, Viatris’s Mylan and Novartis’s Sandoz. Such drugs are cheaper than the originals. According to Teva, the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of its new generic will be 13.6% lower in price than Victoza at $469.60 for the two-pack and $704.40 for the three-pack. “WAC pricing does not account for the price discounts offered to customers and is not reflective of our final net price,” a company spokesperson said. But this is only the beginning, with Ozempic and Wegovy both losing patent protection in China in 2026, in Europe and Japan in 2031, and in the US in 2032. Prof Giles Yeo of the University of Cambridge said generic versions will lead to a further boom in use – particularly in lower-income countries. “Rich people will always want the shinier new drugs,” he said, adding that newer medications will probably have fewer side-effects. Mark Samuels, the chief executive of the British Generic Manufacturers Association (BGMA), described the first wave of generic weight-loss medicines as a “potentially transformative opportunity for public health”. “The current market is largely private via patients who are self-paying,” he said. “The cost of the patented medicine is often prohibitive for the NHS, so it has been sparingly prescribed by clinicians. However, the onset of generic competition will likely significantly reduce the price, and this means the NHS can afford to treat more patients. This has a broader population health benefit as greater access to these medicines will reduce the crippling strain obesity-related conditions have on NHS resources.” In the UK, generic competition typically reduces prices paid by the NHS by as much as 80% to 90% after loss of exclusivity, according to the BGMA. Dr Simon Cork of Anglia Ruskin University said competition in the form of new medications will also play a big role in any future pricing arrangements of those that now exist. Eli Lilly’s diabetes drug Mounjaro has just been approved for obesity in the UK and it is developing another weight-loss drug, Retatrutide. “Competition will, I suspect, reduce the cost of these medications, particularly since the drugs coming on to the market often display more favourable weight loss than semaglutide,” he said. Victoza brought in £245m of sales for Novo Nordisk in the first three months of this year, down by 23% from a year earlier, while Saxenda’s first-quarter sales halved to £188m. Last year, Victoza made £982m of sales, down by 30% on 2022, while Saxenda posted revenues of £1.2bn, down 4%. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry has defended the use of patents as being vital to health breakthroughs. Claire Machin, the industry body’s executive director of international policy and UK competitiveness, said developing drugs was a high-risk process, with the average cost of taking a medicine from discovery to launch put at $2.3bn last year. “For every 10,000 compounds that are tested, only one or two will successfully pass all stages of research and development and clinical trials to become licensed medicines available to patients,” she said. “A strong intellectual property framework enables the development of cutting-edge medicines and sustains future innovation.” While generic forms of Victoza are appearing this month, Yeo said the big turning point will be when semaglutide – the active ingredient of Ozempic and Wegovy – can be made as a generic. “A powerful drug will then be available to the vast majority of the world, which would be amazing,” he said. Cork said any reduction in cost was to be welcomed, not least because at present GLP-1 analogues can only be prescribed for use for two years on the NHS for eligible patients. “This was introduced in no small part because of the questionable cost effectiveness of their continued use,” he said. “A reduction in the cost would shift the balance of this cost effectiveness, potentially paving the way for their longer-term use – especially when coupled with research showing the reversal of weight loss after patient stop taking them, and the continued benefit in cardiovascular risk associated with longer term use.” Dr Ivan Koychev of the University of Oxford, who is researching the application of GLP-1 analogues in dementia patients, said demand for such drugs was currently outstripping supply as a result of the high prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. “This is evidenced by members of the public sourcing these medications online or attempting to reconstitute the drugs themselves,” he said. While it is unclear how widespread the practice is, internet forums including Reddit have numerous examples of people reporting that they have been injecting themselves with such “DIY” preparations. However, experts have warned the approach is dangerous, with some people taking unlicensed versions of semaglutide ending up needing emergency hospital care after buying from unregulated online sellers without a prescription. Yeo said the availability of cheaper generic versions of drugs such as semaglutide could help to tackle the problem. “Becoming a generic will make its supply far safer, because that would undercut the hidden market in the product,” Yeo said. “We’ll also have far more information about its long-term safety profile, which can only be a good thing.”",

        "title": "Vauxhall owner says plants could shut unless UK helps EV makers",
        "content": "The owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands has warned its car plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton could close unless market demand for electric vehicles picks up and the UK loosens regulations. The UK managing director of Stellantis said the company did not want to shut operations in the UK but it would make a decision in “less than a year” in the face of unreasonable government sales quotas and the lack of consumer incentives in relation to VAT on vehicles and electricity. “You have to make strategies that are based on efficiency. I want to keep the production [in the] UK and I want to be clear on this,” Maria Grazia Davino said. It is “stupid” for government not to work with industry to protect jobs, she said. She added that the demand for EVs was “soft” and unless there were further incentives for businesses to buy the electric commercial vehicles or more support from the government the firm may have no choice. “The demand is not coming. We expect the government whoever it is to respond to this. We work together in the country for the benefit of the health of economy and the people,” she said. “Whoever gets to the government they have to listen … In the UK there will be consequences for sure on the production. Stellantis UK does not stop. Stellantis production in the UK could stop.” The warning comes weeks after the chief executive of Stellantis criticised the government’s EV policy as “terrible”, saying it could ultimately lead to car manufacturing facing bankruptcy. Carlos Tavares blamed the UK’s quota system, which forces manufacturers to meet sales targets that he said were “double” the market demand. The so-called zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate forces manufacturers to sell an increasing proportion of electric cars. The ZEV mandate applies to all car sales, whether made in the UK or imported, so it is unclear why it would force a manufacturer to shut down British plants that export significant volumes. However, Stellantis wants the electric vans it makes in those factories to count as cars for the purposes of the ZEV mandate. That would make it much easier to hit the targets. Des Quinn, national officer for staff union Unite, said he would support a new government easing the ZEV mandate for those car companies that invested in the UK to protect jobs. “There’s got to be a balance,” he said. “I would give a bit to take something back in terms of automotive sector and industrial strategy.” It is the second time in a year that Stellantis has questioned the viability of factories at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, where it produces electric vans and cars after a £100m investment, and Luton, where it produces larger petrol and diesel vans, with electric versions to come next year. Earlier this year, the UK and European industry averted “cliff-edge” tariffs on imports and exports of EVs across the Channel because of a clause in the Brexit trade deal that was suspended for three years after pressure was put on EU leaders. The renewed closure threat will put pressure on Labour, which polls suggest will win the general election next week, to give carmakers more leeway. Davino said they had yet to have any talks with the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, or Labour leader, Keir Starmer. “We care about the employees. They are the reason why we work actually so hard. I work to keep my staff here and this is why I am advocating personally so much,” Davino told reporters at a conference organised by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a lobby group, in London. She said the government’s EV policy was affecting its business model, forcing it to “invest more” than the market demands, amid plateauing electric sales, making the justification for remaining in the UK less viable than plants elsewhere around the world. If the customer did not see an “advantage” in buying an EV they would continue buying conventional petrol or diesel vehicles, she said. Ashley Andrew, the president of Hyundai Motor UK, called on the government to “half the VAT” on EVs for consumers, which is now at 20%. He also called for VAT parity on electricity, with tax on home energy rated at 5% while those who charge on the public road are hit with 20% VAT on their bill. Stellantis started electric-only production at Ellesmere Port in 2023, producing a range of electric passenger vehicles including the Vauxhall Combo Life Electric, Peugeot e-Rifter and Citroën ë-Berlingo multi-purpose vehicles. The government has been approached for comment.",

        "title": "Airbus shares plunge as plane maker cuts profit forecast",
        "content": "Shares in Airbus tumbled on Tuesday after the aircraft maker cut its profit forecast and blamed persistent part shortages, which have affected production of its A320neo jets. In an unscheduled update late on Monday, Europe’s biggest aerospace group trimmed its delivery forecast, and pushed back the schedule for the production ramp-up of A320neo planes. Airbus also took a €900m (£761m) charge for its troubled space activities. Airbus shares fell almost 10% on Tuesday. The company now expects underlying operating income of €5.5bn this year, below its previous forecast of between €6.5bn and €7bn. This is because it estimates that it will deliver 770 aircraft this year, down from its earlier forecast of 800, albeit higher than last year’s 735 jets. It also moved its production target of making 75 A320neo aircraft a month from 2026 to 2027. At the moment, it is making about 50 jets a month. Airbus said it faced “persistent” and “specific” supply-chain problems, mainly affecting engines, cabin equipment and aerostructures (components of the airframe such as wings and fuselage). The Airbus chief executive, Guillaume Faury, said: “We are facing headwinds right now; we have to bite the bullet.” He said supplies of engines for its bestselling A320 family of narrow-body jets had worsened “significantly” in recent months. Faury said engine makers would have to “face the consequences” of any delays, which could imply penalties. He said Rolls-Royce-made engines for the A330neo were behind schedule, but not those for the A350. Shortages of seats and cabin parts were another “very difficult situation,” Faury said. The aerospace industry has been struggling to rehire workers and stabilise supplies after the Covid-19 pandemic left many suppliers with weak balance sheets. As the world’s biggest aircraft producer, Airbus has borne the brunt of the problem while its main US rival Boeing faces regulatory curbs and an internal crisis, but some experts and suppliers, including engine makers, have long expressed doubts about its plans, saying they were too ambitious. Faury said an uncertain outlook for the industrial commitments of aerostructures maker Spirit Aerosystems had contributed to the new, lower targets. He declined to comment on a widely expected deal in which Airbus would acquire Spirit assets related to the A350 and A220 jet programmes, as part of a carve-up of the supplier with Boeing, which is expected in the coming days or weeks. Boeing is inching closer to a deal to buy back Spirit after its former subsidiary made substantial progress in separate talks with Airbus over a transatlantic breakup of the struggling supplier, Reuters reported last week.",

        "content": "Novo Nordisk is to invest more than $4bn (£3.2bn) in US manufacturing as it battles to keep up with booming demand for its obesity and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Denmark’s biggest pharmaceuticals company said it would spend $4.1bn building a second filling and finishing facility in Clayton, North Carolina, one of the biggest manufacturing investments in its history. Its drugs are injected by users once a week, and come in pre-filled pens. The facility, which will have roof-top solar panels, will double the space of Novo Nordisk’s three existing facilities in North Carolina, and add 1,000 jobs, on top of the nearly 2,500 people already working for the drugmaker in the state. The company’s president and chief executive, Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, said: “It took us a century to reach 40 million patients, but through this expansion and continued investment in our global production, we’re building Novo Nordisk’s ability to serve millions more people living with serious chronic diseases in the future. “This is yet another real signal of our efforts to scale up our production to meet the growing global need for our life-changing medicines and the patients of tomorrow.” Overall, Novo Nordisk plans to invest $6.8bn in production this year compared with $3.9bn last year, to increase supply of its injectable drugs. Wegovy and Ozempic have become hugely popular amid an obesity crisis in many countries, which led to shortages and the company rationing the use of them. The medicines have been endorsed by celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, although others such as the US comedian Amy Schumer have said they stopped taking Ozempic because of the side-effects. The success of its drugs has led to an 84% increase in Novo Nordisk shares in the past year, making it Europe’s most valuable company and its market value more than the entire Danish economy. Henrik Wulff, the firm’s executive vice-president for product supply, quality and IT, said: “Clayton was the first manufacturing site for Novo Nordisk in the US, and this new large-scale investment confirms the continued importance of our production facilities there as cornerstones of our company’s growth.” Wegovy and Ozempic are part of a new class of weight-loss and diabetes drugs known as GLP-1, which mimic the action of a gut hormone and suppress people’s appetite. They have helped some people lose significant amounts of weight but can cause unpleasant side-effects such as nausea. Novo Nordisk and its main competitor, the US drugmaker Eli Lilly, raised their sales forecasts last month. Eli Lilly’s diabetes treatment tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro, was approved for obesity at the beginning of this month, giving patients and doctors what the medical regulator said was a more effective alternative to semaglutide, better known as Wegovy.",

Citizens Advice said customer service ratings across the industry were among the lowest ever between January and March and average ratings had fallen by 10.5% compared with the same period in 2021. The charity also said it had been contacted for help with energy issues by record numbers of people last month and called for the industry regulator, Ofgem, to be handed stronger powers to tackle poor customer service. The research showed EDF Energy had received the lowest star rating out of 16 household suppliers last quarter, at 2.06 out of five. The findings represent a reversal for the supplier, which is owned by the French state; its average call waiting times have increased from just under a minute to more than five minutes in less than a year. Utilita was rated second worst, although its 2.08 rating was an improvement from the previous quarter, while British Gas, the UK’s biggest energy supplier, received a rating of 2.39. Ecotricity, a green energy supplier, was rated highest at 3.77, beating Outfox the Market and Ovo Energy. The ratings are calculated using data on complaints, call times and response times to customers by email and on social media. Citizens Advice said there had been an improvement in average call waiting times after guidance was introduced by Ofgem in December. The regulator now requires suppliers to contact customers if they miss two monthly or one quarterly payment to check if they are struggling with their bills and consider repayment options. However, companies performed badly on their ability to resolve customer complaints, which brought overall ratings down, the charity said. Energy suppliers have been in the spotlight since wholesale gas prices began to escalate in 2021, forcing suppliers out of business and pushing up household bills. Customer service has not returned to pre-crisis levels, which caused more people to seek support from suppliers over debts and an increase in the force-fitting of prepayment meters. The practice was temporarily banned in 2023 amid concerns that vulnerable consumers were being cut off from heat and power. Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “When millions are struggling to afford the essentials, it’s completely unacceptable that energy companies are failing to give their customers proper support. Citizens Advice has long called for Ofgem to be given stronger powers to hold suppliers to account on customer service. That must include tackling the complaints backlog before next winter.” The increase is household costs has eased since the height of the energy crisis, but they remain far higher than before it began. Next week Ofgem’s quarterly price cap will fall by £122 to the equivalent of £1,568 a year. “News that bills are dropping slightly from July will be cold comfort for the record numbers seeking help from our advisers. The next government must introduce better targeted energy bill support for those struggling to keep the lights on or cook a hot meal,” said Moriarty. An EDF spokesperson said: “We recognise our call answer times haven’t been up to the high standards we set ourselves and are committed to doing better, getting back to the market-leading service our customers expect.” A spokesperson for Utilita said: “We must not underestimate how savvy consumers are today. They will realise the star rating contradicts other market-wide supplier assessments – including those of Ofgem, Trustpilot and Which? – where Utilita performs consistently well.” British Gas declined to comment.",

        "title": "Britvic should play hardball: no Fruit Shoots on the cheap for Carlsberg | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "The omission in Carlsberg’s £3bn-plus takeover tilt for Britvic, the UK soft drinks firm behind Robinsons barley water, J2O, Tango and R White’s lemonade, has been resolved. The Danes, pursuing their “beyond beer” strategy, did not forget that PepsiCo could kill the whole adventure by yanking the UK bottling rights for Pepsi, 7Up and Lipton’s Ice Tea from Britvic under a “change of control” clause. The US fizzy drinks titan had agreed to waive the clause if the deal happened, Carlsberg said on Monday. Since nobody in their right mind would buy Britvic without those rights, this takeover tale would now seem to come down to the simple matter of price. Britvic has already rejected offers at £12 and £12.50 a share, it told the market on Friday. At what level would its board be obliged to surrender in usual boring fashion and declare that fair value has been reached? Well, one hopes the Britvic directors have stiffened their resolve with something stronger than a Fruit Shoot. If they truly believe their bullish talk in last month’s half-year numbers about “market-leading growth”, “multiple new growth spaces” and “our long-standing track record of delivering outstanding returns for our shareholders”, they should be up for a scrap. The point about Britvic is that, for the first time in ages, it can look forward to vaguely normal trading conditions. After a sugar tax, a pandemic –which clobbered high-margin sales to pubs and restaurants – and then a burst of inflation in raw materials for packaging and so on, life looks OK. The soft drinks market offers few examples of explosive growth (Fever-Tree was an exception) but Britvic’s wider portfolio can be expected to deliver sales growth of 5%-ish, double-digit margins and enough cash for modest share buy-backs, which have been £75m in recent years. By way of add-on excitement, it has a smaller operation in Brazil that is growing at a decent clip. Before the pandemic, the shares were around the £10 mark and the return to close to that level, before Carlsberg showed up, was justified by the numbers. City analysts expect profits to top £200m this year and earnings per share to improve at a steady rate of 10%-ish for the next couple. The board’s rejection of £12.50 as a “significant undervaluation” was justified. Perhaps surprisingly given its size and the fame of its core brand, Carlsberg looks to be the party with the strategic conundrum. Its beer business in the UK, a joint venture with Marston’s, is No 4 in the market. It would prefer the UK, rather than China, to be its biggest market. And it wants to be less reliant on beer at a time when per-capita consumption of alcohol is falling in western Europe. So Britvic, offering easy savings in distribution costs in the UK, makes for an understandable purchase. But those factors also mean the target should be prepared to play hard to get. Investec’s analyst, Matthew Webb, thinks £13.50, or a 39% premium to the share price before the fun started, “would be enough to get the deal done”. But, actually, there’s a fair argument that Britvic’s board should hold out for more: think £14 to surrender independence. Remember, you only get to sell the company once and the UK market can be terrible at valuing FTSE 250 companies fairly. Only fizzy terms should do.",

        "title": "Two-thirds of green energy projects in Great Britain fail to clear planning stage",
        "content": "Two-thirds of applications to build renewable energy projects in Great Britain have failed to get through the planning stage over the past five years, hampering efforts to shift towards clean electricity generation. A study of Britain’s “renewables pipeline” found that 63% of mooted projects were either abandoned, refused planning permission, or an application was withdrawn or ultimately expired between 2018 and 2023. The remainder of the applications were either approved or revised, according to the research by the consultancy Cornwall Insight. Renewable energy developers have bemoaned the difficulty in gaining planning permission for projects – from offshore windfarms to onshore solar and battery storage developments – and waiting times to connect to Britain’s electricity grid of more than a decade. The research found no region of Great Britain had a success rate higher than 20% of projects gaining planning permission. Cornwall Insight said “speculative and duplicate applications” were in part to blame, citing reports that “phantom” energy projects were holding back efforts to decarbonise the grid. Last year, a report commissioned by Centrica, the owner of British Gas, claimed that some developers were applying to connect projects to the grid that did not even have land rights or planning consent applications. National Grid and Ofgem, the industry regulator, have attempted to remove “zombie projects” – those that have been approved but have stopped being developed – from the connections queue. The problem has also been blamed for years-long delays to new housing schemes. Lucy Dolton, the assets and infrastructure manager at Cornwall Insight, said: “It’s clear that an increasing number of the applications submitted are speculative, raising the numbers in the connections queue, and creating obstacles for projects that are mostly ready to connect.” The amount of electricity generated by the UK’s gas and coal power plants fell by 20% last year to its lowest level since 1957. Renewable energy provided the single largest source of power at 42%, although gas power plants still accounted for 31%. The Conservatives have set a goal to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035, while Labour is targeting 2030. Both parties have pledged to slim down the planning regime if they win next month’s general election. The Conservatives have promised to speed up the average time it takes to sign off a big infrastructure project from four years to one year. Labour has said it will update planning policies and fund extra planning officers. The party has made energy policy a central pillar of its election campaign. It has pledged to set up a state-owned company, Great British Energy, and set targets to double onshore wind, quadruple offshore wind and triple solar power by 2030 in an effort to ultimately hit the UK’s legally binding commitment to reach net zero by 2050. However, the party was also accused of making the “mother of all U-turns” in February, dropping a plan to invest £28bn a year in green energy. Dolton added: “The total capacity of projects in the grid connection queue is currently well in excess of what is necessary for net zero generation capacity. However, considering the lengthy process for projects to progress through planning and gain grid connections, and the current volume of projects that are unsuccessful, the amount of this capacity that will ultimately connect could be much lower than the pipeline of projects suggests.” Campaigners have argued that allowing renewable developments on a relatively small proportion of extra land could make a significant difference. Research by Friends of the Earth and the University of Exeter this year found that England could produce 13 times more renewable energy than it did now, while using less than 3% of its land.",

        "title": "Brussels accuses Apple of breaking EU rules; Badenoch and Reynolds clash over business – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up…. Business secretary Kemi Badenoch has told UK business leaders they should not risk handing the economy to Labour. Her opposite number, Jonathan Reynolds, has argued that businesses can’t risk another five years of a chaotic and unstable Conservative government. Reynolds and Badenoch also clashed over the UK’s net zero plans, plans for apprenticeships, and were also quizzed about their leadership ambitions. Here are today’s main stories: The Bloomberg debate wrapped up with quick statements from the two protagonists. Jonathan Reynolds goes first, saying businesses are facing too many serious challenges to risk another five years of a chaotic and unstable government. “It’s time to return to a government that solves problems, rather than causing then”, he says, pledging to keep working with businesses after the election. Kemi Badenoch says the difference between the two parties is that Labour want to bring in new laws that make it harder to hire staff, and to micro manage businesses. Conservatives believe in capitalism, she pledges, the power of business to do good. “We don’t think profit is a dirty word, and we are optimistic about our future,” Badenoch concludes. And finally… Q: Bloomberg turns to its guests’ leadership ambitions. Jonathan Reynolds gets the giggles, turning red, before insisting he is “very much focused” on becoming the secretary state for business and trade. Keir Starmer has done a “quite exceptional” job of turning Labour around, he adds. Kemi Badenoch (who has been cited as a potential leader if the Conservatives are hammered in next month’s election) says the question was obviously meant for her (getting Reynolds guffawing). Badenoch says she stood for the leadership before, and lost, and is now “terrified” at the prospect of Labour coming into power. She insisted there was “no better job” than Business and Trade Secretary, which “is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister”. Q: Some cabinet ministers may lose their seats… would you be up for the leadership challenge if it came up? Badenoch says leadership issues will be discussed after the election, not before…. That doesn’t exactly rule out a Badenoch bid… and appears to leave the door open for one…. Q: Should Thames Water be nationalised? Kemi Badenoch says Thames Water is a “very, very difficult” situation; she doesn’t want to move markets by discussing nationalisation while it is going through difficulties. Reminder: The Guardian reported in April that the government was considering radical plans to renationalise Thames Water, under which most of its £15.6bn debt would be added to the public purse. The palava with Thames Water shows that the UK’s regulatory system is not working well, as the company tries to make a profit, keep bills low, and invest in infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds says people are unhappy about the state of the UK water industry. Reynolds hopes that nationalisation can be avoided, pointing out that investment must involve losing as well as gaining money. Onto topical issues. Q: Have you met with Shein, and would you put any restrictions if they chose to list in the UK [a decision which is moving closer…]. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour have met with Shein. Many people who are considering economic activity in the UK have spoken to Labour in recent years, he explains. His view is that if companies are doing businesses in the UK, they should be regulated from the UK. So, a listing would be the way to enforce the “highest standards” on, for example, the labour market, regulatory compliance, or tax. Any listed company in the UK has a fairly significant set of compliance placed upon them. If you are keen to see businesses operating to the highest standards, you should want to see them do that from the UK. Kemi Badenoch, the current business and trade secretary, reveals she has NOT met with Shein. She has two concerns with a potential Shein listing in London. 1) The way Shein ships individually packaged orders directly from Chinese warehouses to consumers’ homes, meaning they fall below the £135 threshold for import duty “That could mean quite a lot lost in terms of taxes,” Badenoch says. 2) Concerns that Shein are using forced labor in Xinjiang. Q: What’s your policy on money from the Middle East and China? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour is extremely keen to bring in overseas investment. The Gulf is an “obvious place to look for that” money, he says, while China brings different considerations in terms of national security. Labour will hold an investment summit in its first 100 days of power, he says, and ‘make the case’ for investing in Britain. Reynolds says many of Labour’s plans come from the “reasonable complaints” of businesses who said they considered investing in the UK, but were put off by the prime minister changing, or because they didn’t know the country’s plans post-2016 (the year of the Brexit vote). Kemi Badenoch says the UK already has the largest foreign domestic investment of an European country. Q: What will you do to help small businesses get paid on time? Kemi Badenoch says it is “extraordinary” how larger corporations treat smaller firms in their supply chain. “We will look again” at more regulations to speed up payments, she pledges. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour would force the audit committees of large public companies to say how quickly they pay their suppliers – that would address the power inbalance that allows them to leave small firms waiting for money…. Kemi Badenoch is then asked about why more trade deals haven’t been signed. Badenoch says the US government is not signing any free trade deals at the moment, so the UK has been signing agreements with individual US states instead. It has been “very difficult” negotiating with India, she adds; any deal with Delhi has to work for business. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour will improve the UK’s relationship with the European Union – starting with it not being governed by the internal politics of the Conservative Party. He says Labour will seek to reduce checks on food and agricultural products, and to improve the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Reynolds argues that ‘relitigating the arguments on the customs unions or the single markets would not provide the stability Britain needs. Q: The EU say they’re open to negotiating a deal to ease border friction for fresh food, for example, but it must have a role for the European Court of Justice. Will you accept that? Reynolds says Labour won’t give away its negotiating hand. But surely, if you don’t want lower food standards than the EU, you can remove some of the trade frictions and costs. Kemi Badenoch says the Conservative government tried to strike such a deal, but the EU wouldn’t accept it. She insists the UK can’t accept oversight by the ECJ. Onto Brexit! Q: What is your top proposal to cut costs for businesses exporting to the EU? Kemi Badenoch claims that it’s hard to tell the impact of Brexit, versus the impact of the pandemic. But she insists that services exports have been “going gangbusters”, making the UK the 2nd largest services exporter, and the 4th largest exporter in the world. “Those are facts”. Well….. this thread from Sky News’s Ed Conway shows that the picture is not quite as rosy as that: Next issue – fiscal issues, and the IMF’s warning that both major parties’ manifestos are too opaque and lack detail on tax and spend. Q: They say voters will be voting in a knowledge vacuum…. Kemi Badenoch says she “completely disagrees” with IFS’s assessment. The truth is that people are not placing their votes based on the IFS’s analysis, but actually base it on what a party believes in, and what its values are. She says the mini-budget showed the problems of cutting tax without cutting spending. We are the party of sound money, of business, Badenoch promises. Jonathan Reynolds says he respects the IFS…. and agrees that the Conservatives record speaks for itself (!). Taxes are at a record high, and public services don’t reflect that tax burden. The key is to break out of this low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop, Reynolds says – and that’s Labour’s plan. He says the UK would have billions of pounds more, if the economy had grown at the rate of the last Labour government. Q: Are you ready to fight interest groups which won’t like the planning changes you have in mind? Reynolds says that’s why Labour needs a mandate, so it can build the homes and infrastructure Britain needs. Kemi Badenoch disputes this claim, pointing out that Labour members of the House of Lords had blocked the government’s attempts to remove nutrient neutrality rules, and free up housebuilding. Next, a question on Labour’s plans for more protection against unfair dismissal, and ending zero-hours contracts. Q: Is a Labour government going to make life much harder for small businesses? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour’s manifesto is “a pro-worker, pro-business” agenda, that – he says – has been developed closely with businesses. That includes a better business environment, changes to planning rules, certainty on tax, that will deliver more growth. Reynolds adds that “The floor will rise”, but insists the vast majority of businesses are already operating at a much higher level than this new, higher floor already. Kemi Badenoch hits back, saying it’s businesses don’t want these measures. She claims it’s “unbelievable” that Reynolds claims these new regulations have been developed with businesses. She insists: Businesss is terrified of what Labour is selling. Badenoch says Labour’s plans for employment rights from day one are unpopular, and that the CEOs of Asda, Currys [see here] and M&amp;S have said these are “terrible regulations”. Reynolds returns fire, saying that the Conservative Party promised an employment bill after Brexit, and security in the workplace, and hasn’t delivered on it. Labour, he says, will create a better working environment, one where people have secure work they can build a family round. Badenoch won’t accept this, telling business leaders they should be “absolutely terrified” of “surrendering” your business, the economy, and tax, to Labour. Badenoch argues that Labour are “fishing in an empty barrel”, and that flexible working rights are not the cause of problems in the UK economy. Jonathan Reynolds agrees that governments must change their plans when circumstances change… …and blames Liz Truss’s “disastrous mini-budget” for forcing Labour to drop its £28bn green investment plans. He then returns to his criticism of Rishi Sunak’s climate u-turn speech last September, in which the PM pushed back the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers. That was a “short-lived relaunch of the Rishi Sunak premiership”, Reynolds says, to pitch the PM as a change candidate. Kemi Badenoch then explains that governments respond to changing circumstances and instability – citing elections in Europe, and across the Atlantic. In an apparent criticism of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, Badenoch declares: Look at what is happening in the US – we don’t even want to talk about the candidates that they’ve got for election, so many difficulties. This uncertainty is all over the world, and we have managed to keep our economy growing. [er, there was a shallow recession last year….] The point about net zero, Badenoch adds, is that it can be an opportunity, but other things need to be delivered too, on a “no regrets” basis. The CBI get the next question: Q: Is the transition to Net Zero a growth opportunity to be seized, or a cost to be mitigated? Labour’s Jonathan Reynolds insists it’s one of the greatest opportunities that have ever existed for the UK. The transition could address regional inequality, and some of the long-standing problems in the UK economy, he says. Government’s job is to build and shape the markets that the private sector will work in, he insists. He criticises the government for chopping and changing its own policies, and claims that Rishi Sunak’s climate u-turn speech last autumn was ‘dishonest’, as it talked about the costs today rather than the markets that are being built around the cost of transition. Investors need certainty, he says, and they don’t have it at the moment. Badenoch, though, says net zero is both an opportunity and a cost. She says there was cross-party agreement on net zero, before Covid and the War in Ukraine has changed the landscape. That’s why the PM made his announcement last year, she says, because circumstances changed. And she takes a swipe at Reynolds’ criticism of Sunak’s u-turn last year, saying: To say that is dishonest, is to just show a lack of understanding of the reality of governing. Jonathan Reynolds says he’d be “extremely worried” if Conservatives politicians were to pick which degrees had value. It would be another Culture War issue, he warns. Reynolds adds that the UK should be proud of its higher education sector – he wouldn’t want fewer young people in his constituency at Greater Manchester to go to university. Kemi Badenoch hits back on that last point – insisting the Conservatives do value higher education. But, if businesses tell us that the skills coming out of higher education are not the skills we need, we need to ‘re-orientate what we’re doing’, Badenoch explains. Q: so it about certain degrees that are not worth doing, or is it about what you could do instead? Badenoch says it’s both, saying the Conservatives want to reduce the courses where students end up earning less than if they’d not gone to university at all. So over to Jonathan Reynolds! He confirms that Labour’s flagship policy is to reform the apprenticeship levy, so that businesses can use some funds to other forms of training. He points out that the number of apprenticeships has declined, so giving businesses some flexibility makes sense. [Explainer: Under current rules, larger firms must give 0.5 per cent of their total payroll to HMRC, which can be claimed back to spend on apprenticeships. But the funds can only be spent on apprenticeship training and assessment with a training provider; the Treasury reclaims unspent levy money]. Reynolds adds that Labour want further education colleges specialise, and become technical excellence colleges. Reynolds also says he often worries about “the denegration of higher education by this Conservative government. We should be a country that can recognise the contributions that both sectors bring. Onto questions, first on skills. Q: The lack of skilled workers is the top issues hurting British businesses, according to the Institute of Directors. How will you fix it? Kemi Badenoch says we are in an era where the skills needed to grow the economy is changing, and that the government has invested £3.6bn in this. She says the government wants to make sure people can take apprenticeships to learn practical skills, rather than the “university degrees that some are taking that don’t necessarily deliver what we need for economic growth”. She says she’s worried by Labour’s plans, saying its apprenticeships reforms are unfunded…. Kemi Badenoch speaks next, saying business has a clear choice at the next election. She tells the audience at Bloomberg: The Conservatives, who are the party of entrepreneurs and wealth creators, or Labour, the party of trade unions and a big regulatory state. Badenoch says business owners need to think who is better for them, and their business. She points out that the last decade has been “the toughest” for businesses globally – starting with the aftermath of the global financial crisis, which was followed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Badenoch says: We’ve been challenged by a war in Europe that has raised energy costs at the same time that we decided to deliver net zero, which I know is a cost to business, while delivering an exit from the European Union, which the people voted for. Badenoch says it has been a time of “extreme global turbulence”, but inflation has been brought down, and the UK is forecast to grow faster than France, Italy, Germany and Japan over the next four years. She adds: Now is not the time for more uncertainty by handing the economy to Labour. You can watch the debate between Kemi Badenoch and Jonathan Reynolds here: Bloomberg are hosting a debate now between business secretary Kemi Badenoch and her Labour opposite number, Jonathan Reynolds. Reynolds speaks first, declaring that there’s no reasonable argument for the Conservative’s to remain in office. He says: The last 14 years have been marked by political chaos, by economic stagnation and – too frequently – by improper behaviour. Business and investors need stability, and that only comes with a change to a Labour government, Reynolds pledges. Reynolds adds that Labour have an agenda to get Britain moving: planning reform, an industrial strategy, ambitions on green energy, and a “pragmatic, good-faith” relationship with the EU. He adds reforming the apprentive levy, business rates, and an agenda for small businesses, to that list of plans. Reynolds says Labour is hugely appreciative of the support it has received from businesses, adding: Together we can turn the page on the last few years, look to the future, and start to rebuild Britain. Chinese online fashion company Shein has moved a little closer to floating on the London stock market. Reuters is reporting that Shein confidentially filed papers with Britain’s markets regulator in early June for a potential London listing, according to two sources. A Shein float would be one of the largest IPOs globally this year, as the company’s value has been estimated at £52bn. Shein had initially hoped to float on the US markets, but has now pivoted to London having faces many hurdles across the Atlantic as relations between Washington and Beijing have worsened. Taiwan’s manufacturers are having a bumper year, helped by strong demand for semiconductors from the AI sector. Taiwan’s industrial production growth rose to above 16.1%, year-on-year, in May, beating forecasts. This is the fastest growth since highest level since July 2021, which was affected by base effects from the pandemic. ING economist Lynn Song says: The strength of Taiwan’s industrial production has been concentrated in several sectors. Computers, electronics, and optical products (31.8% YoY) once again led the way in May for the second consecutive month, while electronic parts and components (29.3% YoY) also continued to outperform, driven by the semiconductor (41.0% YoY) subindex. Given semiconductors account for over a third of Taiwan’s total industrial production weight, the strong demand for semiconductors amid the AI boom has been a core pillar of the recent recovery of industrial activity. UK manufacturers are hoping for a “modest” rise in output over the next quarter. The latest industrial trends survey from the CBI has found that output volumes were broadly unchanged in the three months to June, leaving factory bosses expecting a slight pickup over the next three months. The long-running poll also found that total order books improved in June compared with May, but were still below normal. Less encouragingly, export order books were also seen as below normal and deteriorated relative to May. London Tunnels, a company that plans to turn Second World War tunnels in the UK capital into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the City. Instead, London Tunnels has decided to raise money by floating on the Amsterdam stock exchange. London Tunnels plans to restore the Kingsway Exchange Tunnels in Central London, originally built in the early 1940s, and designed to shelter people during the London Blitz. Back in January, it announced it intended to float on the London Stock Exchange, saying it was right that the tunnels – which it has agreed to buy – should be listed in London. But it has now dropped those plans in favour of an IPO on Amsterdam’s Euronext, in a blow to the capital’s public markets. London Tunnels hopes to raise £30m, and be valued at £130m. The float prospectus, though, warns that its plans could be delayed if it can’t get the full planning permission it needs to turn the tunnels into a tourist attraction that can accommodate three million visitors per year. Other risks include the possibility that it doesn’t manage to acquire the leasehold of the Tunnels, or that the “structural integrity of the Tunnels” may be affected by their age or other factors. Apple has been found to be in breach of sweeping new EU laws designed to allow smaller companies to compete and allow consumers to find cheaper and alternative apps in the tech business’s app store. The European Commission, which also acts as the EU antitrust and technology regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple following an investigation launched in March. In preliminary findings, against which Apple can appeal, the European Commission said it believed its rules of engagement did not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) “as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternatives channels for offers and content”. In addition, the commission has opened a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns its new contract terms for third-party app developers also fall short of the DMA’s requirements. More here: Back in the UK, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is warning that the UK’s public finances face a “toxic mix”, with debt at a 60-year high, taxes near an all-time high, and public services visibly struggling. In its analysis of the political parties manifestos, the IFS says spending on many public services will likely need to be cut over the next five years if government debt is not to ratchet ever upwards or unless taxes are increased further. The IFS say this is due to high debt interest costs, a growing welfare budget, and rising spending on health and defence. It accuses the two main parties of largely ignoring these raw facts. IFS director Paul Johnson explains: We need more efficient and effective public services. We need a government laser-focused on improving our economic performance. It’s good to see those facts acknowledged. But on the big issues over which governments have direct control - on how they will change tax, welfare, public spending - the manifestos of the main parties provide thin gruel indeed. On 4 July we will be voting in a knowledge vacuum. If - as is likely - growth forecasts are not revised up this autumn, we do not know whether the new government would stick roughly to the day-to-day and investment spending totals set out in the March Budget, or whether they would borrow more or tax more to top them up. If they were to stick to spending plans we do not know what would be cut. If taxes are to go up, we do not know which ones. We certainly don’t know how they would respond if things were to get worse. The choices in front of us are hard. High taxes, high debt, struggling public services, make them so. Pressures from health, defence, welfare, ageing will not make them easier. That is not a reason to hide the choices or to duck them. Quite the reverse. Yet hidden and ducked they have been. You can watch the IFS’s briefing here. Today’s Ifo business confidence survey shows that the German recovery is still stuttering, says Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. Brzeski explains: Germany’s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, dropped to 88.6 in June, from 89.3 in May. After three consecutive increases at the start of the year, business confidence has weakened again, illustrating that the cyclical bottoming out will not automatically be followed by a strong recovery. Today’s Ifo index weakening was exclusively driven by declining expectations, while the current assessment component remained unchanged, albeit at a low level. A strong rebound for this year remains highly unlikely, Brzeski fears, citing the Euros as an example: To some extent, since the start of the year, the German economy has gone through similar phases as the German national football team at the European Championships so far: too much enthusiasm about a good start to the tournament only because the years before had been miserable: a painful reality check in the first 89 minutes in the match last night against Switzerland, followed by a blast of euphoria after scoring in the very last minute. Euphoria after a draw, not after a win; it’s a new reality, both in German football and for its economy. Elsewhere in Europe, gloom is rising at German companies. German business morale has fallen this month, according to the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, whose business climate index has fallen to 88.6 points this month, down from 89.3 points in May. IFO reports that business expectations have weakened, at a time when Germany’s economy is struggling to overcome stagnation. The report found that factories are being hit by a fall in orders, an issue which is also hurting building firms. Clemens Fuest, president of the ifo Institute, explains: In manufacturing, the business climate declined after three rises in a row. Companies were again more skeptical for the months ahead. They were particularly concerned by the declining order backlog, but were somewhat more satisfied with current business. In the service sector, the index rose. Service providers assessed their situation more positively. The outlook for the second half-year also continued to brighten. Sentiment in the hotel sector, in particular, improved, while the hospitality sector expressed dissatisfaction. In trade, the business climate deteriorated considerably. Regarding expectations, skeptical sentiment increased markedly. Assessments of current business have been corrected downward. Both wholesalers and retailers were equally impacted by the negative development. In construction, the index rose slightly. This was thanks to less pessimistic expectations. However the current situation was assessed as worse. A lack of orders remains a core problem. Elsewhere, another day, another accusation by European regulators that Apple is breaking its tech rules, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, adding: This time the EU Commission said that Apple is breaching its rules because it does not allow customers of its App store to be steered to alternatives. Apple seems to be on a merry-go-round of EU regulatory scrutiny. It’s share price is up slightly in pre-market trading, however, the intense regulatory focus on Apple in recent years is one of the reasons why the stock is lagging the performance of other tech titans, and why it is the second weakest performer in the Magnificent 7 so far this year. Filomena Chirico, who leads the implementation of the Digital Markets Act, has posted that no company should feel it is above the law because they are “big and powerful, shiny and cool”. ‘Big’, ‘powerful’ and ‘shiny’ are fair enough, but ‘cool’? Brussels journalist Catherine Feore has doubts: Today is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the Digital Markets Act, declares Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy at the EC. Vestager says: Our preliminary position is that Apple does not fully allow steering. Steering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers’ app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers. We have also opened proceedings against Apple in relation to its so-called core technology fee and various rules for allowing third party app stores and sideloading. The developers’ community and consumers are eager to offer alternatives to the App Store. We will investigate to ensure Apple does not undermine these efforts. The European Commission’s latest concerns about Apple fall into two camps. The EC has informed Apple that it has taken a preliminary view that App Store rules breach the Digital Markets Act (DMA), as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content. The EC has opened a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns that its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app stores, including Apple’s new “Core Technology Fee”, do not comply with the DMA. On the first point, the EC says that Apple is making it hard for developers to tell customers about alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases. It says that none of Apple’s business terms allow developers to freely steer their customers, and that the fees charged by Apple when a developers acquires a new customer through the AppStore go beyond what is strictly necessary. On the second point, the EC will investigate whether Apple’s new contractual terms for developers comply with the DMA. It cites three concerns: Apple’s Core Technology Fee, under which developers of third-party app stores and third-party apps must pay a €0.50 fee per installed app. The Commission will investigate whether Apple has demonstrated that the fee structure that it has imposed, as part of the new business terms, and in particular the Core Technology Fee, effectively complies with the DMA. Apple’s multi-step user journey to download and install alternative app stores or apps on iPhones. The Commission will investigate whether the steps that a user has to undertake to successfully complete the download and installation of alternative app stores or apps, as well as the various information screens displayed by Apple to the user, comply with the DMA. The eligibility requirements for developers related to the ability to offer alternative app stores or directly distribute apps from the web on iPhones. The Commission will investigate whether these requirements, such as the ‘membership of good standing’ in the Apple Developer Program, that app developers have to meet in order to be able to benefit from alternative distribution provided for in the DMA comply with the DMA. You can read more here. Apple has said it had “made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission”. It added (via the FT): “We are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99 per cent of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created.” Newsflash: Brussels has accused Apple of restricting competition on its app store. European commissioner Thierry Breton has announced that the EU will take action against Apple under its new digital regulations, the Digital Markets Act. Posting on X, Breton says: For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies — denying consumers new opportunities &amp; choices. Today we are taking further steps to ensure AppStore &amp; iOS comply with the DMA. The EU are also investigating whether Apple’s developer fees breached the bloc’s rules, the Financial Times reports, adding: As part of the new probe into developer fees, Brussels said it was looking at whether Apple was imposing too many restrictions for users to download and install alternative app stores. Speaking of misery….the monthly mortgage of a first-time buyer has soared by more than 60% to exceed £1,000 a month since the last general election. That’s according to figures from Rightmove that underline the financial challenge facing Britons trying to gain a foothold on the housing ladder. Over the last five years, the average mortgage payment for a typical first-time buyer in Great Britain has risen by 61% to £1,075 a month, up from £667 in 2019, according to the property website Rightmove. The increase of about £400 a month is linked to the march of house prices and interest rates, which have heaped financial pressure on borrowers, whose average wages have grown by just 27% over the same period. The financial squeeze has forced many younger borrowers to either look for smaller properties or to take out an ultra-long mortgage. More here: Shares in Britvic have jumped 7% in early trading, after suiter Carlsberg removed one hurdle to a potential takeover. Carlsberg has told the City that drinks giant PepsiCo has agreed to waive the change of control clause in the bottling arrangements it has with Britvic. This waiver will come into effect if an acquisition of Britvic by Carlsberg proceeds to completion. Last Friday, Robinsons maker Britvic announced it has rejected two takeover approaches from Carlsberg, but a further bid is still possible. Currently, Britvic has a bottling agreement with PepsiCo giving it exclusive distribution and sales rights for all of the US company’s brands, including 7Up and Lipton Iced Tea, until 2040. But it includes a change-of-control clause that would allow PepsiCo to end the deal, making Britvic less attractive as a takeover target, The Sunday Times reported. Carlsberg says today that it is “considering its position”, adding “There can be no certainty that any offer will be made”. Britvic shares are up 7.3% at £11.74, having hit an alltime high this morning. Ouch indeed! Shares in SIG have tumbled 22% at the start of trading in London to a four-year low, after the building supplies firm’s profit warning this morning. A slowdown in demand across parts of Europe has hit UK building supplies firm SIG. SIG has warned shareholders this morning that profits will be well below expectations for this financial year, saying that market conditions have remained challenging. The company has blamed a slowdown in the French and German markets. Demand has also been weak in “the end markets of our UK Interiors business”, SIG adds, a sign that Britons may be cutting back on home improvement amid the cost of living squeeze. It adds: Whilst we continue to see more robust demand in our Poland, Ireland and UK Exteriors businesses, Group sales overall were weaker than expected in May and June to date. SIG now expects full year underlying operating profits of £20m-£30m, which is below the current analyst range of £36.7m to £43.0m. It hopes that sales will pick up in the second half of this yeara, but cautions: The extent of this improvement is subject to the evolution of demand conditions, particularly given market uncertainties in France and Germany, and recognising the sensitivity of operating profit to relatively small movements in sales. Mike Ashley has pulled off another retail deal. Ashley’s Frasers Group has struck a deal to buy a portfolio of luxury goods websites form UK e-commerce firm THG The two companies have also agreed a partnership across several areas including with THG Ingenuity, the online platform that serves third-party brands, and online sports nutrition brand Myprotein. Advertised salaries for UK jobs have fallen slightly for the first time since last autumn, according to new research which suggest the jobs market is weakening. Jobs site Adzuna reports this morning that the average salary being offered for advertised vacancies fell by 0.1% in May, on a monthly basis, to £38,765, down for the first time since last October. Adzuna says: While slightly weaker salaries could help relieve some of the tightness in the UK labour market, it may also suggest increasing vacancies for entry or junior-level roles with lower salaries. On an annual basis, salaries were 2.69% higher than in May 2023, following the rise in the National Living Wage to £11.44/hour at the start of April. The report also found that. vacancies were increasing for teachers but falling for nurses and healthcare staff. Andrew Hunter, co-founder of Adzuna, says: “Hopes that a return to growth in Q1 would result in greater confidence in hiring were not reflected in job vacancies in May, which remained essentially flat. However, there were slight increases in roles in Travel, Teaching and Manufacturing - areas where there have been some entrenched staff shortages. “The UK job market has been met with resistance in the past few months but the upcoming general election may have the potential to salvage the situation. Any outcome is likely to move the needle on the sluggish job market, with both the Conservative and Labour parties pledging to create more jobs. Sectors highlighted in their manifestos, such as Healthcare &amp; Nursing, Energy, Oil &amp; Gas, and Manufacturing, all experienced a vacancy drop of more than 20% year-on-year as of May 2024.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain’s Misery Index is tipped to rise later this year and through 2025, giving the next government an early headache. Unemployment is set to increase further, puncturing the boost from inflation having fallen back to normal levels this year. That means the Misery Index — dreamed up in the 1970s to capture the combined impact of unemployment and inflation on the population — is likely to worsen over the next 18 months. The UK unemployment rate has already risen to its highest level in two and a half years, at 4.4% in the February-April quarter. It is forecast to keep rising; the Bank of England estimates it will average 4.6% in the second quarter of 2025, and rise further to 4.8% in Q2 2026 and 2027. Bloomberg has calculated that this will push up the Misery Index to around 7.5 points over the first 18 months of the next government, up from six points at present. The Misery Index has been falling under Rishi Sunak’s premiership, having hit a painful 15 (the worst since the 1990s) under Liz Truss’s administration in autumn 2022, when inflation was a 40-year high. Andrew Oswald, a professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Warwick, told Bloomberg: “We still have quite strong underlying wage inflation, unemployment will have to rise to reestablish the equilibrium. “That will be much more painful than inflation has been.” Both major parties are promising to help working people, if they win next month’s election. Labour’s pledges include delivering a genuine living wage, updating trade union legislation, banning exploitative zero hour contracts and ending fire and rehire tactics. The Conservatives are promising another cut to national insurance rates, maintaining the National Living Wage at two-thirds of median earnings, and creating 100,000 more apprenticeships in England every year by the end of next Parliament. But without a pick-up in growth, economists fear unemployment will rise as firms lay off some of the staff they have been hoarding in recent years. As Hetal Mehta, head of economic research at St. James’s Place, put it: “Ten to fifteen years ago, if you said to people unemployment is going to be 5%, they would’ve said that’s a great outcome, but now we’re talking about unemployment rising from what was a much lower point. It will be a difficult message for any new government to manage.” More here: UK’s Next PM Faces Rise in Economic Misery Right After Election The agenda 9am BST: IFO German business climate index 10am BST: IFS to publish analysis of the General Election manifestos 11am BST: CBI industrial trends survey of UK manufacturing",

        "title": "London Tunnels moves IPO plan to Amsterdam in blow to UK markets",
        "content": "London Tunnels, which aims to convert an abandoned underground network into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the capital, instead opting to list in Amsterdam. The company aims to make the Kingsway exchange tunnels, a network of 8,000 sq metres under Holborn in central London, into a new attraction that will bring in 2 million visitors a year. The group revealed on Monday that it hoped to raise £30m by listing on Euronext Amsterdam, saying it could make the most of the size and scale of the equity and capital markets of Europe by listing in the Dutch capital. The decision comes after the company sent papers to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in January outlining its intention to float in the capital. At the time, its chief executive, Angus Murray, said: “This unique set of tunnels, owned by a British company, built by the British government, for the defence of Britain, that can further enhance London’s reputation as a leading tourist destination, should be listed in London.” The change of heart by the company is the latest blow to the LSE after a number of high-profile companies opted to list in Europe and the US ahead of London in recent months. In May, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, announced its decision to switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London. However, this has been partly offset by big players such as the fashion retail company Shein and Raspberry Pi announcing plans to list on the LSE. The Kingsway tunnels were built in the early 1940s to shelter up to 8,000 people during the blitz but were never used for this purpose. Instead, the Special Operations Executive, responsible for organising espionage and sabotage operations in German-occupied Europe, moved in during the final two years of the war and is thought to be the inspiration for the Q branch in Ian Fleming’s James Bond novels. The tunnels later housed the first secure transatlantic telephone cable, which ran a hotline that connected the White House and the Kremlin during the cold war, before ownership was transferred to British Telecom (BT) in 1981. London Tunnels has agreed to buy the site from BT next year and intends to open the attraction in 2027, including exhibits celebrating the history of the tunnels, as well as reinstating the city’s deepest London bar, which closed in the 1980s. However, the float prospectus lists a number of risk factors to the project, including the warning that plans could be delayed if it cannot get the full planning permission it needs. Last month, it secured the planning green light from the City of London Corporation but is still awaiting planning signoff from the London borough of Camden. The list also includes risks around whether the structural integrity of the tunnels is affected by their age, the possibility that the removal of asbestos from the tunnels may take longer than expected, and that the company may be unable to complete the acquisition of the leasehold on the agreed date of 30 June next year. Explaining its decision for moving the listing, London Tunnels said it could meet the £20m to £30m needed over the first few years of development. It added that it would then look to raise a further £120m in debt and equity to make the tunnels operational.",

        "title": "Boeing should face criminal charges, say US prosecutors – reports",
        "content": "Boeing is reportedly facing the prospect of criminal charges after US prosecutors reportedly told the Department of Justice (DoJ) that the US manufacturer had violated a settlement related to two fatal crashes of the 737 Max plane. The DoJ’s leaders have until 7 July to decide whether it intends to file criminal charges against Boeing after prosecutors on the case recommended them, according to Reuters and CBS News. The DoJ last month told a federal court in Texas that Boeing had violated the terms of a 2021 settlement in which it agreed to pay $2.5bn (£2bn) in penalties and compensation to airline customers and families of those who died in two fatal crashes. Boeing failed to “design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics programme to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations”, according to the court filing. New criminal charges would be the latest round of recriminations from the two crashes. A total of 346 passengers died in the crashes of Boeing 737 Maxes operated by Indonesia’s Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines in late 2018 and early 2019. The crashes prompted the greatest crisis in the company’s history, forcing the worldwide grounding of Boeing’s bestselling aircraft for nearly two years. The crashes were caused by a new design that – unbeknown to pilots – dipped the nose of the planes automatically to compensate for shifting larger engines forwards. The system, known as manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system (MCAS), left the planes vulnerable if a single sensor failed. The deferred prosecution agreement protected the company from a fraud charge related to its alleged concealment of information from aviation regulators over how the system worked. At the time of the settlement, the DoJ said: “Boeing’s employees chose the path of profit over candour.” The agreement was meant to end in January, which would have removed one element of uncertainty for the company. It faces renewed scrutiny of its safety record after an incident two days before the settlement expired when a door panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines plane in mid-air. Reuters reported that the final decision to go ahead with new charges had not been made. One source said Boeing could face new charges going beyond the original 2021 fraud conspiracy charge. Under the terms of the settlement, the DoJ also has the option of extending it by a year or proposing new, stricter terms. The New York Times previously reported that Boeing could avoid criminal prosecution. New charges would also cast a shadow over the last months in post of the chief executive, Dave Calhoun, who will retire later this year after a term dominated by the aftermath of the crashes. In testimony to the US Senate last week, Calhoun acknowledged that “something went wrong” at the company after whistleblowers allegedly faced retaliation for raising concerns about safety problems in factories. Boeing declined to comment. The DoJ declined to comment when contacted by Reuters and CBS News.",

        "content": "Mike Ashley’s Frasers has bought luxury goods websites from THG in a deal that will also include selling the online health and beauty retailer’s protein powder in Sports Direct shops. THG on Monday said it had sold sites including Coggles to Frasers as part of a partnership deal that also includes Frasers using THG’s technology in some parts of its business. The deal is Mike Ashley’s latest acquisition in an effort over several years to shift his retail group’s focus away from Sports Direct towards more premium brands, including the House of Fraser department store and the luxury clothing retailer Flannels. Sports Direct still accounts for half the company’s sales. For THG, the deal will bring in a new customer for its retail website technology, as well as providing an outlet for its products, including its Myprotein brand, in Sports Direct stores. Frasers will use THG for management of couriers and running its Australian delivery operations. THG has struggled to live up to its billing as a tech company when its shares floated on the London Stock Exchange. Its shares initially jumped to a valuation of £5.6bn when they were first listed in September 2020. However, since then the company’s market value has fallen to about £800m. The company is led by Matthew Moulding, whose 15% holding briefly made him a billionaire on paper. His shares were worth £123m at the end of last week, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. When Moulding started the company it initially sold CDs tax-free online, but shifted to running websites for other retailers. However, its direct-to-consumer retail operations are still a crucial part of its revenues. THG its the luxury division had sales of about £43m in the 2023 financial year and nearly made a profit “despite a broader challenging luxury market”. The Coggles brand, started in 1974 as Sarah Coggle, sells men’s and women’s clothing, shoes and home products. Frasers has a long history of snapping up struggling sports and clothing retail brands. Purchases in recent years have included the clothing brand Jack Wills, the suit maker Gieves &amp; Hawkes, Evans Cycles, the video game store Game and the fast-fashion brands Missguided and I Saw it First. In March, Frasers put another luxury retail brand, Matchesfashion, into administration three months after buying it. Frasers said it was unwilling to fund a turnaround.",

        "title": "John Lewis clothing range aims to ‘minimise waste and maximise longevity’",
        "content": "Fabric that shrinks or bobbles is a pet peeve of Britons who want to buy long-lasting clothes, with the low quality of high street fashion contributing to the 30,000 shipping containers of clothing and homewares dumped by consumers every year. With retailers tasked with finding ways to reduce the environmental impact of the clothing they sell, the first wave of products in a new range especially designed to “minimise waste and maximise longevity” has gone on sale at John Lewis. The 20-strong “circular” collection is “just the beginning” of an overhaul that by 2028 will reach thousands of products, the department store chain says. Described as products that will “stand the test of time”, the initial range includes pyjamas, babywear, knitwear, mattresses, duvets and pillows. Textiles and fashion are responsible for up to 10% of global carbon emissions, and despite growing awareness, the UK consumes more clothes per head than any other country in Europe. Almost half (45%) of UK citizens buy clothing at least once a month, while one in four (23%) still regularly buy clothing with the intention of using it for a short amount of time. The result of this is that, on average, each person in the UK throws 35 items of unwanted textiles straight into general waste every year, according to anti-waste charity Wrap’s 2024 textiles market situation report. It estimates that 711,000 tonnes of textiles are put into black bins or general waste skips at recycling centres, a volume that equates to almost 30,000 shipping containers full of cast-off fashion and home textiles items a year. At the same time, Wrap warns that the textiles that do get donated responsibly have plummeted in price due to the saturation of the market with low-quality fast fashion, resulting in less income for the reuse and recycling sectors. More thoughtful design can help manage the fallout from this consumption, with up to 80% of a piece of clothing’s impact determined at the design phase, says Wrap. It is championing circular design, which involves using recycled or sustainable materials and creating durability by, for example, using stronger stitching for seams. In keeping with this philosophy, products in the John Lewis range have an increased amount of recycled content. The jumper, albeit with a hefty £135 price tag, is made with Sustainable Fibre Alliance (SFA) certified cashmere. The £8.50 sleepsuit is, it says, made to be passed on, after being tested to higher durability standards. Kathleen Mitchell, the store’s commercial director, said it was looking at ways to “combine style and sustainability” for its customers. “We know they want products that look good and that last, and that’s exactly what these designs offer,” she said. Circular design also factors in how clothing can be more easily recycled when the owner has finished with it. This means restricting the number of fabrics used. In the pyjamas, for example, an elastic waistband has been replaced with a simple fabric tie.",

        "title": "China-owned British Steel said to have requested £600m of taxpayer support",
        "content": "Chinese-owned British Steel has reportedly submitted a request for a package of taxpayer support worth £600m as it looks for assistance from the next government to upgrade to less polluting technology. Government officials are due to review plans that set out the costs of switching from blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces at the company’s steelworks in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, the Sunday Times reported. The steel industry is one of the UK industries that could be most affected by a change of government at the general election. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who is heavily favoured in polls to be the next prime minister, has stuck to a pledge to invest £3bn in decarbonising the steel industry despite rowing back on other environmental spending plans. Ministers will have the final say over any support for British Steel after the election. Any deal is likely to receive close scrutiny because of the Chinese ownership. China produces more than half of global steel, and has previously been accused of dumping steel in other countries to win market share. Ministers in the new government would also have final say on whether an already agreed £500m subsidy for Indian-owned Tata Steel would go ahead. Rishi Sunak’s government agreed the deal with Tata to switch production at Port Talbot in south Wales from two blast furnaces to a single electric arc furnace. If Labour wins power, it is understood the UK’s ability to make steel from iron ore, known as primary steelmaking, would be an important consideration when deciding support for individual companies, although it is also keen for private sector companies to invest alongside. The shadow business minister, Jonathan Reynolds, has described primary steelmaking as a “sovereign capability” because of its role in building nuclear submarines and wind turbines. British Steel has struggled financially since being rescued from collapse in March 2020 by China’s Jingye. Auditors for the company in January warned the business, which employs 4,500 workers, faced “material uncertainty” over its future. British Steel in November announced plans to close its two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe and replace them with much cleaner electric arc furnaces at Scunthorpe and Redcar, in North Yorkshire. The plans could eventually mean 2,000 job losses, because electric arc furnaces require far fewer workers. Tata is also planning to make as many as 2,800 workers redundant in the switch to electric technology. It has claimed that any attempt by Labour to renegotiate the terms of the deal could put steelmaking in Port Talbot at risk. Alasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary of Community, a steelworkers’ union, said Labour’s £3bn investment could be a “gamechanger” for the industry. “We need the next government to recognise the vital importance of the steel industry to our economy and national security, and to show ambition for the future of the sector,” he said. “That’s something which has been dismally lacking over recent years, as epitomised by the bargain basement plan Rishi Sunak signed off with Tata – a proposal which would remove Britain’s primary steelmaking capacity and leave the country reliant on dirty steel imports from overseas.” Neither the plans from Tata Steel nor British Steel would, as they stand, preserve the UK’s ability to produce steel from iron ore, as now happens in Britain’s remaining blast furnaces. The companies plan to feed scrap steel into electric arc furnaces to melt the metal down. One option for producing near-zero-emissions steel is making direct reduced iron (DRI). The DRI process removes oxygen from iron ore using gas. If green hydrogen is used no carbon is released into the atmosphere, and the iron can be used in an electric arc furnace. However, neither Tata nor British Steel are thought likely to consider investing in a DRI plant without major government support. The companies have previously argued that their loss-making operations make it difficult to invest without this. A DRI plant could cost as much as £1bn to build, according to some industry estimates.
