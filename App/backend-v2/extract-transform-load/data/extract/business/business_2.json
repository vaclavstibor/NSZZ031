        "title": "Australia’s inflation rises to 4%, stoking concern interest rates could increase again",
        "content": "Australia’s monthly inflation rate increased to its highest level in 2024 in the latest indication that the Reserve Bank won’t be cutting interest rates soon and might yet hike again. Consumer prices rose 4% last month from a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That compared with the 3.6% pace recorded for April, and the 3.8% rate expected for May by economists. The jump in May’s inflation was propelled in part by automotive fuel prices, which were up 9.3% from a year earlier even as they retreated 5.1% during the month itself. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Electricity prices were also up 6.5% from a year ago, quickening from April’s 4.2% pace. Without the federal and state rebates, power prices would have been 14.5% higher. Food presented a mixed price picture. Overall prices were up 3.3% from May 2023, a slowdown from April’s 3.8% pace. Fruit and vegetable prices, though, climbed 4.4% compared with May 2023, continuing a recent rebound after prices posted a 1.2% drop in March. Housing costs were 5.2% higher than in May 2023, with rents up 7.4%, reflecting the low vacancy rates in many cities. Of particular concern will be the acceleration of the trimmed mean measure of inflation, which is what the RBA looks at more closely than the “headline” CPI figure. That jumped to 4.4% from 4.1% in April and 4% in March. The monthly inflation figures are less complete than the quarterly ones, which won’t land until 31 July. The RBA expects the quarterly inflation pace will accelerate to 3.8% in the April-June period from 3.6% in the March quarter. The monthly consumer price index peaked in December 2022 at 8.4%, a three-decade high, as post-Covid government stimulus combined with higher global energy prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Urkaine. The RBA has said it won’t hesitate to raise its key interest rate – for a 14th time in this cycle – if it loses confidence that inflation can fall back within its 2%-3% target by the end of next year. The federal budget, released earlier this month, forecast price increases could slow to 3% or less by the end of 2024. It is banking on energy rebates and other measures to “mechanically” lower the CPI even as the stage-three cuts inject more than $20bn into the economy this coming financial year. The Australian dollar jumped about US0.2 cents to almost US66.7 in the wake of the inflation figures as investors shifted their bets about interest rates. Stocks also shed about 0.3 percentage points, before paring the losses to be down about 0.75% for the day. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said inflation was “higher than we would like”, and much lower than 6.1% when Labor took office in May 2022. “We’ve seen around the world that inflation can zig and zag on its way down, it doesn’t always moderate in a straight line and the last mile can be a bit harder,” Chalmers said. His shadow counterpart Angus Taylor said the inflation outcome was “shocking but not surprising”. “This is what happens when you have a big spending Labor government that’s completely out of touch with the economic reality,” Taylor said. “We’ve now had four months in a row of accelerating core inflation. This will no doubt be of concern to the independent Reserve Bank.” However, Steve Mickenbecker, an executive with Canstar, said the monthly inflation pop was “staggering”, confirming that inflation was not on the downward trajectory sought by the RBA. The RBA will “surely lift rates” when its board meets in on 5-6 August because “the risk of baked-in inflationary expectations is too high”, Mickenbecker said. “It’s worrying news for borrowers with an increase of 0.25 [percentage point] adding $100 to the monthly repayment on a $600,000 loan over 30 years,” he said. “Even without a rate increase, a three-month extension before a rate cut adds $288 in extra repayments to the same loan.” David Bassanese, chief economist with Betashares, said the monthly CPI was a “shocker” that placed “huge pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates in August”. “For the RBA, the concern remains that the longer inflation stays high, the greater the risk of it becoming embedded into inflation expectations and ongoing wage and price setting behaviour – particularly given the economy, despite weak growth, is still operating at a high level of capacity,” Bassanese said. Prior to today’s figures all of the big four commercial banks – save ANZ – were forecasting the RBA would cut its cash rate in November. ANZ earlier this month broke ranks to predict the first rate cut wouldn’t happen until February 2025.",

        "title": "Rivian shares surge after Volkswagen agrees to $5bn investment",
        "content": "Shares in Rivian surged after Volkswagen agreed to invest up to $5bn in the Amazon-backed electric carmaker. Volkswagen will initially invest $1bn as part of a partnership with Rivian to form a new, equally controlled joint venture to share electric vehicle architecture and software, the companies said on Tuesday. On Wall Street, shares in Rivian’s stock jumped 33% when trading began on Wednesday following the announcement. The deal amounts to a significant win for Rivian, which is grappling with steep losses as it attempts to ramp up production of its electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. While EV startups have been dealing with a slowdown in demand amid high interest rates and dwindling cash, traditional automakers have struggled to build battery-powered vehicles and advanced software. The partnership between Rivian and Volkswagen will help Volkswagen accelerate its plans to develop software-defined vehicles (SDV), with Rivian licensing its existing intellectual property rights to the joint venture. The investment will provide Rivian – known for its flagship R1S SUVs and R1T pickups – the funding it needs to develop its less-expensive and smaller R2 SUVs that will roll out in 2026, the founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe, told Reuters. Scaringe said the investment was “expected to help secure our capital needs for substantial growth”. “Since the earliest days of Rivian, we have been focused on developing highly differentiated technology, and it’s exciting that one of the world’s largest and most respected automotive companies has recognized this,” Scaringe added. Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen Group, said: “Through our cooperation, we will bring the best solutions to our vehicles faster and at lower cost … We are strengthening our technology profile and our competitiveness.” Reuters contributed reporting",

        "title": "Nvidia shares open higher after $500bn sell-off; Microsoft hit with EU antitrust charge over Teams – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up…. Shares in Nvidia have jumped 3% in early trading, as the AI chipmaker recovers some ground after three days of big losses. Today’s rally lifts Nvidia’s value by around $90bn, back to almost $3trn. Over half a trillion dollars had been knocked off Nvidia’s value in recent days, before today’s tentative recovery, shortly after it became the world’s largest company last week. Brussels has accused Microsoft of anti-competitive behaviour by bundling its Teams app with its Office suite, potentially teeing up a large fine for the software giant: US consumer morale has dropped this month, a new survey shows, but was stronger than expected. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dipped in June to 100.4, down from 101.3 in May. Economists had expected it would fall more, to exactly 100. The decline was due to a deteriorating short-term outlook for income, business, and conditions in the jobs market. Dana M. Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, explains: “Confidence pulled back in June but remained within the same narrow range that’s held throughout the past two years, as strength in current labor market views continued to outweigh concerns about the future. However, if material weaknesses in the labor market appear, Confidence could weaken as the year progresses.” Microsoft’s stock is shrugging off today’s accusations from Brussels that it broke EU competition rules by bundling its Teams app with its Office suit. Shares in Microsoft are up 0.1% in morning trading in New York, at $448.15. Nvidia’s recovery is helping to lift the tech sector. The Nasdaq Composite index has gained 95 points, or 0.56%, to 17,592 points The broader S&amp;P 500 index is up 0.2%, with Nvidia the fourth highest riser. Cruise operator Carnival is leading the charge, after lifting its annual profit forecast today. The Dow Jones industrial average, of 30 large US companies, has dipped by 0.27% to 39,304 points, with Apple (+0.9%), Amazon (+0.7%) and Salesforce (+0.9%) among the risers. Ding Ding goes the Wall Street opening bell….. and Nvidia shares have opened higher. Nvidia has jumped 2.8% in early trading, to $121.46, up from $118 last night, after losing over $500bn in a dramatic tumble over the last three sesssions. As flagged this morning, technical analysts had indicated that Nvidia’s shares could have support at $115. They hit an alltime high of $140 last week, when Nvidia surged to become the world’s most valuable company, before starting to lose ground on Thursday. HSBC and Barclays are cutting rates on their fixed mortgage deals in what some brokers claim could be the start of a “summer of savings” for homebuyers and those looking to remortgage. Barclays has reduced rates by more than 0.25 percentage points in some cases from Tuesday, and its cuts led to a quick response from HSBC, which said it would be cutting rates across its home loans range with effect from Wednesday. While new home loan rates have been broadly stable over the last month or two, the pricing of some deals has crept up. However, recent improvements to money market swap rates – which largely determine the pricing of new fixed deals – appear to have prompted two of the biggest mortgage lenders to reduce their rates, with others predicted to follow suit. More here: With less than 30 minutes to go until Wall Street opens, Nvidia is still on track for a small recovery. Shares in Nvidia are on track to open almost 3% higher, at $121.60, which would recover nearly half of Monday’s losses. Over in Canada, inflation has jumped unexpectedly. Consumer prices across the Canadian economy rose by 2.9% in the year to May, up from 2.7% in April, dashing hopes of a small fall. This may be slightly awkward for the Bank of Canada, which cut interest rates earlier this month. Statistics Canada said the increase was due to higher prices for services, which rose 4.6% in May following a 4.2% increase in April. Faster price growth for services was led by cellular services, travel tours, rent and air transportation. Prices for goods (+1.0%) grew at the same rate as in April. Human rights organisation Amnesty International has hit out at plans for China’s fast fashion group Shein to float on the London Stock Exchange. It emerged yesterday that Shein has confidentially filed for a public listing in London, which could value the company at around £50bn. This would be London’s biggest ever float. But Dominique Muller, Amnesty International researcher specialising in the garment industry, says the City should demand transparent and binding safeguards regarding human rights standards, before admitting Shein to the fold: “It’s deeply troubling that a company with questionable labour and human rights standards and an unsustainable fast fashion business model could be set to reap hundreds of millions of pounds via a sale of shares and a listing on the London Stock Exchange. “Where SHEIN goes, others will try to follow. The UK authorities and the London Stock Exchange should not facilitate SHEIN’s listing until transparent and binding safeguards regarding internationally accepted human rights standards covering its entire supply chain are agreed and applied, and any abuses identified fully remedied. “Rewarding SHEIN’s current methods via a flotation would be a badge of shame for the London Stock Exchange, the bankers helping bring it to market, and any investors set to profit from it. It would be an appalling example of a process which delivers for the rich by squeezing the poor. It validates the view that it is acceptable to regard workers and their rights, company products and the environment as expendable – which cheapens us all. “It is essential the new UK government does not allow a race to the bottom in terms of corporate and human rights standards. It should require companies to prevent serious environmental harms and human rights abuses occurring throughout their entire operations and supply chains. It should enable workers whose rights are abused by company activities anywhere in the world recourse to justice through UK courts.” Shein has been accused of using forced labour to make its affordable clothing, such as t-shirts and sweaters. The Mail on Sunday reported last weekend that Shein may scrap its London float plans, amid growing disquiet in Beijing over the way the fast-fashion retailer is portrayed in the UK. A US central bank policymaker has indicated she would be open to raising interest rates if inflation not fall as hoped. In a speech in London today, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman also said the time is not right yet to start lowering borrowing costs. Bowman explained: Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2% goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Last month, US consumer price inflation fell to an annual rate of 3.3%, down from 3.4% in April. The owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands has warned its car plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton could close unless market demand for electric vehicles and “stupid” regulatory conditions change. The UK managing director of Stellantis said the company did not want to shut operations in the UK but it would make a decision in “less than a year” in the face of unreasonable government sales quotas and lack of consumer incentives in relation to VAT on vehicles and electricity. Maria Grazia Davino said today: “You have to make strategies that are based on efficiency. I want to keep the production [in the] UK and I want to be clear on this.” She added that the demand for electric vehicles was “soft” and unless there were further incentives for businesses to buy the electric commercial vehicles or more support from the government it may have no choice. Burrito chain Tortilla has bought its biggest European competitor in a deal worth nearly £4m, PA Media reports, as it hopes to attract new consumers on the go, ahead of the Paris Olympics. Tortilla is buying 13 restaurants from rival Fresh Burritos, in prime locations in Paris and other cities in France. The acquisition also includes a network of 19 franchised locations and the rights to the brand. The London-based company, which has 89 stores, predominantly in the UK, said the purchase will give it a “launchpad” to expand further into Europe. It says: “Tortilla’s international ambitions are no secret, and acquiring Fresh Burritos is our gateway to mainland Europe. “With Mexican cuisine surging in popularity, these prime French locations give us a solid launchpad.” Tesla is recalling more than 11,000 Cybertruck electric vehicles, due to problems with the windscreen wiper motor and the trunk bed trim seal, Marketwatch reports: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration acknowledged Tesla’s TSLA notification of both matters in letters dated Monday. The wiper issue potentially impacts 11,688 2024 Cybertruck units, while the trunk-bed trim issue could affect 11,383 units of the 2024 model. The recalls are the latest setback for the vehicle whose mass production is expected to start next year, points out Reuters: Microsoft president Brad Smith has responded to the EC’s statement of objections about Teams bundling, saying: “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission’s remaining concerns.” Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of EC competition policy, says: We are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses. And preserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets. If confirmed, Microsoft’s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules. Microsoft now has the opportunity to reply to our concerns. Microsoft faces a hefty antitrust fine if the EC’s charges over Teams bundling are upheld, points out Reuters. It risks a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual turnover if it is found guilty of the antitrust breaches announced today. Reuters adds: Two decades after Microsoft’s last EU fine, the EU competition watchdog’s latest action was triggered by a 2020 complaint from rival workspace messaging app Slack, owned by Salesforce. The U.S. tech giant had to pay €2.2bn ($2.4 billion) in EU antitrust fines two decades ago for tying, or bundling, two or more products together. Big tech news from Brussels: Microsoft has been accused of anti-competitive behaviour by the European Commission for bundling its Teams app with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites. The EC says it is concerned that, since at least April 2019, Microsoft has been tying Teams with its core software-as-a-service (SaaS) productivity applications. This, it fears, has restricted competition on the market for communication and collaboration products and defending its market position in productivity software and its suites-centric model from competing suppliers of individual software. The Commission explains: In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications. This advantage may have been further exacerbated by interoperability limitations between Teams‘ competitors and Microsoft’s offerings. The conduct may have prevented Teams’ rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area. If confirmed, these practices would infringe Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’), which prohibits the abuse of a dominant market position. Today’s Statement of Objections comes almost a year after the EC launched an antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s bundling of its Teams video and chat app with some of its other products. The Commission says that after it began its investigation, Microsoft introduced changes in the way it distributes Teams, and started offering some suites without Teams. However, the Commission has preliminarily found that these changes are insufficient to address its concerns and that “more changes to Microsoft’s conduct are necessary to restore competition”. Whoever wins next week’s general election will benefit from an improving economic climate, predicts Capital Economics. They predict that interest rates will fall faster than forecast over the next 18 months, while economic growth will be pacier. Capital Economics say: The next government, which the polls ahead of the election on 4th July suggest will be a Labour one, will benefit from a combination of lower inflation, lower interest rates and faster economic growth than most are expecting. We think that a fall in CPI inflation from 2.0% in May to around 1.5% by the end of this year will prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates from 5.25% to 3.00% next year, rather than to 4.00% as investors expect. And the boost to activity from lower inflation and interest rates explains why we are more optimistic than most by expecting the economy to grow by 1.0% this year and 1.5% in both 2025 and 2026. While tax revenues and public spending may both be a bit higher under a Labour government, the economy will probably tread a similar path over the next couple of years. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, explained last weekend that the economy Labour will (probably) take on is not quite as ravaged as some suggest…. The use of artificial intelligence to revolutionise scientific research and disease understanding is one of the top ten emerging technologies of this year. So says the World Economic Forum, in a new report that highlights groundbreaking innovations that can tackle critical global challenges within the next 3 to 5 years. WEF’s Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2024 are: AI for scientific discovery: While artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in research for many years, advances in deep learning, generative AI and foundation models are revolutionizing the scientific discovery process. AI will enable researchers to make unprecedented connections and advancements in understanding diseases, proposing new materials, and enhancing knowledge of the human body and mind. Privacy-enhancing technologies: Protecting personal privacy while providing new opportunities for global data sharing and collaboration, “synthetic data” is set to transform how information is handled with powerful applications in health-related research. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces: These innovative surfaces turn ordinary walls and surfaces into intelligent components for wireless communication while enhancing energy efficiency in wireless networks. They hold promise for numerous applications, from smart factories to vehicular networks. High-altitude platform stations: Using aircraft, blimps and balloons, these systems can extend mobile network access to remote regions, helping bridge the digital divide for over 2.6 billion people worldwide. Integrated sensing and communication: The advent of 6G networks facilitates simultaneous data collection (sensing) and transmission (communication). This enables environmental monitoring systems that help in smart agriculture, environmental conservation and urban planning. Integrated sensing and communication devices also promise to reduce energy and silicon consumption. Immersive technology for the built world: Combining computing power with virtual and augmented reality, these technologies promise rapid improvements in infrastructure and daily systems. This technology allows designers and construction professionals to check for correspondence between physical and digital models, ensuring accuracy and safety and advancing sustainability. Elastocalorics: As global temperatures rise, the need for cooling solutions is set to soar. Offering higher efficiency and lower energy use, elastocalorics release and absorb heat under mechanical stress, presenting a sustainable alternative to current technologies. Carbon-capturing microbes: Engineered organisms convert emissions into valuable products like biofuels, providing a promising approach to mitigating climate change. Alternative livestock feeds: protein feeds for livestock sourced from single-cell proteins, algae and food waste could offer a sustainable solution for the agricultural industry. Genomics for transplants: The successful implantation of genetically engineered organs into a human marks a significant advancement in healthcare, offering hope to millions awaiting transplants. Here’s the full report. Most Nvidia shareholders will still be in profit despite the 16% drop over the last few days (as it is up 2,700% over the last five years!). Neil Roarty, analyst at investment platform Stocklytics, says: “A week ago Nvidia was celebrating becoming the most valuable company in the world; now it’s licking its wounds on what some are describing as the biggest bloodbath in investor history, with more than half a trillion dollars wiped off in a matter of days. “Even against this backdrop, there may still be reasons for optimism. The surge in Nvidia share price has been so remarkable throughout 2024 that most investors are still in the black. Indeed, profit-taking looks to be a key factor for the adjustment; even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been selling stock. “The fundamentals behind Nvidia’s growth remain the same. If you believe that the AI technology its chips are powering will completely recalibrate the global economy - and many do - then a $3 trillion market cap suddenly looks considerably more reasonable.” Banking news: the UK government’s stake in NatWest has dipped below 21%. Due to sales as part of the ongoing trading plan, the government reduced its shareholding in NatWest to 20.92%, it has told the City. Back in April 2023, the stake was 42%, down from around 84% at its peak, but has been whittled down as the government returned shares to the markets. Plans for a sale of the government’s stake in NatWest to the general public have been disrupted by the general election, but that hasn’t stopped the shareholding being steadily trimmed…. In the UK retail sector, supermarket chain Morrisons has reported a pick-up in sales. Morrisons’ like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, rose 4.1% in the three months from 29 January to 28 April. Total sales (ex-fuel) jumped 3.7% to £3.8bn. Jo Goff, chief financial officer, says: “This has been another solid quarter of progress with sales and volume improvements right across the business. Our debt has now reduced by over a third and we made further progress on our cost savings programme with £78m delivered in the quarter, taking the total since the start of this year to just over £450m, in line with our £700 million three year target.” Last year, Morrisons made a loss of more than £1bn after a debt-fuelled private equity takeover in 2021. Back in the future’s market…. Nvidia’s shares price is now rallying! It’s currently up 2.5% in pre-market trading, at $121, having initially been on track for a 2% fall. Wall Street opens at 2.30pm UK time (or 9.30am in New York), so we’ll see if it can hang onto these gains….. Nvidia’s stonking share price rise over the last couple of years was partly driven by fear of missing out, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. This phenomenon can work in reverse too, Mould points out: “Admittedly, a near-7% decline in Nvidia. [yesterday] might have sounded the alarm bells that we’re seeing a shift in the market. It’s important to remember that stocks don’t always travel in a straight line and there is a herd mentality with big-name companies on the market. “When everyone was piling into Nvidia, it created a sense of FOMO – fear of missing out – so others followed suit and bid up the shares even further. The same works in reverse, where a bout of selling can be exacerbated by others following the crowd and panicking. “Quite a few institutional investors have been suggesting in recent months that US markets were looking a bit toppy. When everything is racing ahead it is time to take a hard look at a portfolio and think about what could go wrong as well as what could go right. The higher the big tech stocks rise, the greater the potential fall if markets turn. Nvidia’s selloff over the last few days has not, yet, spooked the wider markets. Derren Nathan, equity research analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: “Nvidia has had another stumble slipping further away from the position it held briefly as the world’s most valuable company. But contrary to recent noise, markets are about more than just one stock. After several days of declines, yesterday saw the chipmaker’s stock lose over 6%, shedding some $200bn from its market value. But to put things in context, the shares have still gained 190% on a 12-month view, so it’s no surprise some investors are locking in some profits, including CEO Jensen Huang who is reported to have sold around $95mn of stock in recent days. But although NVIDIA has sneezed, the wider market hasn’t caught a cold with a mixture of less extreme movements in both directions for the rest of the magnificent 7 [tech giants Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta]. Meanwhile, in other sectors US stocks saw gains in energy, financials and utilities: a vote of confidence by investors in the health of the broader economy. Nvidia’s shares are on track for further losses when Wall Street opens in five and a half hours time. Pre-market trading has just opened, and they’re down 2.1% at $115.64, on track for a fourth day of losses, pulling Nvidia deeper into a correction. That would leave its shares slightly above the short-term support level identified by traders (see earlier post). Airbus’s woes have hit UK aerospace manufacturers. Rolls-Royce, which makes and maintains jet engines, are down 3.3% in London, while Melrose, which produces engine components, are down 3.7%. Elsewhere in the markets, European aerospace giant Airbus has tumbled 9% this morning after cutting its profit forecasts last night. Investors are ditching Airbus after it warned of persistent supply chain disruptions and challenges in its space business last night. Airbus now expects to make around 770 commercial jets this year, down from a previous target of 800, saying: In commercial aircraft, Airbus is facing persistent specific supply chain issues mainly in engines, aerostructures and cabin equipment. Airbus is also taking a €900m charge at its Space Systems, after discovering “further commercial and technical” challenges. It adds: These are mainly related to updated assumptions on schedules, workload, sourcing, risks and costs over the lifetime of certain telecommunications, navigation and observation programmes. European chip stocks are feeling a chill from Nvidia. ASML Holding, the Netherlands firm which makes machines to produce semiconductors, are down 2.7% this morning. Another Dutch chip equipment maker, BE semiconductor Industries, are down 2.5%. They had both enjoyed strong gains in the last 12 months. The drop in chipmakers such as Nvidia may show that a 'rotation’ has begun in the US stock markets, with money moving away from the mega cap technology stocks which have been a major driver of gains this year. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says: The stellar rise of tech and AI-related stocks in particular inevitably gets to the stage where investors pause for breath and recalculate valuation levels. Over recent days the more traditional Dow Jones index has been the subject of buying interest at the expense of the more tech exposed S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq indices, as investors seek alternatives such as financials and utilities, and more broadly in value stocks which have been left behind by the tech surge. After two weaker trading sessions, market darling Nvidia fell a further 6.7% while other chip stocks such as Broadcom and Qualcomm fell between 3% and 6%. While it is far too early to call an end to the current run, such minor corrections are generally seen as healthy, while the expected downward direction of travel for interest rates provides a comforting backdrop as companies more broadly are comfortable to borrow to grow their businesses. The drop in Nvidia’s share price in the last three sessions will be painful for investors who had bought call options in the chipmaker. Call options give the right (but not the obligation) to buy a stock in future at a fixed price. There had been booming interest in call options in Nvidia, which paid out if its stock kept rising – a profitable trade, until the last few trading sessions. The biggest profits were to be made in buying ‘out of the money’ Nvidia call options, which would only pay off it its stock climbed sharply higher. Arguably those call options helped to drive up stocks too, as traders who had written the option could protect themselves by buying the underlying share, just in case they rose above the ‘strike price’ (when the option is then ‘in the money’) It’s important to remember that Nvidia is an extremely volatile stock. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, explains: The chart below shows Nvidia 1-month call option volatility and the Vix (green line). The calm Vix index hides the fact that the second-best performer on the index is extremely volatile. As we have said before, Nvidia does experience periods of extreme volatility, both to the upside and to the downside. If you own this stock, you need to make peace with that. But the other issue is that Nvidia’s stock was looking a little pricy. Brooks writes: Not even the stock split earlier this month has dampened down Nvidia’s stock price volatility. Analysts have upgraded their forecasts for their Q2 earnings in the last 4 weeks, however, with a 12-month forward P/E ratio of 42, higher than the average for the S&amp;P 500 of 25.6, there is no denying that Nvidia is starting to look a bit rich. While we don’t deny that Nvidia is delivering on the earnings front: it is expected to deliver $28bn of revenue in Q3, and operating profits of $18.5bn, investors must pay up for these earnings. Thus, there is less room for Nvidia to slip up when it delivers its earnings reports, which may worry some investors. Tech is a multiyear theme, especially Artificial Intelligence, thus we do not expect Nvidia’s stock price to fall off a cliff, but a pullback is to be expected. Added to this, it is normal for investors to pause and consider if a stock is looking overvalued, even a stock like Nvidia. After a three-day slide, financial traders are wondering how much further Nvidia’s shares may fall. Bloomberg reports that traders are turning to technical analysis for clues on where the bottom may be. Yesterday’s 6.7% drop took Nvidia’s share price down to $118, having briefly hit an alltime high of $140 last week. Buff Dormeier, chief technical analyst at Kingsview Partners, sees short-term support around the $115 level, with the next significant level at $100. These support levels are calculated by using Fibonacci retracement levels, using stock price data to work out where a stock might have support on the way down, or face resistance on the way up. Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, points out that Nvidia’s longer-term trend remains strong – the stock is still trading well above its 50-day moving average around $101 and 100-day moving average at $92. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Nvidia, one of the hottest shares on the market this year, has dropped into a correction – leaving traders worrying that the air is coming out of the AI stock boom. After three days of chunky falls, Nvidia’s stock has now dropped by 13% since – briefly – becoming the world’s largest company a week ago. Yesterday it tumbled by 6.7% on Wall Street, taking its losses over the last few days to over $500bn(!). That’s the biggest three-day value loss for any company in history, Bloomberg reports. Nvidia’s falls pulled the wider market down too, as Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank explained this morning: Nvidia has been driving markets again over the last 24 hours, as its share price came down another -6.68%, building on its -4.03% decline over the previous week and -16.1% from the intra-day high on Thursday. In turn, that held down US equity returns more broadly, as the losses for Nvidia pushed the NASDAQ (-1.09%) and the S&amp;P 500 (-0.31%) into negative territory for the day. Nvidia’s share price falls follow a stellar run – the stock is still up almost 140% in 2024, and has almost tripled over the last 12 months. The rally had been driven by excitement about artificial intelligence systems, which are powered by Nvidia’s high-end chips. But some analysts had been concerned that the AI boom had run too high, and was turning into a bubble. David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, says there are signs of profit taking by investors who bought shares in “Market darling Nvidia” on the way up: Some profit-taking seems entirely reasonable given NVIDIA’s meteoric rise. The stock was up over 180% this year alone. But if it continues to lose ground, then there’s a danger of contagion, with selling spreading to other big tech names. If that were the case, then the market could be in for a deeper and more protracted pull-back. Yet there are few indications that investors are even thinking along these lines. Nvidia has been posting very impressive financial results this year. In the last quarter, revenues surged by 262% year-on-year, with earnings per share up a staggering 629%. But the enthusiasm for Nvidia’s stock this year had pushed its valuation to levels that implied it would keep beating expectations with stellar revenue and earnings. Another factor weighing on Nvidia is that CEO Jensen Huang has been selling stock this month, through a trading plan. That has focused attention on whether the stock was somewhat overvaued. Another point: we’ve approaching the end of the financial quarter – so some investors will be rebalancing portfolios and cashing in profits. Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at capital.com, explains: It’s difficult to extrapolate what can be attributed to technical factors and what’s fundamentals in the markets, with price action apparently driven by end-of-month and end-of-quarter positioning. A sell-down in tech, despite little shift in rates expectations and the outlook for earnings, may signal a trimming by investors of the quarter’s big winners. Nvidia epitomises the dynamic, down 12% in three days and little-to-news.

        "title": "UK winemaker Chapel Down considers raising cash or sale as trade sparkles",
        "content": "Britain’s biggest wine producer, Chapel Down, is considering raising cash and even putting itself up for sale to fund more vineyards and build a new winery in a booming industry transformed by rising temperatures and tax breaks. Chapel Down in Kent is Britain’s best-known producer, founded in 2002 and is expected to make 3.4m bottles of sparkling and still wines from last year’s harvest. It is looking for more funds for its growth strategy, which includes investing in new vineyards, a new winery to be up and running for the 2026 harvest, and the development of its wine estate at Tenterden. It said: “As part of the review, the board will consider all alternatives, including investment from existing shareholders, investment from new shareholders, a sale of the company, and other relevant transactions.” After posting revenue of £18m last year, the company said it was on track for double-digit sales growth this year. Its shares have risen by 14.5% since their debut on London’s junior Aim market last year, moving from the Aquis Exchange, and fell 1.2% on Tuesday, giving Chapel Down a market value of £111m. Britain’s wine industry is still small and concentrated in southern England, but rising temperatures created better growing conditions for grapes, resulting in a boom in new vineyards. Vines are being planted as far north as Yorkshire and Scotland, and their UK number has almost tripled from two decades ago to 943. However, in traditional wine-growing regions such as Italy, Spain, France and southern California, extreme heat is expected to decimate harvests. British wine is also growing in popularity: almost a third of Britons said they would celebrate a wedding with English fizz in a recent Aldi survey, while 15% would serve up champagne at a divorce celebration. Britain is the fastest-growing wine region in the world, according to the property group Knight Frank. Between 2017 and 2022, England and Wales more than doubled wine production from 5.3m to 12.2m bottles, according to WineGB. It expects wine production to double again to 24.7m bottles by 2032. The UK has also caught the eye of Pommery and Taittinger, two of France’s best-known champagne houses, which both bought land and planted vines in England about a decade ago, while the world’s biggest sparkling wine producer, Germany’s Henkell Freixenet, snapped up the English wine estate Bolney in 2022. Last year was a record harvest and will be remembered as a “near perfect year” for vineyards, WineGB said. There was little spring frost, good flowering weather in June, and after a wet July and August some very warm spells in September and October. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Chapel Down has made a name for itself over the years but the business appears to have a hit the ceiling in terms of scale. To grow even more, it really needs a big slug of cash to invest in the business and that might be better coming from a new, bigger owner, rather than going cap in hand to shareholders on an ad hoc basis. “Plenty of big drinks companies would be in the market for a niche player like Chapel Down as it could add something new for them to get their teeth into, and also as a way of cross-selling products.”",

        "title": "‘Songwriters deserve a bigger piece of the pie’: the music publishing boss on the threat of AI",
        "content": "Arriving in London in the teeth of the pandemic to take a top music industry job, Shani Gonzales had few opportunities to immerse herself in British culture, with venues shut and parties off the table. The New Yorker instead turned to TV for her education, bingeing on The Crown, Downton Abbey and – a more left-field choice – Naked Attraction. “I was trying to get as much of a cross-section as possible!” says Gonzales, who heads the UK arm of music publishing giant Warner Chappell. “Music is culture, taste, environment – it felt daunting not being able to leave the house and meet artists in a role like this.” Nearly four years on, she has hit her stride and believes her appointment provides a signal for songwriters. “[The UK] is a very important music market, both historically and continues to be cool … But also I’m American, so clearly we’re showing you that we walk the walk – you come and sign here and it isn’t just a UK approach.” She says expanding songwriters’ reach globally has boosted Warner Chappell’s revenues. The publisher traces its roots to 1811 and has been in its current form since the 1980s, its history connecting the compositions of Ludwig van Beethoven to modern artists such as Lizzo and Madonna. Its roster includes David Bowie, Dua Lipa and Shaboozey. While music labels are occupied with the business of record releases and artists’ tours, publishers act as “labels” for songwriters, helping land them licensing deals, collecting royalties, connecting them with recording artists and getting songs played on adverts, film and TV. Their charges may be big name singer-songwriters in their own right, lower-profile artists, or, increasingly, dedicated behind-the scenes songwriters, who also attract fame. Warner Chappell has just over 12% of the music publishing market, lagging rivals Sony and Universal, which have about double that share each. But the company is on the front foot. Last year it broke $1bn in revenues for the first time. In the UK, profits rose sharply to almost £26m on turnover of £137m, which is up 29% on 2022, according to its last publicly available accounts. “This business cannot and does not stop in the US, so we’ve made some changes, paid more attention around the world, and been more global, not just local,” Gonzales says in her London office off Kensington High Street, where gold and platinum discs from artists such as Rihanna and Central Cee are stacked up. She praises Len Blavatnik, Britain’s second richest person, according to the Sunday Times rich list, who is a majority owner of Warner Music through his Access Industries vehicle, saying he is “tuned in and paying attention”. (She’s met him “a couple of times” but “we don’t braid each other’s hair and toast marshmallows on the weekends”, she jokes.) But despite the rising revenues, the industry faces a significant headache in the form of generative AI – from machine-spawned songs deliberately designed to land on popular playlists to video mock-ups of artists singing covers. “I want to make sure my songwriters and artists continue to be treated fairly and compensated financially. There’s so many versions of AI – the people who are providing the lyric and the melody that generative AI is learning from need to be remunerated,” says Gonzales. “You can play around in the studio and you can make, like, Drake sing a Bruce Springsteen tune. Right now, people are just having fun and throwing it up online, but what happens when someone says: ‘I’m going to sell that’? I wouldn’t go to a restaurant, take the food and not expect to [pay].” Gonzales believes governments need to step in to tackle the issue and prevent a repeat of the piracy that ravaged the CD industry. “It took years to recover from that,” she says, admitting she happily used the file-sharing software Napster as a “dumb college kid”. The roots of her career were set before college, however. Her mother and father had migrated from Jamaica and Trinidad respectively, with Gonzales born while they were studying at Cornell University. She grew up in Queens, New York City, and recalls her bemused dad watching on as she “blustered about the house crying” over the death of rapper Biggie Smalls. Shunning expectations that she would go to law school, she pursued a career in the music industry, although her initial intention was to eschew the unstable hedonism of being an artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) representative, the industry’s talent scouts. However, she eventually relented and rose through the ranks, developing artists including DJ Khaled, Justin Bieber and a young Travis Scott. She moved through some of the industry’s biggest companies – BMI, Epic Records, Def Jam and BMG – and led international A&amp;R for Warner Chappell before her current role. Today, one issue is a constant for her: artist remuneration. Returns to artists have been described as “pitiful”. The singer Raye, who dominated at this year’s Brit awards and with whom Gonzales has worked closely, has claimed “songwriters are being manipulated” in the industry and called on other artists to push the cause for better pay for them. “I agree with her, and I respect that she is using her platform and fame to talk about it,” says Gonzales. “Songwriters do deserve a bigger piece of the pie, and that’s what we’re here to do.” Is it embarrassing to present streaming royalties of fractions of a penny to her talent? “I don’t know if I find it embarrassing – it’s a moment to teach them how, or if, you want to prioritise commerciality versus creativity. It’s a balance. Sometimes it’s fractions of a penny and you say ‘something’s got to change’ – at other times, it seems about right.” Another boss who has pushed for better returns for songwriters is Merck Mercuriadis, whose company Hipgnosis hit turmoil over the valuation of the music rights it owns. Industry sources had long griped over Hipgnosis’s tactics, claiming it had overpaid and driven up the price of big artists’ back catalogues. “They definitely got to a level of ambition that I did not always appreciate … I was curious about how they value things and if it could sustain itself long term,” Gonzales says. But with Sony reportedly landing Queen’s back catalogue for a record-breaking $1bn last week, the volume is still turned up on music dealmaking.

        "title": "‘Skinny jabs’: weight-loss drugs set for new boom as generic versions emerge",
        "content": "Medicines that enable dramatic weight loss are likely to experience a new boom in uptake, experts have said, as the first generic versions hit the market this week at a lower cost than the original drugs. The injections, dubbed “skinny jabs” by the media, can help people lose more than 10% of their body weight and have become hugely popular in recent years, with celebrities lauding their effects. They include Wegovy and Saxenda, which are licensed for weight loss, and Ozempic and Victoza which are licensed for type 2 diabetes but are often prescribed “off-label” as a weight-loss aid. All four mimic a gut hormone called GLP-1 and are produced by the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk. It announced on Tuesday that it was to invest more than $4bn (£3.2bn) in US plants manufacturing the injectable drugs to try to meet booming demand. While such treatments are available to some patients on the NHS, private access is expensive, and recent shortages have made them hard to get hold of. But change is afoot. Patents for Victoza and Saxenda have expired, according to Novo Nordisk. As a result, other drugmakers are working on generic versions. Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries the world’s largest generic drugmaker, launched a generic version of Victoza in the US on Monday. The move comes days after the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, tentatively approved London-based Hikma Pharmaceuticals’ generic version of Victoza. They are not alone: among others reported to be planning to launch their own generic liraglutide products (the active ingredient in Victoza and Saxenda) are Pfizer, Viatris’s Mylan and Novartis’s Sandoz. Such drugs are cheaper than the originals. According to Teva, the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of its new generic will be 13.6% lower in price than Victoza at $469.60 for the two-pack and $704.40 for the three-pack. “WAC pricing does not account for the price discounts offered to customers and is not reflective of our final net price,” a company spokesperson said. But this is only the beginning, with Ozempic and Wegovy both losing patent protection in China in 2026, in Europe and Japan in 2031, and in the US in 2032. Prof Giles Yeo of the University of Cambridge said generic versions will lead to a further boom in use – particularly in lower-income countries. “Rich people will always want the shinier new drugs,” he said, adding that newer medications will probably have fewer side-effects. Mark Samuels, the chief executive of the British Generic Manufacturers Association (BGMA), described the first wave of generic weight-loss medicines as a “potentially transformative opportunity for public health”. “The current market is largely private via patients who are self-paying,” he said. “The cost of the patented medicine is often prohibitive for the NHS, so it has been sparingly prescribed by clinicians. However, the onset of generic competition will likely significantly reduce the price, and this means the NHS can afford to treat more patients. This has a broader population health benefit as greater access to these medicines will reduce the crippling strain obesity-related conditions have on NHS resources.” In the UK, generic competition typically reduces prices paid by the NHS by as much as 80% to 90% after loss of exclusivity, according to the BGMA. Dr Simon Cork of Anglia Ruskin University said competition in the form of new medications will also play a big role in any future pricing arrangements of those that now exist. Eli Lilly’s diabetes drug Mounjaro has just been approved for obesity in the UK and it is developing another weight-loss drug, Retatrutide. “Competition will, I suspect, reduce the cost of these medications, particularly since the drugs coming on to the market often display more favourable weight loss than semaglutide,” he said. Victoza brought in £245m of sales for Novo Nordisk in the first three months of this year, down by 23% from a year earlier, while Saxenda’s first-quarter sales halved to £188m. Last year, Victoza made £982m of sales, down by 30% on 2022, while Saxenda posted revenues of £1.2bn, down 4%. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry has defended the use of patents as being vital to health breakthroughs. Claire Machin, the industry body’s executive director of international policy and UK competitiveness, said developing drugs was a high-risk process, with the average cost of taking a medicine from discovery to launch put at $2.3bn last year. “For every 10,000 compounds that are tested, only one or two will successfully pass all stages of research and development and clinical trials to become licensed medicines available to patients,” she said. “A strong intellectual property framework enables the development of cutting-edge medicines and sustains future innovation.” While generic forms of Victoza are appearing this month, Yeo said the big turning point will be when semaglutide – the active ingredient of Ozempic and Wegovy – can be made as a generic. “A powerful drug will then be available to the vast majority of the world, which would be amazing,” he said. Cork said any reduction in cost was to be welcomed, not least because at present GLP-1 analogues can only be prescribed for use for two years on the NHS for eligible patients. “This was introduced in no small part because of the questionable cost effectiveness of their continued use,” he said. “A reduction in the cost would shift the balance of this cost effectiveness, potentially paving the way for their longer-term use – especially when coupled with research showing the reversal of weight loss after patient stop taking them, and the continued benefit in cardiovascular risk associated with longer term use.” Dr Ivan Koychev of the University of Oxford, who is researching the application of GLP-1 analogues in dementia patients, said demand for such drugs was currently outstripping supply as a result of the high prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. “This is evidenced by members of the public sourcing these medications online or attempting to reconstitute the drugs themselves,” he said. While it is unclear how widespread the practice is, internet forums including Reddit have numerous examples of people reporting that they have been injecting themselves with such “DIY” preparations. However, experts have warned the approach is dangerous, with some people taking unlicensed versions of semaglutide ending up needing emergency hospital care after buying from unregulated online sellers without a prescription. Yeo said the availability of cheaper generic versions of drugs such as semaglutide could help to tackle the problem. “Becoming a generic will make its supply far safer, because that would undercut the hidden market in the product,” Yeo said. “We’ll also have far more information about its long-term safety profile, which can only be a good thing.”",

        "title": "Vauxhall owner says plants could shut unless UK helps EV makers",
        "content": "The owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands has warned its car plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton could close unless market demand for electric vehicles picks up and the UK loosens regulations. The UK managing director of Stellantis said the company did not want to shut operations in the UK but it would make a decision in “less than a year” in the face of unreasonable government sales quotas and the lack of consumer incentives in relation to VAT on vehicles and electricity. “You have to make strategies that are based on efficiency. I want to keep the production [in the] UK and I want to be clear on this,” Maria Grazia Davino said. It is “stupid” for government not to work with industry to protect jobs, she said. She added that the demand for EVs was “soft” and unless there were further incentives for businesses to buy the electric commercial vehicles or more support from the government the firm may have no choice. “The demand is not coming. We expect the government whoever it is to respond to this. We work together in the country for the benefit of the health of economy and the people,” she said. “Whoever gets to the government they have to listen … In the UK there will be consequences for sure on the production. Stellantis UK does not stop. Stellantis production in the UK could stop.” The warning comes weeks after the chief executive of Stellantis criticised the government’s EV policy as “terrible”, saying it could ultimately lead to car manufacturing facing bankruptcy. Carlos Tavares blamed the UK’s quota system, which forces manufacturers to meet sales targets that he said were “double” the market demand. The so-called zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate forces manufacturers to sell an increasing proportion of electric cars. The ZEV mandate applies to all car sales, whether made in the UK or imported, so it is unclear why it would force a manufacturer to shut down British plants that export significant volumes. However, Stellantis wants the electric vans it makes in those factories to count as cars for the purposes of the ZEV mandate. That would make it much easier to hit the targets. Des Quinn, national officer for staff union Unite, said he would support a new government easing the ZEV mandate for those car companies that invested in the UK to protect jobs. “There’s got to be a balance,” he said. “I would give a bit to take something back in terms of automotive sector and industrial strategy.” It is the second time in a year that Stellantis has questioned the viability of factories at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, where it produces electric vans and cars after a £100m investment, and Luton, where it produces larger petrol and diesel vans, with electric versions to come next year. Earlier this year, the UK and European industry averted “cliff-edge” tariffs on imports and exports of EVs across the Channel because of a clause in the Brexit trade deal that was suspended for three years after pressure was put on EU leaders. The renewed closure threat will put pressure on Labour, which polls suggest will win the general election next week, to give carmakers more leeway. Davino said they had yet to have any talks with the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, or Labour leader, Keir Starmer. “We care about the employees. They are the reason why we work actually so hard. I work to keep my staff here and this is why I am advocating personally so much,” Davino told reporters at a conference organised by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a lobby group, in London. She said the government’s EV policy was affecting its business model, forcing it to “invest more” than the market demands, amid plateauing electric sales, making the justification for remaining in the UK less viable than plants elsewhere around the world. If the customer did not see an “advantage” in buying an EV they would continue buying conventional petrol or diesel vehicles, she said. Ashley Andrew, the president of Hyundai Motor UK, called on the government to “half the VAT” on EVs for consumers, which is now at 20%. He also called for VAT parity on electricity, with tax on home energy rated at 5% while those who charge on the public road are hit with 20% VAT on their bill. Stellantis started electric-only production at Ellesmere Port in 2023, producing a range of electric passenger vehicles including the Vauxhall Combo Life Electric, Peugeot e-Rifter and Citroën ë-Berlingo multi-purpose vehicles. The government has been approached for comment.",

        "content": "Shares in Airbus tumbled on Tuesday after the aircraft maker cut its profit forecast and blamed persistent part shortages, which have affected production of its A320neo jets. In an unscheduled update late on Monday, Europe’s biggest aerospace group trimmed its delivery forecast, and pushed back the schedule for the production ramp-up of A320neo planes. Airbus also took a €900m (£761m) charge for its troubled space activities. Airbus shares fell almost 10% on Tuesday. The company now expects underlying operating income of €5.5bn this year, below its previous forecast of between €6.5bn and €7bn. This is because it estimates that it will deliver 770 aircraft this year, down from its earlier forecast of 800, albeit higher than last year’s 735 jets. It also moved its production target of making 75 A320neo aircraft a month from 2026 to 2027. At the moment, it is making about 50 jets a month. Airbus said it faced “persistent” and “specific” supply-chain problems, mainly affecting engines, cabin equipment and aerostructures (components of the airframe such as wings and fuselage). The Airbus chief executive, Guillaume Faury, said: “We are facing headwinds right now; we have to bite the bullet.” He said supplies of engines for its bestselling A320 family of narrow-body jets had worsened “significantly” in recent months. Faury said engine makers would have to “face the consequences” of any delays, which could imply penalties. He said Rolls-Royce-made engines for the A330neo were behind schedule, but not those for the A350. Shortages of seats and cabin parts were another “very difficult situation,” Faury said. The aerospace industry has been struggling to rehire workers and stabilise supplies after the Covid-19 pandemic left many suppliers with weak balance sheets. As the world’s biggest aircraft producer, Airbus has borne the brunt of the problem while its main US rival Boeing faces regulatory curbs and an internal crisis, but some experts and suppliers, including engine makers, have long expressed doubts about its plans, saying they were too ambitious. Faury said an uncertain outlook for the industrial commitments of aerostructures maker Spirit Aerosystems had contributed to the new, lower targets. He declined to comment on a widely expected deal in which Airbus would acquire Spirit assets related to the A350 and A220 jet programmes, as part of a carve-up of the supplier with Boeing, which is expected in the coming days or weeks. Boeing is inching closer to a deal to buy back Spirit after its former subsidiary made substantial progress in separate talks with Airbus over a transatlantic breakup of the struggling supplier, Reuters reported last week.",

The facility, which will have roof-top solar panels, will double the space of Novo Nordisk’s three existing facilities in North Carolina, and add 1,000 jobs, on top of the nearly 2,500 people already working for the drugmaker in the state. The company’s president and chief executive, Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, said: “It took us a century to reach 40 million patients, but through this expansion and continued investment in our global production, we’re building Novo Nordisk’s ability to serve millions more people living with serious chronic diseases in the future. “This is yet another real signal of our efforts to scale up our production to meet the growing global need for our life-changing medicines and the patients of tomorrow.” Overall, Novo Nordisk plans to invest $6.8bn in production this year compared with $3.9bn last year, to increase supply of its injectable drugs. Wegovy and Ozempic have become hugely popular amid an obesity crisis in many countries, which led to shortages and the company rationing the use of them. The medicines have been endorsed by celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, although others such as the US comedian Amy Schumer have said they stopped taking Ozempic because of the side-effects. The success of its drugs has led to an 84% increase in Novo Nordisk shares in the past year, making it Europe’s most valuable company and its market value more than the entire Danish economy. Henrik Wulff, the firm’s executive vice-president for product supply, quality and IT, said: “Clayton was the first manufacturing site for Novo Nordisk in the US, and this new large-scale investment confirms the continued importance of our production facilities there as cornerstones of our company’s growth.” Wegovy and Ozempic are part of a new class of weight-loss and diabetes drugs known as GLP-1, which mimic the action of a gut hormone and suppress people’s appetite. They have helped some people lose significant amounts of weight but can cause unpleasant side-effects such as nausea. Novo Nordisk and its main competitor, the US drugmaker Eli Lilly, raised their sales forecasts last month. Eli Lilly’s diabetes treatment tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro, was approved for obesity at the beginning of this month, giving patients and doctors what the medical regulator said was a more effective alternative to semaglutide, better known as Wegovy.",

        "title": "EDF, Utilita and British Gas rated worst energy suppliers for customer service",
        "content": "EDF, Utilita and British Gas have been named as the worst energy suppliers for customer service, as research shows industry standards have slipped sharply. Citizens Advice said customer service ratings across the industry were among the lowest ever between January and March and average ratings had fallen by 10.5% compared with the same period in 2021. The charity also said it had been contacted for help with energy issues by record numbers of people last month and called for the industry regulator, Ofgem, to be handed stronger powers to tackle poor customer service. The research showed EDF Energy had received the lowest star rating out of 16 household suppliers last quarter, at 2.06 out of five. The findings represent a reversal for the supplier, which is owned by the French state; its average call waiting times have increased from just under a minute to more than five minutes in less than a year. Utilita was rated second worst, although its 2.08 rating was an improvement from the previous quarter, while British Gas, the UK’s biggest energy supplier, received a rating of 2.39. Ecotricity, a green energy supplier, was rated highest at 3.77, beating Outfox the Market and Ovo Energy. The ratings are calculated using data on complaints, call times and response times to customers by email and on social media. Citizens Advice said there had been an improvement in average call waiting times after guidance was introduced by Ofgem in December. The regulator now requires suppliers to contact customers if they miss two monthly or one quarterly payment to check if they are struggling with their bills and consider repayment options. However, companies performed badly on their ability to resolve customer complaints, which brought overall ratings down, the charity said. Energy suppliers have been in the spotlight since wholesale gas prices began to escalate in 2021, forcing suppliers out of business and pushing up household bills. Customer service has not returned to pre-crisis levels, which caused more people to seek support from suppliers over debts and an increase in the force-fitting of prepayment meters. The practice was temporarily banned in 2023 amid concerns that vulnerable consumers were being cut off from heat and power. Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “When millions are struggling to afford the essentials, it’s completely unacceptable that energy companies are failing to give their customers proper support. Citizens Advice has long called for Ofgem to be given stronger powers to hold suppliers to account on customer service. That must include tackling the complaints backlog before next winter.” The increase is household costs has eased since the height of the energy crisis, but they remain far higher than before it began. Next week Ofgem’s quarterly price cap will fall by £122 to the equivalent of £1,568 a year. “News that bills are dropping slightly from July will be cold comfort for the record numbers seeking help from our advisers. The next government must introduce better targeted energy bill support for those struggling to keep the lights on or cook a hot meal,” said Moriarty. An EDF spokesperson said: “We recognise our call answer times haven’t been up to the high standards we set ourselves and are committed to doing better, getting back to the market-leading service our customers expect.” A spokesperson for Utilita said: “We must not underestimate how savvy consumers are today. They will realise the star rating contradicts other market-wide supplier assessments – including those of Ofgem, Trustpilot and Which? – where Utilita performs consistently well.” British Gas declined to comment.",

        "title": "Britvic should play hardball: no Fruit Shoots on the cheap for Carlsberg | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "The omission in Carlsberg’s £3bn-plus takeover tilt for Britvic, the UK soft drinks firm behind Robinsons barley water, J2O, Tango and R White’s lemonade, has been resolved. The Danes, pursuing their “beyond beer” strategy, did not forget that PepsiCo could kill the whole adventure by yanking the UK bottling rights for Pepsi, 7Up and Lipton’s Ice Tea from Britvic under a “change of control” clause. The US fizzy drinks titan had agreed to waive the clause if the deal happened, Carlsberg said on Monday. Since nobody in their right mind would buy Britvic without those rights, this takeover tale would now seem to come down to the simple matter of price. Britvic has already rejected offers at £12 and £12.50 a share, it told the market on Friday. At what level would its board be obliged to surrender in usual boring fashion and declare that fair value has been reached? Well, one hopes the Britvic directors have stiffened their resolve with something stronger than a Fruit Shoot. If they truly believe their bullish talk in last month’s half-year numbers about “market-leading growth”, “multiple new growth spaces” and “our long-standing track record of delivering outstanding returns for our shareholders”, they should be up for a scrap. The point about Britvic is that, for the first time in ages, it can look forward to vaguely normal trading conditions. After a sugar tax, a pandemic –which clobbered high-margin sales to pubs and restaurants – and then a burst of inflation in raw materials for packaging and so on, life looks OK. The soft drinks market offers few examples of explosive growth (Fever-Tree was an exception) but Britvic’s wider portfolio can be expected to deliver sales growth of 5%-ish, double-digit margins and enough cash for modest share buy-backs, which have been £75m in recent years. By way of add-on excitement, it has a smaller operation in Brazil that is growing at a decent clip. Before the pandemic, the shares were around the £10 mark and the return to close to that level, before Carlsberg showed up, was justified by the numbers. City analysts expect profits to top £200m this year and earnings per share to improve at a steady rate of 10%-ish for the next couple. The board’s rejection of £12.50 as a “significant undervaluation” was justified. Perhaps surprisingly given its size and the fame of its core brand, Carlsberg looks to be the party with the strategic conundrum. Its beer business in the UK, a joint venture with Marston’s, is No 4 in the market. It would prefer the UK, rather than China, to be its biggest market. And it wants to be less reliant on beer at a time when per-capita consumption of alcohol is falling in western Europe. So Britvic, offering easy savings in distribution costs in the UK, makes for an understandable purchase. But those factors also mean the target should be prepared to play hard to get. Investec’s analyst, Matthew Webb, thinks £13.50, or a 39% premium to the share price before the fun started, “would be enough to get the deal done”. But, actually, there’s a fair argument that Britvic’s board should hold out for more: think £14 to surrender independence. Remember, you only get to sell the company once and the UK market can be terrible at valuing FTSE 250 companies fairly. Only fizzy terms should do.",

        "title": "Two-thirds of green energy projects in Great Britain fail to clear planning stage",
        "content": "Two-thirds of applications to build renewable energy projects in Great Britain have failed to get through the planning stage over the past five years, hampering efforts to shift towards clean electricity generation. A study of Britain’s “renewables pipeline” found that 63% of mooted projects were either abandoned, refused planning permission, or an application was withdrawn or ultimately expired between 2018 and 2023. The remainder of the applications were either approved or revised, according to the research by the consultancy Cornwall Insight. Renewable energy developers have bemoaned the difficulty in gaining planning permission for projects – from offshore windfarms to onshore solar and battery storage developments – and waiting times to connect to Britain’s electricity grid of more than a decade. The research found no region of Great Britain had a success rate higher than 20% of projects gaining planning permission. Cornwall Insight said “speculative and duplicate applications” were in part to blame, citing reports that “phantom” energy projects were holding back efforts to decarbonise the grid. Last year, a report commissioned by Centrica, the owner of British Gas, claimed that some developers were applying to connect projects to the grid that did not even have land rights or planning consent applications. National Grid and Ofgem, the industry regulator, have attempted to remove “zombie projects” – those that have been approved but have stopped being developed – from the connections queue. The problem has also been blamed for years-long delays to new housing schemes. Lucy Dolton, the assets and infrastructure manager at Cornwall Insight, said: “It’s clear that an increasing number of the applications submitted are speculative, raising the numbers in the connections queue, and creating obstacles for projects that are mostly ready to connect.” The amount of electricity generated by the UK’s gas and coal power plants fell by 20% last year to its lowest level since 1957. Renewable energy provided the single largest source of power at 42%, although gas power plants still accounted for 31%. The Conservatives have set a goal to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035, while Labour is targeting 2030. Both parties have pledged to slim down the planning regime if they win next month’s general election. The Conservatives have promised to speed up the average time it takes to sign off a big infrastructure project from four years to one year. Labour has said it will update planning policies and fund extra planning officers. The party has made energy policy a central pillar of its election campaign. It has pledged to set up a state-owned company, Great British Energy, and set targets to double onshore wind, quadruple offshore wind and triple solar power by 2030 in an effort to ultimately hit the UK’s legally binding commitment to reach net zero by 2050. However, the party was also accused of making the “mother of all U-turns” in February, dropping a plan to invest £28bn a year in green energy. Dolton added: “The total capacity of projects in the grid connection queue is currently well in excess of what is necessary for net zero generation capacity. However, considering the lengthy process for projects to progress through planning and gain grid connections, and the current volume of projects that are unsuccessful, the amount of this capacity that will ultimately connect could be much lower than the pipeline of projects suggests.” Campaigners have argued that allowing renewable developments on a relatively small proportion of extra land could make a significant difference. Research by Friends of the Earth and the University of Exeter this year found that England could produce 13 times more renewable energy than it did now, while using less than 3% of its land.",

        "title": "Brussels accuses Apple of breaking EU rules; Badenoch and Reynolds clash over business – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up…. Business secretary Kemi Badenoch has told UK business leaders they should not risk handing the economy to Labour. Her opposite number, Jonathan Reynolds, has argued that businesses can’t risk another five years of a chaotic and unstable Conservative government. Reynolds and Badenoch also clashed over the UK’s net zero plans, plans for apprenticeships, and were also quizzed about their leadership ambitions. Here are today’s main stories: The Bloomberg debate wrapped up with quick statements from the two protagonists. Jonathan Reynolds goes first, saying businesses are facing too many serious challenges to risk another five years of a chaotic and unstable government. “It’s time to return to a government that solves problems, rather than causing then”, he says, pledging to keep working with businesses after the election. Kemi Badenoch says the difference between the two parties is that Labour want to bring in new laws that make it harder to hire staff, and to micro manage businesses. Conservatives believe in capitalism, she pledges, the power of business to do good. “We don’t think profit is a dirty word, and we are optimistic about our future,” Badenoch concludes. And finally… Q: Bloomberg turns to its guests’ leadership ambitions. Jonathan Reynolds gets the giggles, turning red, before insisting he is “very much focused” on becoming the secretary state for business and trade. Keir Starmer has done a “quite exceptional” job of turning Labour around, he adds. Kemi Badenoch (who has been cited as a potential leader if the Conservatives are hammered in next month’s election) says the question was obviously meant for her (getting Reynolds guffawing). Badenoch says she stood for the leadership before, and lost, and is now “terrified” at the prospect of Labour coming into power. She insisted there was “no better job” than Business and Trade Secretary, which “is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister”. Q: Some cabinet ministers may lose their seats… would you be up for the leadership challenge if it came up? Badenoch says leadership issues will be discussed after the election, not before…. That doesn’t exactly rule out a Badenoch bid… and appears to leave the door open for one…. Q: Should Thames Water be nationalised? Kemi Badenoch says Thames Water is a “very, very difficult” situation; she doesn’t want to move markets by discussing nationalisation while it is going through difficulties. Reminder: The Guardian reported in April that the government was considering radical plans to renationalise Thames Water, under which most of its £15.6bn debt would be added to the public purse. The palava with Thames Water shows that the UK’s regulatory system is not working well, as the company tries to make a profit, keep bills low, and invest in infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds says people are unhappy about the state of the UK water industry. Reynolds hopes that nationalisation can be avoided, pointing out that investment must involve losing as well as gaining money. Onto topical issues. Q: Have you met with Shein, and would you put any restrictions if they chose to list in the UK [a decision which is moving closer…]. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour have met with Shein. Many people who are considering economic activity in the UK have spoken to Labour in recent years, he explains. His view is that if companies are doing businesses in the UK, they should be regulated from the UK. So, a listing would be the way to enforce the “highest standards” on, for example, the labour market, regulatory compliance, or tax. Any listed company in the UK has a fairly significant set of compliance placed upon them. If you are keen to see businesses operating to the highest standards, you should want to see them do that from the UK. Kemi Badenoch, the current business and trade secretary, reveals she has NOT met with Shein. She has two concerns with a potential Shein listing in London. 1) The way Shein ships individually packaged orders directly from Chinese warehouses to consumers’ homes, meaning they fall below the £135 threshold for import duty “That could mean quite a lot lost in terms of taxes,” Badenoch says. 2) Concerns that Shein are using forced labor in Xinjiang. Q: What’s your policy on money from the Middle East and China? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour is extremely keen to bring in overseas investment. The Gulf is an “obvious place to look for that” money, he says, while China brings different considerations in terms of national security. Labour will hold an investment summit in its first 100 days of power, he says, and ‘make the case’ for investing in Britain. Reynolds says many of Labour’s plans come from the “reasonable complaints” of businesses who said they considered investing in the UK, but were put off by the prime minister changing, or because they didn’t know the country’s plans post-2016 (the year of the Brexit vote). Kemi Badenoch says the UK already has the largest foreign domestic investment of an European country. Q: What will you do to help small businesses get paid on time? Kemi Badenoch says it is “extraordinary” how larger corporations treat smaller firms in their supply chain. “We will look again” at more regulations to speed up payments, she pledges. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour would force the audit committees of large public companies to say how quickly they pay their suppliers – that would address the power inbalance that allows them to leave small firms waiting for money…. Kemi Badenoch is then asked about why more trade deals haven’t been signed. Badenoch says the US government is not signing any free trade deals at the moment, so the UK has been signing agreements with individual US states instead. It has been “very difficult” negotiating with India, she adds; any deal with Delhi has to work for business. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour will improve the UK’s relationship with the European Union – starting with it not being governed by the internal politics of the Conservative Party. He says Labour will seek to reduce checks on food and agricultural products, and to improve the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Reynolds argues that ‘relitigating the arguments on the customs unions or the single markets would not provide the stability Britain needs. Q: The EU say they’re open to negotiating a deal to ease border friction for fresh food, for example, but it must have a role for the European Court of Justice. Will you accept that? Reynolds says Labour won’t give away its negotiating hand. But surely, if you don’t want lower food standards than the EU, you can remove some of the trade frictions and costs. Kemi Badenoch says the Conservative government tried to strike such a deal, but the EU wouldn’t accept it. She insists the UK can’t accept oversight by the ECJ. Onto Brexit! Q: What is your top proposal to cut costs for businesses exporting to the EU? Kemi Badenoch claims that it’s hard to tell the impact of Brexit, versus the impact of the pandemic. But she insists that services exports have been “going gangbusters”, making the UK the 2nd largest services exporter, and the 4th largest exporter in the world. “Those are facts”. Well….. this thread from Sky News’s Ed Conway shows that the picture is not quite as rosy as that: Next issue – fiscal issues, and the IMF’s warning that both major parties’ manifestos are too opaque and lack detail on tax and spend. Q: They say voters will be voting in a knowledge vacuum…. Kemi Badenoch says she “completely disagrees” with IFS’s assessment. The truth is that people are not placing their votes based on the IFS’s analysis, but actually base it on what a party believes in, and what its values are. She says the mini-budget showed the problems of cutting tax without cutting spending. We are the party of sound money, of business, Badenoch promises. Jonathan Reynolds says he respects the IFS…. and agrees that the Conservatives record speaks for itself (!). Taxes are at a record high, and public services don’t reflect that tax burden. The key is to break out of this low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop, Reynolds says – and that’s Labour’s plan. He says the UK would have billions of pounds more, if the economy had grown at the rate of the last Labour government. Q: Are you ready to fight interest groups which won’t like the planning changes you have in mind? Reynolds says that’s why Labour needs a mandate, so it can build the homes and infrastructure Britain needs. Kemi Badenoch disputes this claim, pointing out that Labour members of the House of Lords had blocked the government’s attempts to remove nutrient neutrality rules, and free up housebuilding. Next, a question on Labour’s plans for more protection against unfair dismissal, and ending zero-hours contracts. Q: Is a Labour government going to make life much harder for small businesses? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour’s manifesto is “a pro-worker, pro-business” agenda, that – he says – has been developed closely with businesses. That includes a better business environment, changes to planning rules, certainty on tax, that will deliver more growth. Reynolds adds that “The floor will rise”, but insists the vast majority of businesses are already operating at a much higher level than this new, higher floor already. Kemi Badenoch hits back, saying it’s businesses don’t want these measures. She claims it’s “unbelievable” that Reynolds claims these new regulations have been developed with businesses. She insists: Businesss is terrified of what Labour is selling. Badenoch says Labour’s plans for employment rights from day one are unpopular, and that the CEOs of Asda, Currys [see here] and M&amp;S have said these are “terrible regulations”. Reynolds returns fire, saying that the Conservative Party promised an employment bill after Brexit, and security in the workplace, and hasn’t delivered on it. Labour, he says, will create a better working environment, one where people have secure work they can build a family round. Badenoch won’t accept this, telling business leaders they should be “absolutely terrified” of “surrendering” your business, the economy, and tax, to Labour. Badenoch argues that Labour are “fishing in an empty barrel”, and that flexible working rights are not the cause of problems in the UK economy. Jonathan Reynolds agrees that governments must change their plans when circumstances change… …and blames Liz Truss’s “disastrous mini-budget” for forcing Labour to drop its £28bn green investment plans. He then returns to his criticism of Rishi Sunak’s climate u-turn speech last September, in which the PM pushed back the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers. That was a “short-lived relaunch of the Rishi Sunak premiership”, Reynolds says, to pitch the PM as a change candidate. Kemi Badenoch then explains that governments respond to changing circumstances and instability – citing elections in Europe, and across the Atlantic. In an apparent criticism of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, Badenoch declares: Look at what is happening in the US – we don’t even want to talk about the candidates that they’ve got for election, so many difficulties. This uncertainty is all over the world, and we have managed to keep our economy growing. [er, there was a shallow recession last year….] The point about net zero, Badenoch adds, is that it can be an opportunity, but other things need to be delivered too, on a “no regrets” basis. The CBI get the next question: Q: Is the transition to Net Zero a growth opportunity to be seized, or a cost to be mitigated? Labour’s Jonathan Reynolds insists it’s one of the greatest opportunities that have ever existed for the UK. The transition could address regional inequality, and some of the long-standing problems in the UK economy, he says. Government’s job is to build and shape the markets that the private sector will work in, he insists. He criticises the government for chopping and changing its own policies, and claims that Rishi Sunak’s climate u-turn speech last autumn was ‘dishonest’, as it talked about the costs today rather than the markets that are being built around the cost of transition. Investors need certainty, he says, and they don’t have it at the moment. Badenoch, though, says net zero is both an opportunity and a cost. She says there was cross-party agreement on net zero, before Covid and the War in Ukraine has changed the landscape. That’s why the PM made his announcement last year, she says, because circumstances changed. And she takes a swipe at Reynolds’ criticism of Sunak’s u-turn last year, saying: To say that is dishonest, is to just show a lack of understanding of the reality of governing. Jonathan Reynolds says he’d be “extremely worried” if Conservatives politicians were to pick which degrees had value. It would be another Culture War issue, he warns. Reynolds adds that the UK should be proud of its higher education sector – he wouldn’t want fewer young people in his constituency at Greater Manchester to go to university. Kemi Badenoch hits back on that last point – insisting the Conservatives do value higher education. But, if businesses tell us that the skills coming out of higher education are not the skills we need, we need to ‘re-orientate what we’re doing’, Badenoch explains. Q: so it about certain degrees that are not worth doing, or is it about what you could do instead? Badenoch says it’s both, saying the Conservatives want to reduce the courses where students end up earning less than if they’d not gone to university at all. So over to Jonathan Reynolds! He confirms that Labour’s flagship policy is to reform the apprenticeship levy, so that businesses can use some funds to other forms of training. He points out that the number of apprenticeships has declined, so giving businesses some flexibility makes sense. [Explainer: Under current rules, larger firms must give 0.5 per cent of their total payroll to HMRC, which can be claimed back to spend on apprenticeships. But the funds can only be spent on apprenticeship training and assessment with a training provider; the Treasury reclaims unspent levy money]. Reynolds adds that Labour want further education colleges specialise, and become technical excellence colleges. Reynolds also says he often worries about “the denegration of higher education by this Conservative government. We should be a country that can recognise the contributions that both sectors bring. Onto questions, first on skills. Q: The lack of skilled workers is the top issues hurting British businesses, according to the Institute of Directors. How will you fix it? Kemi Badenoch says we are in an era where the skills needed to grow the economy is changing, and that the government has invested £3.6bn in this. She says the government wants to make sure people can take apprenticeships to learn practical skills, rather than the “university degrees that some are taking that don’t necessarily deliver what we need for economic growth”. She says she’s worried by Labour’s plans, saying its apprenticeships reforms are unfunded…. Kemi Badenoch speaks next, saying business has a clear choice at the next election. She tells the audience at Bloomberg: The Conservatives, who are the party of entrepreneurs and wealth creators, or Labour, the party of trade unions and a big regulatory state. Badenoch says business owners need to think who is better for them, and their business. She points out that the last decade has been “the toughest” for businesses globally – starting with the aftermath of the global financial crisis, which was followed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Badenoch says: We’ve been challenged by a war in Europe that has raised energy costs at the same time that we decided to deliver net zero, which I know is a cost to business, while delivering an exit from the European Union, which the people voted for. Badenoch says it has been a time of “extreme global turbulence”, but inflation has been brought down, and the UK is forecast to grow faster than France, Italy, Germany and Japan over the next four years. She adds: Now is not the time for more uncertainty by handing the economy to Labour. You can watch the debate between Kemi Badenoch and Jonathan Reynolds here: Bloomberg are hosting a debate now between business secretary Kemi Badenoch and her Labour opposite number, Jonathan Reynolds. Reynolds speaks first, declaring that there’s no reasonable argument for the Conservative’s to remain in office. He says: The last 14 years have been marked by political chaos, by economic stagnation and – too frequently – by improper behaviour. Business and investors need stability, and that only comes with a change to a Labour government, Reynolds pledges. Reynolds adds that Labour have an agenda to get Britain moving: planning reform, an industrial strategy, ambitions on green energy, and a “pragmatic, good-faith” relationship with the EU. He adds reforming the apprentive levy, business rates, and an agenda for small businesses, to that list of plans. Reynolds says Labour is hugely appreciative of the support it has received from businesses, adding: Together we can turn the page on the last few years, look to the future, and start to rebuild Britain. Chinese online fashion company Shein has moved a little closer to floating on the London stock market. Reuters is reporting that Shein confidentially filed papers with Britain’s markets regulator in early June for a potential London listing, according to two sources. A Shein float would be one of the largest IPOs globally this year, as the company’s value has been estimated at £52bn. Shein had initially hoped to float on the US markets, but has now pivoted to London having faces many hurdles across the Atlantic as relations between Washington and Beijing have worsened. Taiwan’s manufacturers are having a bumper year, helped by strong demand for semiconductors from the AI sector. Taiwan’s industrial production growth rose to above 16.1%, year-on-year, in May, beating forecasts. This is the fastest growth since highest level since July 2021, which was affected by base effects from the pandemic. ING economist Lynn Song says: The strength of Taiwan’s industrial production has been concentrated in several sectors. Computers, electronics, and optical products (31.8% YoY) once again led the way in May for the second consecutive month, while electronic parts and components (29.3% YoY) also continued to outperform, driven by the semiconductor (41.0% YoY) subindex. Given semiconductors account for over a third of Taiwan’s total industrial production weight, the strong demand for semiconductors amid the AI boom has been a core pillar of the recent recovery of industrial activity. UK manufacturers are hoping for a “modest” rise in output over the next quarter. The latest industrial trends survey from the CBI has found that output volumes were broadly unchanged in the three months to June, leaving factory bosses expecting a slight pickup over the next three months. The long-running poll also found that total order books improved in June compared with May, but were still below normal. Less encouragingly, export order books were also seen as below normal and deteriorated relative to May. London Tunnels, a company that plans to turn Second World War tunnels in the UK capital into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the City. Instead, London Tunnels has decided to raise money by floating on the Amsterdam stock exchange. London Tunnels plans to restore the Kingsway Exchange Tunnels in Central London, originally built in the early 1940s, and designed to shelter people during the London Blitz. Back in January, it announced it intended to float on the London Stock Exchange, saying it was right that the tunnels – which it has agreed to buy – should be listed in London. But it has now dropped those plans in favour of an IPO on Amsterdam’s Euronext, in a blow to the capital’s public markets. London Tunnels hopes to raise £30m, and be valued at £130m. The float prospectus, though, warns that its plans could be delayed if it can’t get the full planning permission it needs to turn the tunnels into a tourist attraction that can accommodate three million visitors per year. Other risks include the possibility that it doesn’t manage to acquire the leasehold of the Tunnels, or that the “structural integrity of the Tunnels” may be affected by their age or other factors. Apple has been found to be in breach of sweeping new EU laws designed to allow smaller companies to compete and allow consumers to find cheaper and alternative apps in the tech business’s app store. The European Commission, which also acts as the EU antitrust and technology regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple following an investigation launched in March. In preliminary findings, against which Apple can appeal, the European Commission said it believed its rules of engagement did not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) “as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternatives channels for offers and content”. In addition, the commission has opened a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns its new contract terms for third-party app developers also fall short of the DMA’s requirements. More here: Back in the UK, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is warning that the UK’s public finances face a “toxic mix”, with debt at a 60-year high, taxes near an all-time high, and public services visibly struggling. In its analysis of the political parties manifestos, the IFS says spending on many public services will likely need to be cut over the next five years if government debt is not to ratchet ever upwards or unless taxes are increased further. The IFS say this is due to high debt interest costs, a growing welfare budget, and rising spending on health and defence. It accuses the two main parties of largely ignoring these raw facts. IFS director Paul Johnson explains: We need more efficient and effective public services. We need a government laser-focused on improving our economic performance. It’s good to see those facts acknowledged. But on the big issues over which governments have direct control - on how they will change tax, welfare, public spending - the manifestos of the main parties provide thin gruel indeed. On 4 July we will be voting in a knowledge vacuum. If - as is likely - growth forecasts are not revised up this autumn, we do not know whether the new government would stick roughly to the day-to-day and investment spending totals set out in the March Budget, or whether they would borrow more or tax more to top them up. If they were to stick to spending plans we do not know what would be cut. If taxes are to go up, we do not know which ones. We certainly don’t know how they would respond if things were to get worse. The choices in front of us are hard. High taxes, high debt, struggling public services, make them so. Pressures from health, defence, welfare, ageing will not make them easier. That is not a reason to hide the choices or to duck them. Quite the reverse. Yet hidden and ducked they have been. You can watch the IFS’s briefing here. Today’s Ifo business confidence survey shows that the German recovery is still stuttering, says Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. Brzeski explains: Germany’s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, dropped to 88.6 in June, from 89.3 in May. After three consecutive increases at the start of the year, business confidence has weakened again, illustrating that the cyclical bottoming out will not automatically be followed by a strong recovery. Today’s Ifo index weakening was exclusively driven by declining expectations, while the current assessment component remained unchanged, albeit at a low level. A strong rebound for this year remains highly unlikely, Brzeski fears, citing the Euros as an example: To some extent, since the start of the year, the German economy has gone through similar phases as the German national football team at the European Championships so far: too much enthusiasm about a good start to the tournament only because the years before had been miserable: a painful reality check in the first 89 minutes in the match last night against Switzerland, followed by a blast of euphoria after scoring in the very last minute. Euphoria after a draw, not after a win; it’s a new reality, both in German football and for its economy. Elsewhere in Europe, gloom is rising at German companies. German business morale has fallen this month, according to the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, whose business climate index has fallen to 88.6 points this month, down from 89.3 points in May. IFO reports that business expectations have weakened, at a time when Germany’s economy is struggling to overcome stagnation. The report found that factories are being hit by a fall in orders, an issue which is also hurting building firms. Clemens Fuest, president of the ifo Institute, explains: In manufacturing, the business climate declined after three rises in a row. Companies were again more skeptical for the months ahead. They were particularly concerned by the declining order backlog, but were somewhat more satisfied with current business. In the service sector, the index rose. Service providers assessed their situation more positively. The outlook for the second half-year also continued to brighten. Sentiment in the hotel sector, in particular, improved, while the hospitality sector expressed dissatisfaction. In trade, the business climate deteriorated considerably. Regarding expectations, skeptical sentiment increased markedly. Assessments of current business have been corrected downward. Both wholesalers and retailers were equally impacted by the negative development. In construction, the index rose slightly. This was thanks to less pessimistic expectations. However the current situation was assessed as worse. A lack of orders remains a core problem. Elsewhere, another day, another accusation by European regulators that Apple is breaking its tech rules, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, adding: This time the EU Commission said that Apple is breaching its rules because it does not allow customers of its App store to be steered to alternatives. Apple seems to be on a merry-go-round of EU regulatory scrutiny. It’s share price is up slightly in pre-market trading, however, the intense regulatory focus on Apple in recent years is one of the reasons why the stock is lagging the performance of other tech titans, and why it is the second weakest performer in the Magnificent 7 so far this year. Filomena Chirico, who leads the implementation of the Digital Markets Act, has posted that no company should feel it is above the law because they are “big and powerful, shiny and cool”. ‘Big’, ‘powerful’ and ‘shiny’ are fair enough, but ‘cool’? Brussels journalist Catherine Feore has doubts: Today is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the Digital Markets Act, declares Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy at the EC. Vestager says: Our preliminary position is that Apple does not fully allow steering. Steering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers’ app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers. We have also opened proceedings against Apple in relation to its so-called core technology fee and various rules for allowing third party app stores and sideloading. The developers’ community and consumers are eager to offer alternatives to the App Store. We will investigate to ensure Apple does not undermine these efforts. The European Commission’s latest concerns about Apple fall into two camps. The EC has informed Apple that it has taken a preliminary view that App Store rules breach the Digital Markets Act (DMA), as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content. The EC has opened a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns that its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app stores, including Apple’s new “Core Technology Fee”, do not comply with the DMA. On the first point, the EC says that Apple is making it hard for developers to tell customers about alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases. It says that none of Apple’s business terms allow developers to freely steer their customers, and that the fees charged by Apple when a developers acquires a new customer through the AppStore go beyond what is strictly necessary. On the second point, the EC will investigate whether Apple’s new contractual terms for developers comply with the DMA. It cites three concerns: Apple’s Core Technology Fee, under which developers of third-party app stores and third-party apps must pay a €0.50 fee per installed app. The Commission will investigate whether Apple has demonstrated that the fee structure that it has imposed, as part of the new business terms, and in particular the Core Technology Fee, effectively complies with the DMA. Apple’s multi-step user journey to download and install alternative app stores or apps on iPhones. The Commission will investigate whether the steps that a user has to undertake to successfully complete the download and installation of alternative app stores or apps, as well as the various information screens displayed by Apple to the user, comply with the DMA. The eligibility requirements for developers related to the ability to offer alternative app stores or directly distribute apps from the web on iPhones. The Commission will investigate whether these requirements, such as the ‘membership of good standing’ in the Apple Developer Program, that app developers have to meet in order to be able to benefit from alternative distribution provided for in the DMA comply with the DMA. You can read more here. Apple has said it had “made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission”. It added (via the FT): “We are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99 per cent of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created.” Newsflash: Brussels has accused Apple of restricting competition on its app store. European commissioner Thierry Breton has announced that the EU will take action against Apple under its new digital regulations, the Digital Markets Act. Posting on X, Breton says: For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies — denying consumers new opportunities &amp; choices. Today we are taking further steps to ensure AppStore &amp; iOS comply with the DMA. The EU are also investigating whether Apple’s developer fees breached the bloc’s rules, the Financial Times reports, adding: As part of the new probe into developer fees, Brussels said it was looking at whether Apple was imposing too many restrictions for users to download and install alternative app stores. Speaking of misery….the monthly mortgage of a first-time buyer has soared by more than 60% to exceed £1,000 a month since the last general election. That’s according to figures from Rightmove that underline the financial challenge facing Britons trying to gain a foothold on the housing ladder. Over the last five years, the average mortgage payment for a typical first-time buyer in Great Britain has risen by 61% to £1,075 a month, up from £667 in 2019, according to the property website Rightmove. The increase of about £400 a month is linked to the march of house prices and interest rates, which have heaped financial pressure on borrowers, whose average wages have grown by just 27% over the same period. The financial squeeze has forced many younger borrowers to either look for smaller properties or to take out an ultra-long mortgage. More here: Shares in Britvic have jumped 7% in early trading, after suiter Carlsberg removed one hurdle to a potential takeover. Carlsberg has told the City that drinks giant PepsiCo has agreed to waive the change of control clause in the bottling arrangements it has with Britvic. This waiver will come into effect if an acquisition of Britvic by Carlsberg proceeds to completion. Last Friday, Robinsons maker Britvic announced it has rejected two takeover approaches from Carlsberg, but a further bid is still possible. Currently, Britvic has a bottling agreement with PepsiCo giving it exclusive distribution and sales rights for all of the US company’s brands, including 7Up and Lipton Iced Tea, until 2040. But it includes a change-of-control clause that would allow PepsiCo to end the deal, making Britvic less attractive as a takeover target, The Sunday Times reported. Carlsberg says today that it is “considering its position”, adding “There can be no certainty that any offer will be made”. Britvic shares are up 7.3% at £11.74, having hit an alltime high this morning. Ouch indeed! Shares in SIG have tumbled 22% at the start of trading in London to a four-year low, after the building supplies firm’s profit warning this morning. A slowdown in demand across parts of Europe has hit UK building supplies firm SIG. SIG has warned shareholders this morning that profits will be well below expectations for this financial year, saying that market conditions have remained challenging. The company has blamed a slowdown in the French and German markets. Demand has also been weak in “the end markets of our UK Interiors business”, SIG adds, a sign that Britons may be cutting back on home improvement amid the cost of living squeeze. It adds: Whilst we continue to see more robust demand in our Poland, Ireland and UK Exteriors businesses, Group sales overall were weaker than expected in May and June to date. SIG now expects full year underlying operating profits of £20m-£30m, which is below the current analyst range of £36.7m to £43.0m. It hopes that sales will pick up in the second half of this yeara, but cautions: The extent of this improvement is subject to the evolution of demand conditions, particularly given market uncertainties in France and Germany, and recognising the sensitivity of operating profit to relatively small movements in sales. Mike Ashley has pulled off another retail deal. Ashley’s Frasers Group has struck a deal to buy a portfolio of luxury goods websites form UK e-commerce firm THG The two companies have also agreed a partnership across several areas including with THG Ingenuity, the online platform that serves third-party brands, and online sports nutrition brand Myprotein. Advertised salaries for UK jobs have fallen slightly for the first time since last autumn, according to new research which suggest the jobs market is weakening. Jobs site Adzuna reports this morning that the average salary being offered for advertised vacancies fell by 0.1% in May, on a monthly basis, to £38,765, down for the first time since last October. Adzuna says: While slightly weaker salaries could help relieve some of the tightness in the UK labour market, it may also suggest increasing vacancies for entry or junior-level roles with lower salaries. On an annual basis, salaries were 2.69% higher than in May 2023, following the rise in the National Living Wage to £11.44/hour at the start of April. The report also found that. vacancies were increasing for teachers but falling for nurses and healthcare staff. Andrew Hunter, co-founder of Adzuna, says: “Hopes that a return to growth in Q1 would result in greater confidence in hiring were not reflected in job vacancies in May, which remained essentially flat. However, there were slight increases in roles in Travel, Teaching and Manufacturing - areas where there have been some entrenched staff shortages. “The UK job market has been met with resistance in the past few months but the upcoming general election may have the potential to salvage the situation. Any outcome is likely to move the needle on the sluggish job market, with both the Conservative and Labour parties pledging to create more jobs. Sectors highlighted in their manifestos, such as Healthcare &amp; Nursing, Energy, Oil &amp; Gas, and Manufacturing, all experienced a vacancy drop of more than 20% year-on-year as of May 2024.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain’s Misery Index is tipped to rise later this year and through 2025, giving the next government an early headache. Unemployment is set to increase further, puncturing the boost from inflation having fallen back to normal levels this year. That means the Misery Index — dreamed up in the 1970s to capture the combined impact of unemployment and inflation on the population — is likely to worsen over the next 18 months. The UK unemployment rate has already risen to its highest level in two and a half years, at 4.4% in the February-April quarter. It is forecast to keep rising; the Bank of England estimates it will average 4.6% in the second quarter of 2025, and rise further to 4.8% in Q2 2026 and 2027. Bloomberg has calculated that this will push up the Misery Index to around 7.5 points over the first 18 months of the next government, up from six points at present. The Misery Index has been falling under Rishi Sunak’s premiership, having hit a painful 15 (the worst since the 1990s) under Liz Truss’s administration in autumn 2022, when inflation was a 40-year high. Andrew Oswald, a professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Warwick, told Bloomberg: “We still have quite strong underlying wage inflation, unemployment will have to rise to reestablish the equilibrium. “That will be much more painful than inflation has been.” Both major parties are promising to help working people, if they win next month’s election. Labour’s pledges include delivering a genuine living wage, updating trade union legislation, banning exploitative zero hour contracts and ending fire and rehire tactics. The Conservatives are promising another cut to national insurance rates, maintaining the National Living Wage at two-thirds of median earnings, and creating 100,000 more apprenticeships in England every year by the end of next Parliament. But without a pick-up in growth, economists fear unemployment will rise as firms lay off some of the staff they have been hoarding in recent years. As Hetal Mehta, head of economic research at St. James’s Place, put it: “Ten to fifteen years ago, if you said to people unemployment is going to be 5%, they would’ve said that’s a great outcome, but now we’re talking about unemployment rising from what was a much lower point. It will be a difficult message for any new government to manage.” More here: UK’s Next PM Faces Rise in Economic Misery Right After Election The agenda 9am BST: IFO German business climate index 10am BST: IFS to publish analysis of the General Election manifestos 11am BST: CBI industrial trends survey of UK manufacturing",

        "title": "London Tunnels moves IPO plan to Amsterdam in blow to UK markets",
        "content": "London Tunnels, which aims to convert an abandoned underground network into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the capital, instead opting to list in Amsterdam. The company aims to make the Kingsway exchange tunnels, a network of 8,000 sq metres under Holborn in central London, into a new attraction that will bring in 2 million visitors a year. The group revealed on Monday that it hoped to raise £30m by listing on Euronext Amsterdam, saying it could make the most of the size and scale of the equity and capital markets of Europe by listing in the Dutch capital. The decision comes after the company sent papers to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in January outlining its intention to float in the capital. At the time, its chief executive, Angus Murray, said: “This unique set of tunnels, owned by a British company, built by the British government, for the defence of Britain, that can further enhance London’s reputation as a leading tourist destination, should be listed in London.” The change of heart by the company is the latest blow to the LSE after a number of high-profile companies opted to list in Europe and the US ahead of London in recent months. In May, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, announced its decision to switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London. However, this has been partly offset by big players such as the fashion retail company Shein and Raspberry Pi announcing plans to list on the LSE. The Kingsway tunnels were built in the early 1940s to shelter up to 8,000 people during the blitz but were never used for this purpose. Instead, the Special Operations Executive, responsible for organising espionage and sabotage operations in German-occupied Europe, moved in during the final two years of the war and is thought to be the inspiration for the Q branch in Ian Fleming’s James Bond novels. The tunnels later housed the first secure transatlantic telephone cable, which ran a hotline that connected the White House and the Kremlin during the cold war, before ownership was transferred to British Telecom (BT) in 1981. London Tunnels has agreed to buy the site from BT next year and intends to open the attraction in 2027, including exhibits celebrating the history of the tunnels, as well as reinstating the city’s deepest London bar, which closed in the 1980s. However, the float prospectus lists a number of risk factors to the project, including the warning that plans could be delayed if it cannot get the full planning permission it needs. Last month, it secured the planning green light from the City of London Corporation but is still awaiting planning signoff from the London borough of Camden. The list also includes risks around whether the structural integrity of the tunnels is affected by their age, the possibility that the removal of asbestos from the tunnels may take longer than expected, and that the company may be unable to complete the acquisition of the leasehold on the agreed date of 30 June next year. Explaining its decision for moving the listing, London Tunnels said it could meet the £20m to £30m needed over the first few years of development. It added that it would then look to raise a further £120m in debt and equity to make the tunnels operational.",

        "content": "Boeing is reportedly facing the prospect of criminal charges after US prosecutors reportedly told the Department of Justice (DoJ) that the US manufacturer had violated a settlement related to two fatal crashes of the 737 Max plane. The DoJ’s leaders have until 7 July to decide whether it intends to file criminal charges against Boeing after prosecutors on the case recommended them, according to Reuters and CBS News. The DoJ last month told a federal court in Texas that Boeing had violated the terms of a 2021 settlement in which it agreed to pay $2.5bn (£2bn) in penalties and compensation to airline customers and families of those who died in two fatal crashes. Boeing failed to “design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics programme to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations”, according to the court filing. New criminal charges would be the latest round of recriminations from the two crashes. A total of 346 passengers died in the crashes of Boeing 737 Maxes operated by Indonesia’s Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines in late 2018 and early 2019. The crashes prompted the greatest crisis in the company’s history, forcing the worldwide grounding of Boeing’s bestselling aircraft for nearly two years. The crashes were caused by a new design that – unbeknown to pilots – dipped the nose of the planes automatically to compensate for shifting larger engines forwards. The system, known as manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system (MCAS), left the planes vulnerable if a single sensor failed. The deferred prosecution agreement protected the company from a fraud charge related to its alleged concealment of information from aviation regulators over how the system worked. At the time of the settlement, the DoJ said: “Boeing’s employees chose the path of profit over candour.” The agreement was meant to end in January, which would have removed one element of uncertainty for the company. It faces renewed scrutiny of its safety record after an incident two days before the settlement expired when a door panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines plane in mid-air. Reuters reported that the final decision to go ahead with new charges had not been made. One source said Boeing could face new charges going beyond the original 2021 fraud conspiracy charge. Under the terms of the settlement, the DoJ also has the option of extending it by a year or proposing new, stricter terms. The New York Times previously reported that Boeing could avoid criminal prosecution. New charges would also cast a shadow over the last months in post of the chief executive, Dave Calhoun, who will retire later this year after a term dominated by the aftermath of the crashes. In testimony to the US Senate last week, Calhoun acknowledged that “something went wrong” at the company after whistleblowers allegedly faced retaliation for raising concerns about safety problems in factories. Boeing declined to comment. The DoJ declined to comment when contacted by Reuters and CBS News.",

        "content": "Mike Ashley’s Frasers has bought luxury goods websites from THG in a deal that will also include selling the online health and beauty retailer’s protein powder in Sports Direct shops. THG on Monday said it had sold sites including Coggles to Frasers as part of a partnership deal that also includes Frasers using THG’s technology in some parts of its business. The deal is Mike Ashley’s latest acquisition in an effort over several years to shift his retail group’s focus away from Sports Direct towards more premium brands, including the House of Fraser department store and the luxury clothing retailer Flannels. Sports Direct still accounts for half the company’s sales. For THG, the deal will bring in a new customer for its retail website technology, as well as providing an outlet for its products, including its Myprotein brand, in Sports Direct stores. Frasers will use THG for management of couriers and running its Australian delivery operations. THG has struggled to live up to its billing as a tech company when its shares floated on the London Stock Exchange. Its shares initially jumped to a valuation of £5.6bn when they were first listed in September 2020. However, since then the company’s market value has fallen to about £800m. The company is led by Matthew Moulding, whose 15% holding briefly made him a billionaire on paper. His shares were worth £123m at the end of last week, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. When Moulding started the company it initially sold CDs tax-free online, but shifted to running websites for other retailers. However, its direct-to-consumer retail operations are still a crucial part of its revenues. THG its the luxury division had sales of about £43m in the 2023 financial year and nearly made a profit “despite a broader challenging luxury market”. The Coggles brand, started in 1974 as Sarah Coggle, sells men’s and women’s clothing, shoes and home products. Frasers has a long history of snapping up struggling sports and clothing retail brands. Purchases in recent years have included the clothing brand Jack Wills, the suit maker Gieves &amp; Hawkes, Evans Cycles, the video game store Game and the fast-fashion brands Missguided and I Saw it First. In March, Frasers put another luxury retail brand, Matchesfashion, into administration three months after buying it. Frasers said it was unwilling to fund a turnaround.",

        "title": "John Lewis clothing range aims to ‘minimise waste and maximise longevity’",
        "content": "Fabric that shrinks or bobbles is a pet peeve of Britons who want to buy long-lasting clothes, with the low quality of high street fashion contributing to the 30,000 shipping containers of clothing and homewares dumped by consumers every year. With retailers tasked with finding ways to reduce the environmental impact of the clothing they sell, the first wave of products in a new range especially designed to “minimise waste and maximise longevity” has gone on sale at John Lewis. The 20-strong “circular” collection is “just the beginning” of an overhaul that by 2028 will reach thousands of products, the department store chain says. Described as products that will “stand the test of time”, the initial range includes pyjamas, babywear, knitwear, mattresses, duvets and pillows. Textiles and fashion are responsible for up to 10% of global carbon emissions, and despite growing awareness, the UK consumes more clothes per head than any other country in Europe. Almost half (45%) of UK citizens buy clothing at least once a month, while one in four (23%) still regularly buy clothing with the intention of using it for a short amount of time. The result of this is that, on average, each person in the UK throws 35 items of unwanted textiles straight into general waste every year, according to anti-waste charity Wrap’s 2024 textiles market situation report. It estimates that 711,000 tonnes of textiles are put into black bins or general waste skips at recycling centres, a volume that equates to almost 30,000 shipping containers full of cast-off fashion and home textiles items a year. At the same time, Wrap warns that the textiles that do get donated responsibly have plummeted in price due to the saturation of the market with low-quality fast fashion, resulting in less income for the reuse and recycling sectors. More thoughtful design can help manage the fallout from this consumption, with up to 80% of a piece of clothing’s impact determined at the design phase, says Wrap. It is championing circular design, which involves using recycled or sustainable materials and creating durability by, for example, using stronger stitching for seams. In keeping with this philosophy, products in the John Lewis range have an increased amount of recycled content. The jumper, albeit with a hefty £135 price tag, is made with Sustainable Fibre Alliance (SFA) certified cashmere. The £8.50 sleepsuit is, it says, made to be passed on, after being tested to higher durability standards. Kathleen Mitchell, the store’s commercial director, said it was looking at ways to “combine style and sustainability” for its customers. “We know they want products that look good and that last, and that’s exactly what these designs offer,” she said. Circular design also factors in how clothing can be more easily recycled when the owner has finished with it. This means restricting the number of fabrics used. In the pyjamas, for example, an elastic waistband has been replaced with a simple fabric tie.",

        "content": "Chinese-owned British Steel has reportedly submitted a request for a package of taxpayer support worth £600m as it looks for assistance from the next government to upgrade to less polluting technology. Government officials are due to review plans that set out the costs of switching from blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces at the company’s steelworks in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, the Sunday Times reported. The steel industry is one of the UK industries that could be most affected by a change of government at the general election. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who is heavily favoured in polls to be the next prime minister, has stuck to a pledge to invest £3bn in decarbonising the steel industry despite rowing back on other environmental spending plans. Ministers will have the final say over any support for British Steel after the election. Any deal is likely to receive close scrutiny because of the Chinese ownership. China produces more than half of global steel, and has previously been accused of dumping steel in other countries to win market share. Ministers in the new government would also have final say on whether an already agreed £500m subsidy for Indian-owned Tata Steel would go ahead. Rishi Sunak’s government agreed the deal with Tata to switch production at Port Talbot in south Wales from two blast furnaces to a single electric arc furnace. If Labour wins power, it is understood the UK’s ability to make steel from iron ore, known as primary steelmaking, would be an important consideration when deciding support for individual companies, although it is also keen for private sector companies to invest alongside. The shadow business minister, Jonathan Reynolds, has described primary steelmaking as a “sovereign capability” because of its role in building nuclear submarines and wind turbines. British Steel has struggled financially since being rescued from collapse in March 2020 by China’s Jingye. Auditors for the company in January warned the business, which employs 4,500 workers, faced “material uncertainty” over its future. British Steel in November announced plans to close its two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe and replace them with much cleaner electric arc furnaces at Scunthorpe and Redcar, in North Yorkshire. The plans could eventually mean 2,000 job losses, because electric arc furnaces require far fewer workers. Tata is also planning to make as many as 2,800 workers redundant in the switch to electric technology. It has claimed that any attempt by Labour to renegotiate the terms of the deal could put steelmaking in Port Talbot at risk. Alasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary of Community, a steelworkers’ union, said Labour’s £3bn investment could be a “gamechanger” for the industry. “We need the next government to recognise the vital importance of the steel industry to our economy and national security, and to show ambition for the future of the sector,” he said. “That’s something which has been dismally lacking over recent years, as epitomised by the bargain basement plan Rishi Sunak signed off with Tata – a proposal which would remove Britain’s primary steelmaking capacity and leave the country reliant on dirty steel imports from overseas.” Neither the plans from Tata Steel nor British Steel would, as they stand, preserve the UK’s ability to produce steel from iron ore, as now happens in Britain’s remaining blast furnaces. The companies plan to feed scrap steel into electric arc furnaces to melt the metal down. One option for producing near-zero-emissions steel is making direct reduced iron (DRI). The DRI process removes oxygen from iron ore using gas. If green hydrogen is used no carbon is released into the atmosphere, and the iron can be used in an electric arc furnace. However, neither Tata nor British Steel are thought likely to consider investing in a DRI plant without major government support. The companies have previously argued that their loss-making operations make it difficult to invest without this. A DRI plant could cost as much as £1bn to build, according to some industry estimates. British Steel declined to comment.",

        "content": "The outgoing chair of John Lewis has insisted that the retail group is “back on track” and “more fit for the future” with an improving financial position enabling it to spend money refurbishing Waitrose supermarkets and opening convenience stores. Sharon White, who will retire as chair of the John Lewis Partnership in September, said the upmarket Waitrose brand was “underrepresented in convenience” as it sought new avenues of growth. John Lewis, which owns Waitrose and the eponymous department store chain, has endured several challenging years, as the upheaval of the pandemic was followed by the cost of living crisis. At the start of this year, the Guardian reported that it was considering cutting as many as 11,000 jobs over the next five years. In March the group reported a return to profit, banking pre-tax profits of £56m in the year to 27 January, compared with a £234m loss the previous year. However. the staff-owned retailer, which employs about 74,000 staff, who it calls “partners”, did not pay its staff an annual bonus for the third time in four years. At that time, White said it was “entering a year of significant investment” and planning to spend £542m – up 70% on a year before – adding that it was “on track” to hit its target of making £400m in profit by 2028. The group’s financial difficulties meant Waitrose had not been able to invest as much in its stores as its rivals, White said. But progress made righting the ship meant it had now had the cash to do so. “We’ve started to think about how we get the right balance between service and productivity,” she said, outlining a plan to refurbish 80 stores over the next three years. Acknowledging that a growing number of shoppers were expressing dismay over the proliferation of self-service checkouts, she promised: “You won’t see Waitrose stores completely stripped of partners and relying on self-checkout.” “The big thing is, we’ve now got the cash to invest in the future of the business,” she told the Telegraph. “Across the two brands last year we generated something like £210m more, which means we’ve got the cash to invest into growth this year.” With a small chain of Little Waitrose convenience stores under its belt, the retailer has had to strike deals with the likes of UberEats and Deliveroo to meet the growth in demand for small, quick shops. White, who will be replaced by the former UK boss of Tesco, Jason Tarry, said that taking a bigger slice of the convenience market was a “top” priority. “I think having a bigger presence for Waitrose locally and with more local ranges is a massive opportunity for us,” she said.",

        "content": "Thank you for your report (Hybrid working makes employees happier, healthier and more productive, study shows, 16 June), which helps to widen the debate on the impacts of post-Covid working from home (WFH) to include those difficult-to-measure areas, not just of productivity but also other aspects of work, such as happiness, health and wellbeing. However, one problem is that it is not so simple, as it depends on what is meant by such an elastic concept as WFH. Rather than a simple either/or binary divide of WFH versus working in the office, we need to calibrate work on a spectrum, allowing more blended, mixed or hybrid forms. WFH could be contingent on thinking about answers to three key questions about the work. First, depth – what sort and type of work is being done eg routine, administrative, procedural versus knowledge, conceptual, intellectual? Second, scale – what breadth does this working encompass ie how individual-versus-team-based is it? Both of these are impacted on by the third dimension, temporal – how long is such working for ie hours per day, days per week, weeks per year? Such nuance can help shed light on and take some of the heat out of the debates, as well as help leaders/managers and their employees reach agreements and move forwards more amicably.

        "title": "Supermarkets could face billions in fines for grocery code breaches as Labor commits to reforms",
        "content": "Labor has promised to legislate massive new fines for breaches of the grocery code of conduct, which would be made mandatory under changes proposed by Craig Emerson’s independent review. On Monday the Albanese government will announce it is adopting in full the recommendations of Emerson’s report on the code, an interim version of which was released in April amid consumer and supplier complaints about soaring supermarket profits. The central recommendation is to impose maximum penalties for the more harmful breaches of the code of up to $10m, three times the benefit gained from the contravening conduct, or 10% of turnover in the preceding 12 months. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Given Coles’ and Woolworths’ annual turnovers of more than $40bn each, that recommendation could result in the competition watchdog seeking penalties in the billions. In the final report, to be released on Monday, Emerson said larger penalties should apply to breaches of: “obligations on supermarkets to deal with suppliers lawfully and in good faith; have and retain written grocery supply agreements; train staff; and keep records” and those that did not “address retribution” against suppliers. The final report adds a call for penalties of just over $1m “for breaches of other substantive provisions in the code”. Penalties for less serious breaches would be up to $187,800. “Suppliers’ fear of retribution has been a major obstacle to the pursuit of their rights under the code,” Emerson said. The report said suppliers feared that complaints or reasonably rejecting requests from a supermarket could result in “being offered less-advantageous trading terms, reduced volumes in orders, poorer shelf location, limits on distribution across stores and having products delisted altogether”. Emerson recommended that the code be made mandatory for all supermarkets with an annual Australian revenue of greater than $5bn. This would apply to Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and Metcash – which owns IGA – which are all signatories to the voluntary code but is also likely to capture Costco in time and could capture Amazon if it expanded its grocery offering. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and assistant competition minister, Andrew Leigh, promised to create an anonymous supplier and whistleblower complaints mechanism within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. In a statement the pair promised to “prioritise” legislation to enact the reforms. But bipartisan support is in doubt, as the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has labelled Emerson’s work “a Mickey Mouse review that has been conducted by Labor” and questioned whether it will result in a reduction in prices. The Coalition is considering laws to break up supermarket chains if they breach the code, as urged by the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, although some Liberals have warned against the plan or suggested it should be limited. Emerson, the former competition and trade minister, has called such a penalty as “too heavy handed” and not a credible threat. Chalmers and Leigh said the review “is an important part of the Albanese government’s broad competition reform agenda, which includes an ACCC inquiry into supermarket prices, funding for Choice to conduct quarterly price monitoring reports … and progressing legislation to implement the biggest change to our merger reform system in almost 50 years”.",

        "title": "Volvo does a sharp U-turn as the boxy estates and saloons return to Britain",
        "content": "It is not the kind of risky manoeuvre any self-respecting Volvo estate driver would execute, but the Swedish carmaker has performed a sharp U-turn on the decision to stop selling them here after an outcry from drivers devoted to a car synonymous with British middle-class family life. Last summer Volvo dropped the bombshell that it would no longer market its estates or saloon cars in the UK and would instead concentrate on its sports utility vehicles (SUVs), which are increasingly favoured by drivers who like the higher seating position and off-road styling. “The appetite for our saloon and estate models has fallen to very low levels in the UK, which has led to our decision to remove these models,” it said at the time. However, in recent days the company confirmed a change of heart as the V60 and V90 models are set to return to UK showrooms and will start taking orders in July. Before they were withdrawn from sale, both models started at about £41,000. The traditional estate car – usually a boxy five-seater with room for luggage (or dogs) in the boot – has fallen out of favour in many parts of the world, and in 2023 SUVs accounted for nearly half of global car sales. This shift has been bad news for the environment – the rise of the bulky, heavy SUV accounted for a quarter of global growth in oil demand last year, pushing up global emissions. A Volvo spokesperson said: “While this [shift to SUVs] remains a long-term trend, we have seen a resurgence for our estate products in recent months and have decided to reintroduce the V60 and V90 to our UK portfolio in response to this. We will begin taking orders next month.” Estate cars – known as station wagons in the US – met the practical need to ferry large amounts of luggage, the name evoking trips to and from the railway station for the landed classes. Volvo made its first estate car in 1953, the Duett model, which could be used for carrying a family as well as commercial loads. In the decades that followed, it became de rigueur for middle-class car owners. In the 1970s a Volvo 145 estate was the vehicle of choice in The Good Life, a sitcom set in London’s commuter belt. At the culmination of Richard Curtis’s hit film Notting Hill, it is an estate car, a Peugeot 406, that speeds the endearing posho Hugh Grant, five friends and a wheelchair through central London to his film-star lover. Tom Leathes, the chief executive of car selling website Motorway, said estate cars – which make up 7% of its sales – are still in high demand because of their fuel efficiency compared with the more popular SUVs. He added that used prices for the V60 had increased by 2% quarter on quarter. “There is still high demand from our dealer partners to stock their forecourts with these modern-day classics,” he said. The V60 and V90 are both available as plug-in hybrids, which have mid-sized batteries capable of about 50 miles of electric driving before the petrol engine is required. That gives the cars much better fuel economy than traditional petrol cars under test conditions, although in the real world the efficiency and environmental benefits are often limited because customers fail to plug them in. It is unclear whether the Volvo estate will survive into the fully electric age, given that all of its electric models so far have been SUVs. Volvo, which is controlled by the Chinese conglomerate Geely, said it does not comment on future model plans. Volvo said: “When operating in a fast-moving industry, we continually re-evaluate our product portfolio to ensure we have the right mix to serve all our customers. As part of this process, it is not uncommon for us to remove certain models or derivatives from sale and reintroduce them later.”",

        "title": "‘It was a nightmare. It still is’: the cost of doing business, eight years after Brexit",
        "content": "Exactly eight years ago, the UK went to the polls and voted to leave the EU. Ending a union that had begun in 1973, the decision was bound to have a profound impact on businesses both in the UK and on the continent. The exit from the single market – which ensured the free movement of goods, services and people between the UK and EU – in 2021 has hit all aspects of industry, from trade to hiring workers. A report just last week by the Centre for Economic Performance concluded that Brexit had had a negative effect on UK trade, with exports and imports lower than they were in 2016 in real terms, having shrunk by 1% and 2% respectively. According to the report, trade with the EU has declined less than many economists expected overall, and some sectors of the UK economy, such as services, have continued to be successful. However, many other business sectors have not fared as well. Whether it is UK clothing exports dropping by a fifth since 2019, or the 56% fall in poultry exports, many sectors are still adjusting to a life outside the EU. The tail of Brexit continues to wag, as new border checks since April have led to fears of more disruption, with estimates putting the cost to businesses bringing in food and plant products at £2bn. And the reverberations are still being felt by businesses large and small. To mark the eighth anniversary of the referendum, the Observer spoke to six companies in the UK and the EU to see how Brexit has affected their business. ‘There are now 50 more steps’ Royal Lemkes, plant exporter, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands “There are now about 50 more steps that we have to take now on exports compared with before Brexit,” says Maurits Philippo, business unit manager at Dutch flower exporter Royal Lemkes. The company is based in Bleiswijk, and sources and transports plants to Ikea and B&amp;Q in the UK. Its subsidiary Floréac supplies smaller independent garden centres across Britain. The company, which has a turnover of €275m, exports to 31 countries, but the decision by its third biggest foreign market to leave the EU has resulted in significant changes to its operations. Philippo says that before Brexit the only real difference between trading with the UK and other EU countries was the exchange rate. Now, the process includes customs declaration forms, plant health certificates and nearly 50 other additional post-Brexit actions. “We had to make changes in our IT system, and brought in two extra staff just to work on just exports to Britain,” he says. It also now leases its own distribution centre in East Yorkshire because of Brexit. Royal Lemkes decided to continue supplying the UK. Others simply gave up. “A lot of smaller export companies, where only a small percentage of trade went to Britain, stopped supplying,” says Philippo. “They said, ‘this looks too difficult, this will never work, we will focus on our French or German customers’.” For Philippo, the extra costs are the most significant impact for importers. And these costs increased further on 30 April with the introduction of new border checks on many plant and animal products coming into Britain from the continent. Under the new rules, some loads are sent to border posts along the coast, with companies charged for the process. Often, the posts can have different charging structures. “This makes it difficult to know what the final charge will be, and eventually those will go onto our cost prices and finally on to the [British] consumer,” he says. He adds that some Dutch exporters are reporting instances of plants being damaged or delayed during the checks at these posts, resulting in lost revenue. “With these new checks, companies are saying it is too complicated, and after several years’ trading with the UK, they are stopping,” he says. ‘Brexit has made us busy’ MDDP, legal firm, Warsaw, Poland While it may have been sold by some as a way of cutting red tape, Britain’s exit from the single market has presented numerous new rules for exports and imports. This has led to an increased demand for lawyers and customs agents to help confused businesses navigate the new landscape. “Brexit has made us really busy,” says Agnieszka Kisielewska, international trade and tax partner at Warsaw-based law firm MDDP. In 2020, the business saw the number of customers seeking trade advice double. In 2021, the number of customers more than doubled again, and MDDP had to increase its trade team by a quarter. One of the best known tax advisers in Poland, the firm’s expansion has coincided with a boom in Polish trade with the UK since Brexit. Total bilateral trade hit £31.2bn in 2023, up 28% on 2019, while the value of imports reached £20.5bn, up more than 29% from four years earlier. Kisielewska says this growth has also led to more Polish businesses seeking advice on how to set up warehouses in the UK. “Polish companies want to keep customers in the UK as happy as they were before Brexit, and one of the solutions has been to set up warehouses so they can supply customers more quickly,” she says. The new customs rules, excise duty and VAT regulations have led to some struggles, but she believes Poland’s location on the edge of the EU and experience of trade with non-EU nations have left it more prepared than some other countries. “We are used to exporting outside the EU and have only been in the union for 20 years, so most companies have knowledge of life before the EU,” Kisielewska says. ‘Hugely expensive’ Wack’s Wicked Plants, carnivorous plant trader, Yorkshire, England When Peter and Helleentje Walker were preparing for the Chelsea flower show last year, they were quietly confident, having previously won three gold medals at the event. However, just weeks before they were to travel down to London from their base in Scampston, they were forced to pull out due to Brexit rules. “The new rules meant we couldn’t get hold of plants we needed,” he says. After meeting in the Netherlands in the 1980s, the Walkers began their Wack’s Wicked Plant business, which specialises in carnivorous plants, with just one polytunnel 12 years ago. Today, they have six. Before the Brexit vote, they had steadily increased exports and begun building a reputation across the EU. Since leaving the single market, they haven’t exported anything. “Before, you just needed a plant passport and that was it. Now you need [phytosanitary] inspections that are hugely expensive,” says Peter. “If we have a customer from Spain who wants five plants for £70, it might cost £80 for the inspection – nobody is going to pay that,” adds Helleentje. But the biggest headache for the Walkers has been new barriers for bringing in plants. Most of their stock begins life in Europe as young plants before being grown in their polytunnels. Many are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites). Before Brexit, no paperwork or checks were needed to bring Cites plants to Britain from the EU. “All of a sudden, sarracenias and Venus flytraps, our two bestselling plants, needed licences and permits before they could be brought in,” Peter says, referring to when Cites controls were implemented last year. Since then, they say, they have been “banging their heads against the wall” for 15 months with the authorities, sometimes waiting up to six weeks for the right documentation for deliveries. This came to a head last May when they had to pull out of Chelsea because of Cites issues. “I’ve never experienced anything as stressful as what happened when Cites came in,” Peter says. “It was an absolute nightmare. It still is.” ‘We dumped our UK supplier’ Denroy, manufacturer, Bangor, Northern Ireland There are very few companies that can list components for Typhoon jet fighters and salon-standard hair brushes in the range of products they manufacture. Northern Irish company Denroy can do just that. Founded more than 50 years ago in Bangor as an injection moulding company, its Denman brush shot to fame in the 1960s after Vidal Sassoon declared it the perfect brush for blowdrying hair. Since then, 3m Denman brushes have been sold globally and the £30m turnover company has diversified to supply wing components for Airbus and Bombardier, among other things. It is confident that it can double its turnover in four years. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, says Kevin McNamee, Denroy’s chief executive, “we really have the best of both worlds. We have free, unencumbered movement of products manufactured to EU standards into any EU country, while also being guaranteed unfettered access into Great Britain.” He adds that, while politicians don’t like to say it publicly, Northern Irish companies have a “competitive advantage” over those in Great Britain when it comes to trade. For goods coming to Northern Ireland from Great Britain, paperwork must still be provided to show they comply with EU laws, and won’t travel beyond Northern Ireland. The Brexit fallout has caused other problems for British firms that want to send products to Northern Ireland. Products manufactured in the UK can be exported to Northern Ireland and the EU with zero tariffs, under the UK-EU trade and cooperation agreement. However, EU rules of origin regulations mean that products being sent from the UK that have originated outside the UK or EU could be subject to tariffs. This can make it less attractive for some Northern Irish firms to trade with Great Britain over EU countries where the tariffs don’t apply. “In the year or so after Brexit, we paid tens of thousands of pounds on tariffs,” he says. “In some cases, we simply re-sourced the supply, so unfortunately the GB supplier got dumped and we went directly to the EU to avoid tariffs.” ‘Customs no longer applies’ Kingsland Drinks, wine bottler, Greater Manchester, England On the outskirts of Manchester, next to the ship canal in Irlam, sits the Kingsland Drinks bottling plant. Employing about 450 people, Kingsland’s main business is importing huge 24,000-litre bags of wine from across the globe, bottling it, and shipping it to supermarkets and retailers. Approximately 80% of the wine it receives comes from the New World regions, with the majority of that from Australia and New Zealand. With so much of its business focused on these markets, it has seen some tangible benefits of trade deals with the two countries since Brexit. The deals, struck in December 2021, removed tariffs on all goods, and were sold as a huge post-Brexit bonus. “Our customers and the end users have seen the benefits, because EU common customs applied on wines from both countries and now they don’t,” says Ed Baker, the managing director at Kingsland. The company expects to save about £1.1m in customs duty on the wine it imports from New Zealand in the first year of the deals, and £3.2m from Australian imports. But while Brexit has reduced costs for consumers with one hand, it has heaped on costs with the other. The new post-Brexit alcohol duty regime saw excise duty on most bottles of wine increase by 44p in August last year. “For an Australian wine you might lose between 7.5p and 9p on the removal of tariffs but you’ll be paying 44p more on excise duty, and that’s ignoring the extra VAT too,” says Baker. These rules will be altered again from February 2025 when the amount of duty paid on each bottle of wine rises even further, up by 2p for every 0.1% increase in strength. This means that bottles of wine with the highest alcohol by volume could see an extra 43p added next year. ‘This has scuppered it’ Amber Violins, musical instrument trader, Gloucestershire, England As a trader in secondhand violins, cellos and bows, Amber Violins is reliant on the EU for both sourcing and selling goods. Before Brexit, its owner and only full-time staff member, Matthew Gryspeerdt, used to travel regularly to France to dealers where he would pick up the instruments and bring them back to auction on his website. Before Brexit, importers only had to pay VAT on the margin of the sale, but since Brexit everything imported, even if secondhand, is charged at full VAT. “So if I buy for £100 I’ve got to sell for £120 before I start to make anything myself – so that margin, which was my profit margin, that has disappeared,” he says. “I had developed the business to a stage where I was putting them onto the auction website and selling around 1,000 units a year,” says Gryspeerdt. Since Brexit, the website has gone, with the number of instruments sold each year down to about 40. “I now focus a lot more on the higher-value and more expensive items to cut down on the bureaucracy,” he says. “Brexit completely scuppered it, really. I basically couldn’t bring stuff in without a shipping agent, and that wasn’t feasible for a small business like mine.”",

        "content": "Brian Chesky, the CEO of Airbnb, just made a very honest admission: “It is true that a company’s not a family,” he said in a recent podcast interview. “We used to refer to ourselves as a family, and then we did have to fire people, or they’d have to leave the company, and you don’t fire members of your family.” Whenever a CEO says their employees are “family”, they’re lying. Your company is not your family. But don’t be disheartened. Your employer does care about you. Really, they do. And it’s been my experience that the smaller the company you work for, the more the owners care about their employees. But this “caring” only goes so far. That’s a good thing. You should thank the gods that you’re not part of “a family”. I know this because I work with a bunch of family-owned businesses. Sometimes it ain’t great. This is not to say that some family-owned firms aren’t excellent. I have one client, for example, that’s owned by three brothers who are extremely close and work well together. Sure, they have their fights and sometimes plates are thrown. But for the most part they – and their wives and their children – are doing fine, and so is their company. I have another client – a trucking firm – that has four generations of family workers in the business and, thanks to the foresight of the very smart father and mother who founded the firm, must adhere to nepotism, succession and other rules that were set up long ago by an independent committee of their board of directors. Then there’s the construction equipment manufacturer that’s owned by two sisters who get along swimmingly. Their husbands even golf together. The families are close. This is good. I can give more examples of successful family-owned companies. But, unfortunately, there are just as many bad family situations. Not Soprano bad, but still pretty bad. Like the member of one of Fresno, California’s most affluent and politically powerful family businesses who sued his father and uncles, alleging fraud, mismanagement and “a pattern of racketeering activity”. Or, in a real-life Succession plot, there are the members of the Goldman family, heirs to a real estate empire, who filed a lawsuit against the youngest daughter of the company’s founder, accusing her of sidelining them and mismanaging the company’s billion-dollar portfolio. There’s the “family conflict” at a well-known Cuban restaurant in Los Angeles that reportedly led to the closure of the near-50-year-old spot after details emerged that that the son owed the mother more than $350,000. The owner of a North Carolina barbecue restaurant was sued by his sister and brother-in-law, alleging that they were “cheated” out of $300,000 to open the establishment. There’s also the sister of an NFL team owner who went to court accusing that brother of “misogynistic” and “financially ruinous” business practices. Even famous families feud over business. Beyoncé fired her father for “taking funds he was not entitled to” from a 2011 tour. The Biden, Trump and Kardashian family businesses are a minefield of infighting, lawsuits and intrigues. Over the years, the Waltons, Guccis, Redstones, Hefners and Murdochs have gone to war with each other. Still want to be part of the family? I didn’t think so. Family members who own a business have problems that their employees cannot even begin to comprehend. And it’s always about the money. When a brother buys a new house, it’s guaranteed that one of the sisters-in-law somewhere will raise an eyebrow. When a family member draws too much out of the firm, his siblings (and their spouses) are bound to demand an equal share. When the drunk cousin fails to show up to work for three days, who’s going to tell him? When the divorced wife – or the mistress – of the philandering father decides to sue for more alimony and damages, where’s the money going to come from? I’m just scratching the surface. You don’t want this. You don’t want to be part of the corporate “family”. Chesky’s right: your company is not your family. Enjoy your status as a third-party, unrelated, arms-length worker. Do a great job. Come to work on time. Have a great attitude. Then collect your paycheck and go home to your own crazy family.",

        "title": "Tories did not lay waste the economy, but the myth suits Labour’s campaign message | Larry Elliott",
        "content": "Labour will win by a mile but is coming to power at the worst possible moment. The economy has been laid waste by the Conservatives, who have deployed a scorched earth policy that will ensure the incoming government has the inheritance from hell. That, at least, is the conventional wisdom, a view that Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have done nothing to counter. There is a reason for that. It suits Labour’s campaign message to paint the blackest possible picture so that it can blame the Tories for any tough decisions they have to make. Even so, the conventional wisdom is wrong. Without in any way minimising the challenges Starmer and Reeves face, this is actually not a bad time to be arriving in office. Sure, excessively high interest rates threaten to derail the UK’s fledgling recovery. No question, years of weak productivity growth, coupled with the cost of a pandemic, and a cost of living crisis have left the public finances in a mess. Nobody would dispute that the economy is in a worse state than it was the last time Labour emerged from opposition in 1997. Covid has left deep and permanent scars. That said, the new government will have a number of things going for it. For a start, expectations are at such a rock-bottom level that it won’t take much to exceed them. The desire of voters to get rid of the Tories does not appear to be matched by a similar enthusiasm for what Labour is offering. Faith in politicians of all stripes is at a low ebb, so nobody is anticipating much. Then there’s the fact that the Tories have been forced to clear up their own mess rather than – as was the case in 1964 and 1974 – leaving Labour to do the dirty work. And, to be fair, Sunak has made a reasonably good fist of it. It is not really true that the Tories have been laying waste the economy. On the contrary, Sunak and Jeremy Hunt have taken some extremely unpopular decisions – the six-year freeze on tax allowances, for example – to reduce public borrowing. Given the chaos they inherited from Liz Truss, they perhaps had little option but to play things straight, but Hunt’s decision to provide firms with permanent 100% tax relief on investment spending was a smart move. It addresses one of the economy’s enduring weaknesses and should bear fruit over time, helping Labour more than it has the Conservatives. At the end of 2022, shortly after Truss left office, the Bank of England was expecting the longest recession in 100 years, one lasting from the summer of 2022 to the middle of this year. The economy did end up in recession, but it was a short-lived and shallow affair lasting just two quarters and nothing like as severe as slumps of the past. All things considered, the economy held up a lot better to higher interest rates and rising taxes than the Bank feared. The current state of the economy also suggests there is going to be a post-election bounce. Household budgets are much less stretched than they were a year ago because pay is rising faster than prices. That’s insufficient to make good the losses suffered earlier in this parliament, but it does mean consumer confidence is on the up. There is evidence from the latest S&amp;P snapshot of the economy that households have been putting off spending decisions until after the election. Sooner or later, the Bank of England will decide the time is right to reduce interest rates. Theadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee kept interest rates on hold at 5.25% this week but signalled that cheaper borrowing costs may not be that long in coming: either in August or September. The fact that some of the seven members who voted for no change said the decision was “finely balanced” could mean the former. The Bank accepts that the 14 interest rate increases between December 2021 and August 2023 are dampening activity, and its policy stance will remain restrictive even when rates start to come down. But the fact that the Bank is likely to move shortly after Labour arrives in power will reduce borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. This should cement the idea that a change of government has had a positive effect. Interest rates could be as low as 3% by the end of 2025. Nor is Reeves as boxed in by fiscal policy as is assumed. She is committed to the same debt rule as Hunt – namely that debt as a share of national income should be falling at the end of a rolling five-year period. But as Andrew Goodwin, of the Oxford Economics consultancy, points out, the measure of debt used includes the impact of the cost of the Treasury indemnifying the Bank of England for losses when it sells UK bonds gilts bought under the money creation scheme known as quantitative easing. Tweaking the debt rule to exclude these payments would give Reeves an extra £20bn to play with, and it would be a major surprise – and a missed opportunity – were she not to announce the change in an autumn budget. The way things are shaping up, that budget will take place with the Conservative party in turmoil following a defeat of historic proportions. Unless there is another Covid-like shock to the economy, Labour will be able to plan for two full terms in office. If tough decisions are needed – as they probably will be – Starmer and Reeves can say that is a price that sadly has to be paid after 14 years of Tory incompetence.",

        "title": "This timid ‘Ming vase’ strategy won’t turn Labour into a dynasty | William Keegan",
        "content": "Are you familiar, dear reader, with the “Ming vase” strategy? It seems to be a commonplace in inner Labour party pre-election discussion. It refers to the way that the man who is on the verge of being prime minister, and his chancellor to be, Rachel Reeves, are being so depressingly cautious in their electoral commitments that many natural Labour voters are asking themselves: what is the point? Enter stage left Sir Keir Starmer, who has been told about the advice Roy Jenkins gave to Tony Blair in the run-up to the 1997 election. At that time, Labour were way ahead in the polls, but haunted by the fact that after “13 wasted Tory years” (1951 to 1964), Harold Wilson had only just won the 1964 election. Even more daunting was the collective folk memory of how the party had been misled by the polls into expecting to win in 1992, when the Tories, under John Major, made a successful last-minute dash to the winning post – undoubtedly helped by the ditching of Margaret Thatcher in 1990. In the run-up to 1997, Jenkins, who had become a kind of mentor to Blair, had compared the latter’s position to that of someone entrusted with the perilous task of carrying a priceless Ming vase across a highly polished floor: one slip could herald disaster! A leader of the opposition on the approach to Downing Street finds that he has lots of friends he didn’t know about, and no shortage of advice. Some of this is evidently coming to Starmer from Blair, who seems to have passed on the Ming vase advice. (Those of us who knew Jenkins regard it as a characteristically Jenkinsian analogy.) The obvious concern for the many who want Starmer and Reeves to be a lot bolder once they assume office is: suppose they mean what they are saying? Suppose, having crossed the polished floor and not dropped the vase, they continue to stick by the present government’s anti-growth fiscal rules, and persist in ruling out rejoining the European customs union and the single market? And this at a time when the greatly respected British Social Attitudes Survey finds that just 24% of respondents say Britain should remain outside the EU. The Labour leadership tell us they want growth. It is growth that is meant to finance the industrial and NHS revival which might rescue us from the continuation of austerity – which the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation tell us is built into the economic forecasts for the next few years on largely unchanged policies. “Unchanged” essentially means ruling out increases in the major revenue earners – income tax, VAT and national insurance – and keeping fiscal rules which don’t allow sufficient flexibility for borrowing for long-term projects. Blair’s mantra in 1997 was “education, education, education”. Starmer and Reeves’s equivalent is “investment, investment, investment”. However, for all the goodwill being generated by Starmer and Reeves with the private sector, what is being offered on the investment front so far is small beer – £7.3bn or so over the next parliament. By contrast, Sir Brian Unwin, a former head of the European Investment Bank, points out that, during our membership of the EU, the EIB invested £150bn for infrastructure and other projects in the UK, about £6bn a year – not an entire parliament – leading to linked investment of two or three times that by the private sector. In that last, fatal referendum year of 2016, the EIB devoted £7.5bn to the UK, including expenditure on improving our sewage system. The thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, in common with the OBR, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and Goldman Sachs, calculates the annual loss to our potential output at about £140bn, with losses of vital tax revenues of about £40bn a year. By being recalcitrant over Europe, says UK in a Changing Europe, Labour has ruled out changes that would have brought the biggest boost to investment and growth. They are “tinkering around the edges of the current relationship with the EU”, and doing little “to address the continuing economic impact of Brexit”. All this being said, one just has to hope that a large majority – if that is what it is to be – stiffens Starmer’s arm. Good riddance to the insanely ideological rightwing Brexiter Tories who have brought this once great nation to its knees. Meanwhile, conscious that I may upset some readers with my criticisms of the leadership’s approach, I nevertheless feel the need to register yet another cavil while I am at it. It is this: there seems to be a general assumption that Labour will be in for two terms, and will have time to come into their own during the second term. But how can they be so sure in these disturbing geopolitical times?",

        "content": "American Airlines’ CEO Robert Isom has said the airline – the world’s largest – will implement new measures, including an advisory group, after eight Black passengers were wrongly removed from a Phoenix to New York flight after a complaint about body odor. The removal caused outrage, and three of the passengers involved in the January incident – who were not seated together and did not know each other – sued the carrier. They said in a statement that “American Airlines singled us out for being black, embarrassed us, and humiliated us”. In a note to employees, Isom said that the passengers’ treatment was unacceptable and that the company “fell short of our commitments and failed our customers”. He also said the airline was committed to working with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, to “rebuild trust”. “I am incredibly disappointed by what happened on that flight and the breakdown of our procedures,” Isom wrote. “We fell short of our commitments and failed our customers in this incident.” The airline said in a statement that it was “holding those involved accountable, including removing team members from service”. The airline is also updating its process for handling customer allegations of discrimination or bias as well as criteria for removing passengers from a flight. The civil rights group had previously advised Black travelers to avoid the airline over “discriminatory” behavior and “corporate culture of racial insensitivity and possible racial bias”. That 2017 travel advisory has since been lifted, but the group has warned that it could be reinstated if the airline did not deliver a “swift and decisive response” to the situation. On Thursday, the group said in a statement to the Washington Post that it “is pleased to see American Airlines has taken initial steps to forge a path toward a more inclusive experience for all” but noted that “it is unfortunately common for Black consumers to experience racism and discrimination at the hands of corporations”. Separately, a settlement of the lawsuit appears to be in the works after a recent court filing said the plaintiffs and the airline “have agreed to engage in settlement discussions”.",

        "title": "FAA investigating after Southwest plane flies 525ft above Oklahoma town",
        "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a Southwest Airlines fight after it flew several hundred feet above a neighborhood in Yukon, Oklahoma. Shortly after 12am on Wednesday, Southwest flight 4069 – a Boeing 737 from Las Vegas – was approximately nine miles away from Oklahoma City’s Will Rogers World airport when it dipped to approximately 525ft above Yukon, according to flight data from Flightradar24.com. The descent prompted a low-altitude alert from an air-traffic controller. In a recording reported by LiveATC.net, an air-traffic controller can be heard saying: “Southwest 4069, low-altitude alert. You good out there?” “Yeah, we’re going around, 4069,” the pilot responds. The air-traffic controller can then be heard instructing the pilot to ascend to an altitude of 3,000 feet. The plane eventually landed safely at the airport with no injuries reported. Nevertheless, the low descent startled several residents including Spencer Basoco, who lives close to Yukon high school, where the flight is reported to have hit its lowest altitude, according to KFOR. Speaking to KFOR, Basoco said: “I was kind of like halfway in between sleep, being awake, and I just hear this whoosh … And I thought at first, like a storm was blowing in … because it just sounded like a wall of wind. And I looked out the window where the sound was coming from … if you go a few blocks away is the high school. And I just see a plane.” Posting in the Yukon Happenings Facebook group, one resident wrote: “It woke me up and I thought it was gonna hit my house,” the Oklahoman reports. Following the incident, the FAA said in a statement: “After an automated warning sounded, an air-traffic controller alerted the crew of Southwest Airlines Flight 4069 that the aircraft had descended to a low altitude nine miles away from Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City.” It added that it was investigating the incident. In a statement reported by the Associated Press, Southwest Airlines said: “Southwest is following its robust safety management system and is in contact with the Federal Aviation Administration to understand and address any irregularities with the aircraft’s approach to the airport. “Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees,” the airline added. Southwest’s latest incident follows reports of the FAA investigating another one of its flights after a Boeing 737 plunged at a rate of 4,000ft a minute off the coast of Hawaii in April. According to a memo distributed to the airline’s pilots and reviewed by Bloomberg, the plane was en route to Honolulu from Lihue when it rapidly descended to approximately 400ft above the Pacific Ocean. The airline had another incident in May when a Boeing 737 suffered damage to parts of its structure after it did a “Dutch roll” during a flight in May. A Dutch roll occurs when a plane’s tail slides side to side while its wings roll up and down. The plane was bound from Phoenix, Arizona, to Oakland, California, and was flying at approximately 34,000ft when the incident happened. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, Southwest “performed maintenance on the airplane and discovered damage to structural components”.",

        "title": "UK consumers seek £382m from salmon producers in price-fixing case",
        "content": "A legal firm is seeking £382m on behalf of British consumers from some of the world’s largest salmon producers, which are accused of price fixing. Legal action filed this week at the competition appeal tribunal said UK consumers overpaid for at least four years because of alleged breaches of competition law by the fish firms Mowi and its subsidiary Mowi Holdings, SalMar, Lerøy, Scottish Sea Farms and Grieg. In January this year, the European Commission issued a preliminary ruling that the Norwegian-owned producers Lerøy and SalMar, which jointly own Scottish Sea Farms, as well as Grieg, Mowi and two other producers, Cermaq and Bremnes, had breached competition rules by colluding on the sale of Atlantic salmon in Europe between 2011 and 2019. Senior executives at those companies allegedly planned to rig prices via email correspondence, and at various meetings and “working dinners”. The action, filed by the legal firm Simmons and Simmons, claims that the alleged cartel’s behaviour drove up the price of farmed Atlantic salmon by as much as 20% above the levels it would otherwise have been. Millions of consumers who bought the salmon for personal consumption between October 2015 and May 2019 are eligible to join the action. Anne Heal, the former director of regulatory affairs at BT, has been appointed as head of Waterside, a group set up to lead the claim. She previously headed the Thames Water customer challenge group, an independent body that represents the interests of the utility firm’s customers. Heal said: “This action claims that some of the Atlantic salmon farming industry’s biggest companies have conspired to raid the wallets of hard-working shoppers. “This action aims to seek fair redress for the millions of British consumers who we say spent years overpaying for one of the UK’s favourite and highly nutritious foods.” The proceeding is being funded by Erso Capital, a litigation funder, and the action is insured. Class members will not be at risk of paying any fees or the defendants’ costs if the proceedings are unsuccessful. The action on behalf of British consumers comes after solicitors acting for seven UK supermarkets, including Asda, Marks &amp; Spencer, Morrisons and the Co-op, instructed lawyers to seek £675m in compensation for losses arising from the alleged salmon price-fixing by their suppliers named in the EU preliminary finding and Scottish Sea Farms. That claim was filed at the competition appeal tribunal in February. In May last year, several of the companies – Mowi, Grieg, Lerøy, SalMar and Cermaq – agreed to pay £67.2m ($85m) to settle a three-year class action by clients in the US over the same price-fixing claims. In December, Mowi, SalMar, Grieg Seafood, Cermaq and Lerøy agreed to pay more than £3m to their customers, including retailers, in Canada. Mowi said it has not been involved in any anti-competitive conduct and believed the allegations in the Waterside case were unfounded. Grieg Seafood said it had not yet received the latest lawsuit but denied any anti-trust infringements or anti-competitive behaviour and said it would “exercise all our rights of defence”. A Salmar spokesperson said: “SalMar is aware of the planned legal action on behalf of the UK consumers. SalMar disputes strongly the allegations of price fixing and notes that the European Commission has not reached any final decision on its investigation. SalMar contests all of these allegations and will defend vigorously any legal proceedings brought against it in the UK.” The other three producers have been approached for comment.",

        "title": "Tata Steel workers in South Wales to begin indefinite strike next month – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up, here are today’s main stories: The Labour party has been drawing up options for how it could raise money through extra wealth taxes to help rebuild Britain’s public services if it wins the general election, according to sources who have spoken to the Guardian. The proposals under consideration include increases in capital gains tax (CGT), first revealed by the Guardian two weeks ago, that could raise £8bn. Another option under discussion could lead to significant changes to inheritance tax. The measure would make it more difficult to “gift” money and assets, such as farmland, tax free. Together with CGT increases it could raise up to £10bn in revenue, according to one document seen by the Guardian. A senior Labour source said: “We are starting from ground zero with our public services and infrastructure. We have to show we are serious about borrowing and raising revenue from taxes if investors are going to walk in step with us. These measures are part of unlocking wealth and putting it to work.” Back in the economics world, output across the US private sector has hit a 26-month high this month. The monthly ‘flash’ survey of US purchasing managers has found that US business activity growth accelerated to its fastest for 26 months in June, led by the service sector. This has lifted the Flash US PMI composite output index up to 54.6, from May’s 54.5, which shows a faster expansion. The survey also found that employment rose for the first time in three months, and optimism about output in the year ahead edged up to a three-month high. Chris Williamson, chief business Eeonomist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence says: “The early PMI data signal the fastest economic expansion for over two years in June, hinting at an encouragingly robust end to the second quarter while at the same time inflation pressures have cooled. The PMI is running at a level broadly consistent with the economy growing at an annualized rate of just under 2.5%. The upturn is broad-based, as rising demand continues to filter through the economy. Although led by the service sector, reflecting strong domestic spending, the expansion is being supported by an ongoing recovery in manufacturing, which so far this year is enjoying its best growth spell for two years. In other union news, the UK’s biggest trade union has officially backed the campaign for a four-day working week. Delegates at Unison’s annual conference in Brighton demanded the next government takes action to ensure more employers adopt the new way of working. Christina McAnea, Unison’s general secretary, said: “Offering truly flexible work patterns, including a four-day week, can help employers recruit and retain staff. “Organisations who’ve tried this approach tend to have happier staff, who are more focused at work, which boosts productivity. “The rise of artificial intelligence could make a four-day week inevitable. What’s needed is a rethink on how workplaces are organised, as well as progressive policies that future-proof people’s livelihoods and protect their wellbeing. “The pandemic proved that people could do their jobs from home and still be efficient. A four-day working week is the next big step.” The Tata strike begins the Monday after the general election, so will be an early hot potato for the next government. Labour has signalled that it could reverse the agreement struck with Tata, if it wins the election. The shadow Welsh secretary, Jo Stevens, said earlier this month: “We have repeatedly said no irreversible decisions should be made before polling day. Labour’s plans for a steel fund will ensure the future of the industry is fuelled by the skills, talent and ambition of Welsh steelworkers.” Newsflash: Around 1,500 Tata workers based in Port Talbot and Llanwern will begin all-out indefinite strike action next month over the company’s plans to cut 2,800 jobs and close its blast furnaces, the Unite union have announced. Unite say the strike which begins on 8 July, is the first strike action by UK steel workers in 40 years. They say it will “severely impact” Tata’s UK operations. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Tata’s workers are not just fighting for their jobs - they are fighting for the future of their communities and the future of steel in Wales. “Our members will not standby while this immensely wealthy conglomerate tries to throw Port Talbot and Llanwern on the scrapheap so it can boost its operations abroad. They know South Wales is ideally placed to take advantage of the coming boom in green steel – if the right choices are made. “The strikes will go on until Tata halts its disastrous plans. Unite is backing Tata’s workers to the hilt in their historic battle to save the Welsh steel industry and give it the bright future it deserves.” Unite threatened to ramp up industrial action at the South Wales steelworks earlier this month. On Tuesday, staff began an overtime ban and “work to rule”. The dispute centres on a deal struck in January, under which Tata will receive £500m in state subsidies to help with the move to new “greener” furnaces. The deal also involved starting to close blast furnaces from this month, triggering job losses. Tata rejected a union proposal under which a blast furnace would have remained in operation while an electric arc furnace – which processes scrap steel - was built, saving jobs. Without a blast furnace at Port Talbot, the UK would be the only major economy unable to make steel from scratch. There’s more takeover drama in the City today. Following Carlsberg’s attempt to buy Britvic (see earlier post), enterprise software firm Crimson Tide is now facing two rival proposal. Kent-based Crimson Tide has told the City that it has rejected a second share-based approach from rival Checkit. But it has also pondering a proposal from another rival, Ideagen, which is worth £20m in cash or 312p per Crimson Tide share. On this latter proposal, Crimson Tide says: The Board is considering the Ideagen Proposal and further updates will be provided as appropriate. This announcement is made without the consent of Ideagen and there can at this stage be no certainty that any firm offer will be made by Ideagen nor as to the terms of any firm offer. Shares of Crimson Tide have jumped 52% today, to 275p. The company makes a software package called mpro5 software, which is designed to improve the efficiency of staff working &amp; capturing data out in the field, such as an engineer or a nurse. The euro is a little lower today too, after this morning’s PMI surveys showed the eurozone recovery faltering this month. It’s trading around $1.069 against the dollar. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, says: The Eurozone PMI has established itself as a reliable leading indicator of economic activity, and the latest data shows serious risks of a slowdown. This is bad news for the European currency. EURUSD slipped below 1.0700, almost duplicating last Friday’s lows just below 1.0670. European stock markets are ending the week in the red. The UK’s FTSE 100 index has dropped by 47 points, or 0.6%, so far today to 8,225 points, having hit a near-two-week high yesterday. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 have both lost around 0.5%, following losses in New York last night (including a drop for investors’ favourite Nvidia). Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, reports: European stock markets faded a tad early on Friday, mirroring a move in the US with little in the way of meaningful drivers for price action. The S&amp;P 500 rose as much as 0.34% but ended the day down 0.25%, with Nvidia down 3.5%. Crude oil eased back a bit after touching its highest since May 1st. Gold pushed up to a two-week high. Today’s weak French PMI report has reminded investors of the economic challenges facing the eurozone’s second-largest member. And there are already concerns that the French national assembly elections could result in a government that pushes up spending, spooking financial markets already concerned about the size of France’s annual budget deficit and its rising national debt. In the energy sector, Octopus Energy is poised to repay the UK government almost £3bn to cover the state support it received to take over the collapsed supplier Bulb. Octopus will reimburse the government by September in a move that will enable the Treasury to effectively claw back almost all the costs of temporarily nationalising Bulb. Bulb collapsed in 2021 after it was forced to sell energy at a loss when wholesale prices spiked above the price cap set by the regulator, Ofgem. The government stepped in to ensure its 1.6 million customers still received energy and Bulb was taken into state control temporarily under the special administration regime. In late 2022, Bulb was sold to Octopus, which is the UK’s second largest energy supplier, with billions of pounds of taxpayer support in a sales process run by the UK government and Teneo, which acted as special administrator to Bulb. Today’s UK PMI report also shows there was a slight increase in jobs among service providers this month, while goods producers trimmed their workforces. The pound has dipped to its lowest level against the US dollar in over a month. Sterling has lost a quarter of a cent today to $1.2630, adding to the half-a-cent drop recorded on Thursday. Predictions that the Bank of England could cut interest rates as soon as August are weighing, after the BoE revealed that yesterday’s decision to hold rates was ‘finely balanced’ for some of its policymakers. The Bank of England won’t find much cheer in today’s UK PMI report. The slowdown in the economy could put pressure on policymakers to consider cuts to interest rates – a decision they resisted yesterday, when Bank Rate was left at 5.25%. But the PMI report shows that inflationary pressures are building up this month, with companies lifting their prices at the fastest rate in four months. That seems to be driven by a rise in input costs, as “severe global shipping constraints led to higher transport costs”. The report says: The uptick in services charge inflation was the first recorded since February, with firms generally highlighting the need to cover their costs via increased selling prices. Factory gate prices rose solidly and to the greatest extent since May 2023. Eurozone bond yields have dropped this morning, after the latest PMI data showed weak company growth in Germany in June, and a contraction in France’s private sector. That may indicate that traders believe further cuts in eurozone interest rates are more likely, to support the economy. Yields, which measure the rate of return on a bond, fall when prices rise. Reuters has the details: German 10-year bond yields, the benchmark for the euro area, fell 4.5 basis points to 2.38% and were set to end the week 2 bps higher. The gap between French and German 10-year yields - a gauge of risk premium investors demand to hold French government bonds – was at 72 bps, after hitting 82.34 bps last Friday, its highest level since February 2017. “OATs (French government bonds) look priced for a hung parliament/RN-lead with a benign fiscal outcome but might widen sharply to 100 bps over Bunds on a more forceful far-right/left manifesto implementation, while tightening to 60 bps on a centrist coalition,” Citi analysts said. Meanwhile in Germany, business activity is only rising marginally this month. The German economy has been hit by “a solid and accelerated drop in manufacturing production” this month, the latest PMI report shows. The Germany Composite PMI Output Index has fallen to 50.6, a two-month low, down from May’s 52.4. That’s only just above stagnation…. Election uncertainty also hit France’s economy this month, today’s PMI reports show. France’s private sector economy endured a challenging month in June, S&amp;P Global reports, with activity shrinking again in June. The headline HCOB Flash France Composite PMI Output Index fell to 48.2 in June, from 48.9 in May, which shows a deeper contraction. Today’s French PMI report shows: Employment growth eased to a three-month low, while backlogs of work fell at an accelerated pace. There was also a drop in business confidence, which reflected renewed concerns towards the outlook due to uncertainty arising from the upcoming election. June’s composite PMI report suggests the UK economic recovery lost a bit of momentum towards the end of the second quarter, reports Capital Economics. They also point out that service sector prices have risen this month: And after two stronger-than-expected inflation prints for April and May, the renewed pick-up in the services output balance will be a bit disappointing for the Bank of England. This may not prevent an interest rate cut from 5.25% to 5.00% at the August meeting, but the risk is that rate cuts thereafter may be a bit more gradual than we currently expect. Julian Jessop, economist at the Institute for Economic Affairs, points out that the UK private sector is still growing… and doing slightly better than the eurozone: Newsflash: Britain’s service sector has been hit by a slowdown this month, as election anxiety hit the economy. Data provider S&amp;P Global reports that service sector growth hit a seven-month low this month, which also dragged growth across the private sector to its lowest since last November. Service sector firms reported that the slowdown was partly driven by a pause in client spending decisions during the election period, after Rishi Sunak’s shock decision in late May to call a general election. That suggests political uncertainty has dampened business spending this month. In better news, manufacturers registered the sharpest rise in production levels for over two years, helped by a pick-up in new orders. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says: “Flash PMI survey data for June signal a slowing in the pace of economic growth, indicating that GDP is now growing at a sluggish quarterly rate of just over 0.1%. The slowdown in part reflects uncertainty around the business environment in the lead up to the general election, with many firms seeing a hiatus in decision making pending clarity on various policies. Here’s the key findings from June’s ‘flash’ survey of purchasing managers (a reading of 50 = stagnation). Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index at 51.7 (May: 53.0). 7-month low. Flash UK Services PMI Business Activity Index at 51.2 (May: 52.9). 7-month low. Flash UK Manufacturing Output Index at 54.2 (May: 53.4). 26-month high. Flash UK Manufacturing PMI at 51.4 (May: 51.2). 23-month high This rather dampens the feel-good factor from early this morning, when retail sales jumped in May and consumer confidence rose. In another worrying sign, inflationary pressures were back on the rise during June, as companies widely reported a steep increase in transport costs linked to global shipping bottlenecks. And business optimism also fell this month. The PMI report says: The flash survey data pointed to a weaker level of business confidence regarding future output at UK companies in June, which qualitative evidence showed was fuelled by political uncertainty ahead of the general election. Sentiment at services firms was especially affected, dropping to its lowest level for seven months. Over in the eurozone, the economic recovery has suffered a setback this month as firms report a drop in new business. The latest survey of eurozone purchasing managers has found that new orders decreased for the first time in four months in June, leading to slower rises in business activity and employment levels. Worryingly, business confidence dipped to the lowest since February. This has pulled the HCOB Flash Eurozone Composite PMI Output Index down to 50.8 points this month, a three-month low, down from May’s 52.2. Any reading over 50 shows growth. The manufacturing sector fell into a deeper contraction this month, while service sector growth slowed. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, says: “Is the recovery in the manufacturing sector ending before it began? Both we and the market consensus anticipated that the increase in the index in May would be followed by another rise in June, potentially setting the stage for an upward trend. However, rather than moving closer to expansionary territory, the HCOB Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI reading fell, dashing hopes for a recovery. This setback was compounded by the fact that new orders, which typically serve as a good indicator of near-term activity, fell at a much faster rate than in May. This rapid decline in new orders suggests that a recovery may be further off than initially expected The EY ITEM Club has forecast that UK retail sales will improve in the second half of this year, and in 2025, thanks to falling inflation. Following the pickup in sales volumes in May, they say: Tighter fiscal policy and the lagged effect of past interest rate rises remain headwinds to stronger spending. But inflation has fallen back much more quickly than pay growth, which means households are now benefiting from a healthy boost to real incomes. Newsflash: soft drinks maker Britvic has rejected two takeover approaches from Danish brewer Carlsberg. Britvic has turned down an offer of £12.50 pence per share this week, which would value it at £3.1bn, having already rejected an initial proposal of £12 from Carlsberg earlier this month Britvic told the City this morning: The Board together with its advisers carefully considered the Second Proposal, and concluded that it significantly undervalues Britvic, and its current and future prospects. Accordingly, the Board unanimously rejected the Second Proposal on 17 June 2024. Shares in Britvic have jumped by 15% this morning, to £11.69. Carlsberg has confirmed it has made two approaches, and points out that the £12.50/share offer is a 29% premium to Britvic’s closing share price on Wednesday. Carlsberg says it is considering its position, and says: Carlsberg believes that the Proposal represents a compelling opportunity for Britvic shareholders to realise their investment in full in cash at an attractive valuation. Could the jump in clothes shopping last month have anything to do with Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, which began this month and runs until August? Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, suspects Swifties have been snapping up new outfits ready for the concerts. She writes: UK retail sales surged last month, and core retail sales that exclude auto fuel rose at a 1.2% annualized pace in May, after falling by 2.5% in April. The ONS said that sales rebounded after a wet April, and sales volumes grew across most sectors, with clothing and furniture sales rebounding strongly. Could this be the Taylor Swift effect, with people (including myself) splurging on new outfits ahead of her era’s tour, the UK leg of which is set to add £1 billion to the UK economy? There is no denying that today’s retail sales report paints a positive picture for the UK consumer, Brooke adds: Non -food store sales rose by 3.5% in May, the highest level since April 2021, and online sales surged by 5.9%, the highest monthly increase since April 2022. The ONS did caveat the boost to sales compared to a year ago, by reminding us that last May there was an extra bank holiday for the King’s Coronation. However, after a slump at the end of spring, the consumer looks to be back as the UK finally moves towards summer. With inflation falling back to target and consumer confidence improving, UK retail sales may well continue to strengthen, predicts Capital Economics: They told clients: The 2.9% m/m increase in retail sales volumes in May fully reversed the 1.8% m/m drop in April (revised up from -2.3%) as rainfall fell back more in line with seasonal norms. Indeed, the increase on the month was supported by a 5.4% m/m increase in clothing sales. But the strength was broad-based across the retail sector including online (+5.9% m/m) suggesting an underlying strengthening in sales beyond weather effects. Online clothes shopping is finally recovering, after a slump, reports Tom Youldon, partner at McKinsey &amp; Company. He says UK retail sales have “bounced back” in May (see intro for the details), and suggests the Euros could support spending. With inflation down to the Bank’s 2% target, consumer confidence at the highest level since November 2021 and a 2.9% increase in retail sales volumes, consumer activity is picking up. “In particular, online trading in apparel is finally recovering, with textile, clothing and footwear online sales rising 9.8%. Activity was likely boosted by the May bank holidays and some willingness from shoppers to splurge on discretionary goods. Although sales volumes overall still remain slightly below pre-COVID-19 levels. “As we head into warmer months, retailers will be hopeful that falling inflation and rising wages will act as a further boost to GfK’s measure of consumer confidence. And that a combination of drier, sunnier weather, big sporting events like UEFA Euro 2024 and summer holiday purchases encourage greater spending at the tills. England’s performance yesterday could easily have boosted demand for headache pills, for starters…. The UK public finances report shows that central government’s receipts rose by £1bn in May, year-on-year, to £76.8bn. That includes a £2bn rise in tax receipts, lifted by increased Income Tax, Corporation Tax and Value Added Tax (VAT) receipts. But compulsory social contributions fell by £900m, due to the cuts to the main rates of National Insurance. The latest public finances data shows that the UK’s net debt as a percentage of GDP remains at levels last seen in the early 1960s. The ONS reported this morning that public sector net debt excluding public sector banks was provisionally estimated at 99.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of May. That’s 3.7 percentage points higher than a year ago. In historic terms, it’s a level last seen in 1961, when Harold Macmillan was prime minister and the UK was paying off the debt incurred in the second world war. As flagged in the introduction, the UK borrowed another £15bn in May. Although that’s £800m more than a year ago, it’s £600m lower than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. British consumer sentiment has risen to a two-and-a-half year high this month, market research company GfK reports this morning. The GfK consumer confidence survey has risen to -14 in June, up from from May’s -17, the highest reading since November 2021. That may well have fed through to the increased retail sales spending last month. The survey found that households have a more optimistic view of the economic situation over the last 12 months, and the outlook for the next year. However, people grew gloomier about their own personal finances, highlighting that times are tough even though inflation has fallen back to 2%. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, explains: Those measures on the economy registered sharp increases of seven points and six points respectively, and there was a welcome three-point boost in intentions to make major purchases. While June’s reading of -14 is the third month in a row that confidence has increased, the headline score remains negative owing to the difficulties so many have experienced as the unrelenting cost-of-living crisis batters household budgets. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Today we will be digesting the final slug of significant economic data ahead of the UK general election, which have just been released. The latest retail sales figures show that consumer spending picked up last month, while new borrowing statistics are casting a light on the public finances. May’s retail sales stats show that sales volumes rebounded in May, after a slump in April when bad weather drove shoppers from the high street. That’s rather stronger than the 1.5% rise forecast by City economists. Retail sales volumes jumped by 2.9% in May 2024, following a fall of 1.8% in April, the Office for National Statistics reports. The ONS says: Sales volumes rose across most sectors, with clothing retailers and furniture stores rebounding following poor weather in April. Last month was the warmest May on record, in a series going back to 1884, according to the Met Office. More broadly, sales volumes rose by 1.0% in the three months to May 2024 when compared with the previous three months, the ONS adds. Retail sales volumes rose across all main sectors, the ONS says. The biggest growth was seen among “non-store retailers”, such as online shops, where volumes jumped by 5.9% on the month. At department stores, clothing outlets, household goods sellers, and other non-food stores, volumes rose by 3.5% in May. These increases suggest people feel more confident about economic conditions – as shown by the latest poll of consumer confidence from GfK. But while that may bolster Rishi Sunak’s claim that the economy is turning the corner, this isn’t providing the PM with a poll boost…. The public finances, meanwhile, show that the UK borrowed £15bn in May to cover the difference between governent spending and income. That’s a little lower than forecast, but £800m more than in May 2023. It’s the third highest May borrowing since monthly records began in 1993.

        "title": "Steelworkers to strike over Tata’s plans to cut 2,800 jobs in south Wales",
        "content": "About 1,500 Tata Steel workers at two south Wales steelworks are to begin strike action next month in protest at the company’s plans to cut 2,800 jobs and close its blast furnaces. The situation has become a general election issue, with Labour calling for Tata to halt its plans and wait until after the 4 July vote to engage in talks with the government, saying there is a “better deal to do”. The workers based in Port Talbot and Llanwern who are members of the Unite union will begin all-out indefinite strike action on 8 July, the union announced on Friday. It is the first strike action by steelworkers in the UK for more than 40 years, it said, adding that Tata UK’s operations would be severely affected. Unite said previously it decided to strike after Tata threatened to cut redundancy pay as a response to members voting for an overtime ban. On Tuesday the workers then began the overtime ban and started working to rule, where staff do no more than the minimum required by the rules of their job. Labour has pledged “a bright future” for UK steel, backed by £3bn funding if it is elected next month. The party has also promised to prioritise emergency talks with Tata. Tata rejected a trade union plan this year designed to keep Port Talbot’s blast furnaces running, with their closure putting 2,800 jobs at risk and leaving the UK on course to become the only major economy unable to make steel from scratch, Unite said. The company told workers’ representatives in January that it could no longer afford to continue production at the loss-making Port Talbot plant while it completed a four-year transition plan towards greener production. Tata said operating the old furnaces meant it was losing £1m a day. Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary, said on Friday: “Tata’s workers are not just fighting for their jobs – they are fighting for the future of their communities and the future of steel in Wales. “Our members will not stand by while this immensely wealthy conglomerate tries to throw Port Talbot and Llanwern on the scrapheap so it can boost its operations abroad. They know south Wales is ideally placed to take advantage of the coming boom in green steel – if the right choices are made. “The strikes will go on until Tata halts its disastrous plans. Unite is backing Tata’s workers to the hilt in their historic battle to save the Welsh steel industry and give it the bright future it deserves.” A Tata Steel spokesperson said: “We are extremely disappointed by Unite’s unilateral decision to call strike action. “Our existing steelmaking assets are near the end of their life, are operationally unstable and causing unsustainable losses of £1m a day. This is why preparations to close the blast furnaces and associated plants in Port Talbot are unchanged. However, if the safety and stability of our operations are put at risk by this action, we will be forced to accelerate those closure plans. “After extensive negotiations with our unions we substantially improved our support offering for affected employees – the most generous package in our history. Rather than taking strike action, we would have expected Unite to put our improved offer to its members, as previously accepted by all unions, including Unite.”",

        "title": "Whoever wins the French elections must beware of the markets",
        "content": "“It’s a big deal, of course it’s a big deal,” says Sophie Montanari, emerging from the Métro at Notre Dame de Lorette in central Paris to talk about her struggles to make ends meet. “We never used to have trouble at the end of the month. Now we do. It’ll certainly influence our vote.” A shop worker married to a plumber, with three children under nine, Montanari, 37, said she had recently gone back to full-time working from three days a week. “I’m not sure the politicians realise how much more expensive life is now for families since Covid,” she said. “Almost everything – electricity, gas, basic foods like pasta. I’m not decided yet. But I’ll be looking carefully at what they plan to do about it.” Emmanuel Macron, like Rishi Sunak, has called a snap election, which will be held over the two weekends that straddle polling day in the UK. Like the British prime minister, the French president is taking a gamble that at this stage does not appear to be going entirely to plan. Voters, unhappy about the state of the French economy, are abandoning the parties of the centre in favour of those of the right and the left. Anti-government sentiment is running high. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, says: “France has suffered from all the problems the rest of Europe and the developed world more generally has been suffering from: the pandemic, the energy shock, relatively weak productivity, an economy that is not growing very much, insecurity. “There are big economic problems that are contributing to people’s discontent.” Assib Hamadi, 45, a deputy hotel manager, is one of those who have lost patience with Macron. He says the cost of living is his “number one priority” and one of the main reasons why he does not plan to vote for President Macron’s centrist party, as he had done in 2017 and 2022. “He hasn’t done enough,” says Hamadi. “And it’s going to get worse this year – gas is going up in July, electricity later. They say inflation’s down but I’m certainly not feeling it. That’s the first job of a government, isn’t it? Make sure everyone can get by.” Although France has recorded one of the lowest cumulative inflation rates in the EU since 2019, polls show the cost of living is voters’ top concern. Politicians have taken the message on board, with all three main contenders in the snap elections – National Rally (RN), the left-green New Popular Front (NFP) alliance and Macron’s Renaissance – promising relief. But the prospect of higher spending whatever the outcome of the election has spooked financial markets already concerned about the size of France’s annual budget deficit and its rising national debt. Last week, the European Commission opened a disciplinary case over France’s failure to stick by the EU’s tough budget rules. These stipulate that member states run budget deficits of no more than 3% of annual income. Last year, France ran a 5.5% budget deficit and, despite some planned spending cuts by Macron’s government, it will decline only modestly over the next few years. The International Monetary Fund estimates that by 2027 the deficit will still be 4.5% of GDP – far too high as far as Brussels is concerned. The Washington-based IMF says France needs a fresh dose of austerity to get Brussels off its back. That, though, was an assessment made before the elections to the European parliament, in which the RN topped the poll. That prompted a sharp sell-off in French bonds and shares, raising the prospect of a Liz Truss moment: a government that pursues economic policies that alarm the financial markets, and pays a heavy price for doing so. Bruno Le Maire, France’s economy minister, name-checked Britain’s short-lived prime minister as he sought to warn voters of the risks of voting for RN. “A Liz Truss-style scenario is possible,” he says. Gabriel Attal, the prime minister, on Thursday described his rivals’ plans as “a leap into the unknown, from a great height, without a parachute”. Kenningham says the state of the French public finances is the country’s biggest headache. When monetary union was launched a quarter of a century ago, Germany and France had similar sized national debt at 60% of GDP. Since then, Kenningham says, Germany’s debt to GDP ratio has remained virtually the same whereas France’s has almost doubled, to 110% of GDP. “At a time when there is a need to make deficit cuts, electing a party whose main platform involves a very big increase in the deficit is asking for trouble. Investors are not going to want to lend a lot of money to the French government.” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, says there are four possible election scenarios: a hung parliament in which no party has an overall majority; a government dominated by the RN that softens its policy stance; an RN government that sticks to its past agenda and picks fights with the EU; and a left government that pursues a radical agenda of price freezes on food and energy, reduces the pension age to 60 and introduces a wealth tax. “Under any of our scenarios, France will likely have to live with a higher yield spread over Germany, lower trend growth and some ratings downgrades in the future. Over time, all three factors would exacerbate France’s fiscal challenges.” Aware of the risk of a fresh fall in French bonds and shares should the markets take fright at some of their proposals, RN and NFP have sought to present themselves as responsible economic managers. NFP has said its budget deficit will not exceed that of the present government, with measures such as lowering the retirement age back to 60 funded by stronger economic growth and higher tax revenues from those better off. RN has said that if it wins it will be “reasonable, realistic and responsible”, acknowledging that all of its economic plans, which also include returning the retirement age to 60, will not be achievable straight away, or even soon. Business leaders remain to be convinced. Medef, France’s equivalent of the CBI, said last week that the proposals of “some parties” were likely to weaken France economically and lead to financial instability. “The result will be crucial to the creation of an economic future in which companies can prosper and create jobs.” For some analysts the current state of French politics is reminiscent of the early 1980s, when the newly elected socialist president François Mitterrand, who arrived in office on a platform that included nationalisation, wealth taxes and a higher minimum wage was forced – under intense pressure from the markets – into an austerity U-turn within two years. Philippe Ledent, senior economist at ING bank, says: “Today, budgetary and debt problems are greater, growth potential is lower and the duties incumbent on each member state of the monetary union are even stricter.” In Ledent’s view, a leftwing or a rightwing government would have to choose between provoking an economic, financial and institutional crisis or heavily watering down its initial programme. “The examples of Greece in the early 2010s, and more recently of Italy, tend to show that the second option will eventually prevail,” he says.",

        "content": "Octopus Energy is poised to repay the UK government almost £3bn to cover the state support it received to take over the collapsed energy supplier Bulb. Octopus will reimburse the government by September in a move that will enable the Treasury to effectively claw back almost all the costs of temporarily nationalising Bulb. Bulb collapsed in 2021 after it was forced to sell energy at a loss when wholesale prices spiked above the price cap set by the regulator, Ofgem. The government stepped in to ensure its 1.6 million customers still received energy and Bulb was taken into state control temporarily under the special administration regime. In late 2022, Bulb was sold to Octopus, which is the UK’s second largest energy supplier, with billions of pounds of taxpayer support in a sales process run by the UK government and Teneo, which acted as special administrator to Bulb. The repayment of the state support, first reported by the Financial Times, comes as a result of an agreement when the takeover was struck under which Octopus would repay the state support by the end of this year, or extend the agreement into 2025. The Octopus deal prompted accusations of unfairness from rivals ScottishPower, British Gas and E.ON. The energy companies brought a high court judicial review last year against the UK government, claiming that its decision-making process was flawed in allowing the Bulb sale to go ahead. However, the high court rejected the legal challenge and ruled that the sale process had been conducted as an “open, non-discriminatory and competitive bidding process”. The Bulb bailout was at one time estimated to be the UK’s most expensive rescue since the 2008 financial crisis with one figure putting taxpayer support to be as high as £6bn. However, this was revised downwards as energy costs fell, and the Office for Budget Responsibility last March put the cost of the rescue at £3bn. The structure of the deal struck by the Treasury with Octopus effectively means that the bailout of Bulb is costing the government almost nothing. Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus, said: “This outcome is a great result for taxpayers. Octopus worked hard in the darkest depths of the energy crisis to create a fair deal, meaning that although Bulb went bust with billions of liabilities, it has cost the government almost nothing.” Earlier this year, Octopus reported its first annual profit since it was formed in 2015. It has 6.9 million customers in the UK.",

Lawyers acting for Sellafield told Westminster magistrates’ court on Thursday that cybersecurity requirements were “not sufficiently adhered to for a period” at the vast nuclear waste dump in Cumbria. The charges relate to information technology security offences spanning a four-year period from 2019 to 2023. It emerged in March that the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) intended to prosecute Sellafield for technology security offences. Late last year the Guardian’s Nuclear Leaks investigation revealed a catalogue of IT failings at the site dating back several years. Sellafield pleaded guilty to a charge that it had failed to “ensure that there was adequate protection of sensitive nuclear information on its information technology network”, the Financial Times reported. The Guardian reported last year that the site systems had been hacked by groups linked to Russia and China in December last year, embedding sleeper malware that could lurk and be used to spy or attack systems. At the time, Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack. Paul Greaney KC, acting for Sellafield, told the court: “It is important to emphasise there was not and has never been a successful cyber-attack on Sellafield.” Greaney added that Sellafield’s systems were now robust and said media reports of hacks were “false”. An ONR spokesperson said: “We acknowledge that Sellafield Limited has pleaded guilty to all charges. “There is no evidence that any vulnerabilities have been exploited,” the spokesperson said, adding that due to ongoing legal proceedings the ONR could not offer further detail at this time. Sentencing is expected to take place on 8 August. The site has the largest store of plutonium in the world and is a sprawling rubbish dump for nuclear waste from weapons programmes and decades of atomic power generation. The Guardian investigation revealed a string of IT issues, including concerns about external contractors being able to plug memory sticks into its computer system while unsupervised. The investigation found problems had been known by senior figures at the nuclear site for at least a decade, according to a report dated from 2012, which warned there were “critical security vulnerabilities” that needed to be addressed urgently. Sellafield’s computer servers were deemed so insecure that the problem was nicknamed Voldemort after the Harry Potter villain, according to a government official familiar with the ONR investigation and IT failings at the site, because it was so sensitive and dangerous. At the time, Sellafield said that “all of our systems and servers have multiple layers of protection”. “Critical networks that enable us to operate safely are isolated from our general IT network, meaning an attack on our IT system would not penetrate these,” a spokesperson said. Britain’s public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, launched an investigation into risks and costs at Sellafield earlier this year. A spokesperson for Sellafield said: “We have pleaded guilty to all charges and cooperated fully with ONR throughout this process. The charges relate to historic offences and there is no suggestion that public safety was compromised. “As the issue remains the subject of active court proceedings, we are unable to comment further.”",

        "content": "Britvic, the UK soft drinks maker, has rejected a £3.1bn takeover proposal by Carlsberg Group, the Danish brewer, which it said undervalued the company. Britvic shares jumped on Friday after the drinks company, whose brands include J20 and Robinsons, said Carlsberg had made two takeover proposals this month, with the last cash offer at £12.50 a share. Shares were up 8% at £10.92 on Friday afternoon. The FTSE 250 company said its board had rejected the proposal made on 11 June as well as an earlier approach of £12 a share received on 6 June after concluding that it undervalued Britvic. Under takeover rules, Carlsberg must indicate its intention to make a formal offer for Britvic by 19 July or walk away. Britvic has an exclusive licence with PepsiCo in Great Britain and Ireland to make and sell Pepsi Max, 7UP, Rockstar Energy and Lipton Ice Tea. The company was founded in the UK in the 1930s as the British Vitamin Products Company and used soft drinks as an affordable way of supplying vitamins to consumers. It now has 39 brands in 100 countries including Brazil, France and Ireland. The company reported strong revenue growth in May underpinned by demand from its products from international markets including Brazil. It announced a £75m share buyback programme and said revenue for the six months ended 31 March rose by 11% to £880m – up from £794m in the same period a year earlier and interim pre-tax profits rose by 10% to £60m. Britvic is also well known for its Robinsons brand, which had a sponsorship partnership with the Wimbledon tennis tournament that ended in 2022 after 86 years. Robinsons had been an independent company until it was acquired by Britvic in 1995. Robinsons’ association with Wimbledon dated to 1935, when a drink containing barley, lemon juice and sugar was made for the tennis players at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in a year when the British player Fred Perry won the gentlemen’s singles title. The barley water drink was created by Eric Smedley Hodgson and handed out to players and umpires during a visit to Wimbledon. It was so popular that he was invited back every year.",

        "title": "Warmer weather and falling UK inflation lift retail sales",
        "content": "Spending in shops and online bounced back strongly last month as better weather, falling inflation and rising consumer confidence boosted spending. The monthly update from the Office for National Statistics showed the volume of retail sales rose by 2.9% in May, after a weather-affected drop of 1.8% in April. The ONS said most retailers had a better month in May, with marked increases in the clothing and footwear and household goods sectors. Clothing sales rose by 5.4% as retailers managed to shift summer stock. Kathleen Brooks, a research director at XTB, said the strength of clothing sales might have been influenced by one-off events. “Could this be the Taylor Swift effect, with people – including myself – splurging on new outfits ahead of her Eras tour, the UK leg of which is set to add £1bn to the UK economy?” The official data followed the release of the latest snapshot of consumer confidence from GfK showing sentiment standing at its highest level in two and a half years. Over the three months to May – a better guide to the underlying trend in spending – retail sales rose by 1%. Even so, they remained 0.5% below the level immediately before the start of the Covid pandemic in February 2020. Retail sales account for less than half of total consumer spending and exclude categories such as car sales, eating out and hotel stays. The broader monthly health check on the economy by S&amp;P found the pace of growth eased in June after Rishi Sunak called a snap election. The S&amp;P purchasing managers’ index showed activity was growing at its slowest pace in seven months, with the weakness concentrated in the service sector. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: “Flash PMI survey data for June signal a slowing in the pace of economic growth, indicating that GDP is now growing at a sluggish quarterly rate of just over 0.1%. “The slowdown in part reflects uncertainty around the business environment in the lead-up to the general election, with many firms seeing a hiatus in decision-making pending clarity on various policies.” The PMI composite output index fell from 53.0 in May to 51.7 in June. A reading above 50 indicates the economy is expanding rather than contracting. Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macro, said the fall in the PMI was an election-related blip. “Retail sales rebounded strongly from April’s rain-sodden disaster and will keep gaining ground as consumers’ real wage growth drives higher spending. “The incessant rainfall didn’t stop in May but precipitation was ‘only’ 20% above average, compared to 68% above in April. May was also the warmest since at least 1884.” Andrew Wishart, a senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the fact that online sales were up by 5.9% month on month suggested there was more to the May increase than simply better weather attracting shoppers back to high streets. “Overall, the retail sales data for May showed tentative signs that strengthening real income growth now inflation is back at target is feeding through to stronger spending,” Wishart said. Separate ONS figures highlighted the size of the fiscal challenge facing the next government, with the gap between public spending and tax receipts standing at £15bn last month – £800m higher than a year earlier and the third highest for a May since modern records began in 1993. Spending last month was £2.3bn higher than in May 2023, while a £1.5bn increase in tax receipts was partly offset by weaker national insurance contributions after the cuts in the autumn statement and the budget. May’s £15bn borrowing figure was slightly lower than the £15.7bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s spending watchdog. April’s borrowing was revised down by £2.1bn to £18.4bn.",

        "title": "‘People have gone bust’: the small business owners struggling to pay back Covid loans",
        "content": "Jess Christman, who runs a Scottish timber business, recalls that banks were “throwing money” at him during the Covid-19 pandemic as Rishi Sunak, then the chancellor, sought to help small companies stave off collapse. Christman, who runs Black Isle Firewood, near Inverness, which produces firewood and sawn timber and huts for the tourism market, ended up taking out a government-backed loan under the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS). However, he had been struggling to repay the money because the economy remained “in the doldrums” until his lender, Close Brothers, allowed him to extend the length of his loan from five to nine years. “CBILs were a lifeline. I would have had to shut the business without them,” he said of the firm he founded in 2010 after he leaving previous job at a housing association. “The business had been running along fine before Covid. But since then things have not picked up. It’s been pretty quiet because the economy is not doing well and people have been sitting on their hands. My lender was willing to extend and so I was lucky. I know people who have gone bust as a result of CBILs,” he added. CBILs were one of three main packages of £77bn of government-backed pandemic loan support disbursed under emergency conditions to pump money into small firms and prevent economic collapse. The loans by banks and other financial institutions were administered by the state-owned British Business Bank (BBB) and lenders made decisions on applications. Four years after the pandemic, many smaller businesses are struggling to repay these loans due to the economic downturn and higher inflation, which has reduced sales and pushed up costs in wages and energy bills. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), a trade association that represents small firms, believes those who took out CBILs should be given more flexibility to pay them back, with higher debts hampering investment. The best-known scheme was the bounce back loan programme, launched in May 2020 as a life support for small businesses during lockdown. It offered fully government-guaranteed bank loans of up to £50,000 or 25% of turnover. Paperwork was minimal; applications were self-certified and there were no credit checks. A quarter of all businesses made use of this scheme but it has since proved controversial with an estimated £1.8bn in loans flagged as suspected fraud. UK companies drew £46.59bn through the bounce back scheme, with 74% of loans by volume fully repaid or on track for repayment. However, lenders have resorted to the government payback guarantee for about 18% of all bounce back loans by volume – with a value of about £9bn as of December 2023 – mainly because businesses have gone bust. CBILs were offered up to £5m for businesses with a turnover under £45m and loans were 80% government-backed. Companies drew £25.84bn, with 91% of CBILs by volume currently repaid or on track for repayment. The government guarantee has so far been called on for 5.35% of the CBILs by volume. The third scheme, the coronavirus larger business interruption loan scheme (CLBILS), was aimed at companies with annual turnover of more than £45m. Businesses struggling to repay bounce back loans can access a “pay-as-you-grow” scheme giving flexibility including repayment holidays or extending loan terms up to 10 years. About 34% of businesses with bounce back loans have taken up pay-as-you-grow options. However, there is no such formal scheme available to businesses with CBILs – any loan extension is purely at the discretion of the bank. Martin McTague, the FSB national chair, said: “While CBILS was a vital part of the initial support brought in to help businesses stay afloat during the pandemic, we warned at the time that the lack of flexibility around repayment terms would store up problems for the future. “We asked for CBILS loans to be offered some of the same pay-as-you-grow help that bounce back loan applicants were given. Some CBILS loans had a floating rate of interest, and then interest rates have soared far higher than those taking out a CBILS loan at the time could have forecast. “These higher repayment costs for thousands of small firms come at a time of higher energy bills, a rising tax burden, and increased wage costs.” Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the trade body UKHospitality, said: “One of the many obstacles to growth for the hospitality sector after the pandemic has been the repayment of Covid-related loans, with high interest rates increasing payments and making it hugely challenging for many businesses to thrive in the challenging economic climate. “This is yet another cost that limits investment into the sector and we continue to urge the government to allow refinancing of these loans to enable repayments over a longer time period and without penalties. This would offer affected businesses the support they need to survive in the medium to long term, and it also frees up capital for further investment in hospitality, serving Britain’s wider economy a much-needed boost.” John Donald, 73, whose Edinburgh-based firm Robop took out a £160,000 CBILS loan in 2020, began struggling when he was faced with £3,000-a-month repayments from 2021, when his business was still slow to recover. Donald co-founded the company, which supplies a patented autonomous robot that looks like a Peregrine falcon and deters birds from nesting on buildings. Customers include Network Rail and Caterpillar. “We founded the business a day after 9/11 and we have been through economic shocks before including the 2008 financial crisis and the 2016 Brexit vote where we saw our UK orders fall. But up until the pandemic we were growing at 330% a year,” Donald said. “We assumed it would take six months to recover from the pandemic. Once repayments started and money was not coming in we really struggled and wanted to extend the terms but that did not happen.” Eventually, administrators were appointed and the firm went into insolvency in 2022. Donald bought back some of the assets and has set up a new firm, Robop Systems Engineering. Some firms are still struggling to repay bounce back loans even though firms have access to a more lenient repayment schemes. The Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs Business Debtline, which helps struggling firms, said 35% of its clients had bounce back loan debt, owing an average of £25,434. Jane Tully, Money Advice Trust’s director of external affairs and partnerships, said: “The financial fallout from Covid is still having an impact on many small businesses, a situation that’s been worsened by the high cost of living. Our advisers at Business Debtline are hearing from people now struggling to repay loans, including bounce back loans, taken out during the pandemic.” Dave Hughes, 62, who runs Hotbox, a not-for-profit music venue in Chelmsford, said he had struggled to repay a £50,000 bounce back loan partly because other costs had risen including rent. He set up the venue seven years ago after a career in business, when his son was studying music at university. “ I always wanted to have a music venue,” he said. “But the last two years have been tough. We were closed during Covid for the best part of two years … Then inflation went through the roof and electricity costs have gone up and also people spend less. “I was completely debt-free pre-Covid. We have been landed with debt through no fault of our own.” The British Business Bank said: “Where CBILS borrowers are in difficulty, in many cases lenders can extend the original loan terms to a maximum of 10 years if they need help to reduce monthly repayments. We would strongly encourage those who need this extra help to speak to their lender.” The UK government said: “We have amended the loan rules to give lenders the option to extend terms from six to a maximum of 10 years, to help borrowers in need of financial assistance reduce their monthly payments and repay their loan. “During the pandemic, we also covered interest payments for the first 12 months of borrowing for CBILS borrowers, helping thousands of businesses stay afloat.” However, many believe further action is now needed. McTague said: “What was the point of supporting these businesses through the disruption of Covid, to the tune of billions of pounds, if we allow them to go to the wall now – and with their debts unpaid? Helping them to repay their CBILS debts on a schedule that’s manageable is surely much more sensible for all sides.”",

        "title": "The future is delayed at Ocado (again) | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "Close your eyes and you might have thought Ocado was announcing good news. Both its partners in North America, Kroger in the US and Sobeys in Canada, have announced “strong growth in digital sales” in their latest quarterly updates, the UK firm said excitedly. But, oh dear. What Thursday’s statement was really relaying was that Sobeys, like Kroger last year, has hit the pause button on opening more warehouses filled with Ocado’s robots. A fourth Canadian “customer fulfilment centre” (CFC), due to open in Vancouver next year, will be delayed, even though it is mostly built. Cue a 12% plunge in Ocado’s share price to 310p, a level not seen since 2017, the year the UK group started signing deals with overseas supermarket chains and invited investors to start thinking of it as a supplier of whizzy automated technology to the world, as opposed to a domestic online grocer struggling to make a profit. The pitch worked splendidly during the pandemic when everybody wanted shopping delivered to the door. As Ocado’s shares soared to the heights of £29, briefly making the company more valuable than Tesco, founder and chief executive Tim Steiner declared that “a dramatic and permanent shift towards online grocery shopping” was taking place. The reality was very different. Demand calmed down post-pandemic, as the hubristic Steiner should have suspected it would. The question became one of online’s progress under normal conditions. Answer: not as fast as hoped. Sobeys’ parent company, Empire, spelled it out: “Once e-commerce penetration rates in Canada increase, the company will be in a position to make a decision quickly on when it will proceed with the opening of its fourth CFC.” Delay is not cancellation, obviously. On the other hand, Sobeys is also paying a small sum to end its mutual exclusivity agreement with Ocado early, which hardly screams long-term enthusiasm. Whistling cheerfully, Ocado said its group-wide target to generate positive cashflow “in the midterm” is intact. But this latest example of delays will merely add to the impression that Ocado is a place where the medium-term seems perpetually to lie around the next corner. It feels like the company has been the future of food retailing for about 20 years already. The short-term reality is a pre-tax loss of £394m last year, after one of £501m on the previous outing. And the entertaining public row with Marks &amp; Spencer continues to bubble away over the final payment for the purchase of one half of the Ocado Retail UK business in 2019. Whatever the financial rights and wrongs of the quarrel, the saga is terrible advertising in Ocado’s home market, the one it calls its “shop window”. Meanwhile, exit from the FTSE 100 index looms. One can, of course, take the “one more heave” view and reflect that Ocado has opened 22 CFCs around the world and still has partnerships with 12 retailers. The promised land of profits, cash generation and wonderful rates of return on mature CFCs may yet materialise. The core shareholders, note, are still showing heroic levels of patience. We can, though, say that pandemic valuation was truly absurd.",

        "content": "The owner of Royal Mail is facing a near £900m class action claim over accusations it abused its “dominant position” in the market for sending out bulk mail, including bank statements and weekly magazines. International Distribution Services (IDS) has been served with an £878m action by a newly formed company that said it represents an estimated 290,000 customers who claim they were overcharged as a result of Royal Mail’s behaviour. Bulk mail is typically sent by businesses and organisations including retailers, utility companies, charities and publishers. It includes council tax and bank statements, charity fundraising appeals, weekly magazines and energy bills. The action, brought by Bulk Mail Claim Limited, argues that businesses and organisations that bought bulk mail services after 2014 suffered owing to “anti-competitive” behaviour by Royal Mail. It argues that Royal Mail prevented competition, pushing up prices for the collection, sorting and delivery of letters in bulk. The class action comes as the billionaire Czech energy tycoon Daniel Křetínský’s EP Group attempts to buy IDS in a £3.57bn deal. In 2018, the industry regulator, Ofcom, fined Royal Mail £50m after it found the company “broke the law by abusing its dominant position in bulk mail delivery”. Ofcom said “Royal Mail’s behaviour was unacceptable and it denied postal users the potential benefits that come from effective competition”. Royal Mail has unsuccessfully attempted to appeal against Ofcom’s decision. It faces a £600m claim, separate from the class action, brought by Whistl, which scaled back its operations in 2015 with the loss of 2,000 jobs. That case is expected to reach the high court next year. Robin Aaronson of Bulk Mail Claim Ltd said: “Where there has been an abuse of dominant position, as has occurred in this case, it is important that those suffering loss are able to obtain redress. “A collective claim is the only fair and efficient form of redress in this case, given that there are hundreds of thousands of affected customers and it would be commercially unviable for them to bring individual proceedings.” Andrew Wanambwa, a partner at Lewis Silkin, the law firm aiding the claimants, said: “Royal Mail abused its dominant position, resulting in hundreds of thousands of bulk mail customers being overcharged. The purpose of this claim is to hold Royal Mail accountable for its actions and secure compensation for affected customers.” Royal Mail said: “We confirm that we have received an application for a collective proceedings order from an entity called Bulk Mail Claim Ltd which we consider to be without merit and we will defend it robustly.” The class action claim has been filed with the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal.",

        "title": "UK parties ignoring food shortage risks, say farming and retail bodies",
        "content": "Farmers and supermarkets have accused the main political parties of ignoring the risk of severe food shortages in Britain, calling the issue a “worrying blind spot” in their general election campaigns. The UK’s main farming and food and drink bodies have joined forces to voice their frustration at the lack of focus on food security by politicians as the attempt to gain votes, despite the headwinds faced by producers. A letter signed by the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) to leaders of the Conservative, Labour and the Liberal Democrat parties said: “The basic responsibility of any government is to ensure its citizens are safe and properly fed. “But while we have heard much about defence and energy security in recent weeks, we have heard very little about food security. “The lack of focus on food in the political narrative during the campaigns demonstrates a worrying blind spot for those that would govern us.” The other signatories to the letter included the Food &amp; Drink Federation (FDF) and UK Hospitality. Farmers have faced multiple recent challenges including extreme weather and escalating production costs that have limited their ability to grow crops. Between October 2022 and March 2024, England experienced its wettest 18-month period since records began in 1836, which left many farms under water and farmers unable to plant crops. Analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit estimates that production of key crops like wheat, barley and oats could fall by a fifth this year because of the wet weather. The NFU’s annual farmer confidence survey recorded that the majority of farmers would decrease production next year. The letter said that, while the UK food system had remained efficient and resilient in recent years in the face of Covid, the Ukraine war and Britain’s exit from the EU, supply chains had come under strain, leaving gaps on some shop shelves. The bodies wrote: “It would be foolhardy to assume that our food system will always withstand shocks, especially against the backdrop of increased geopolitical instability and climate change.” Tom Bradshaw, president of the NFU, said that the signatories of the letter were concerned that food security had not been on the agenda of any of the parties in the first few weeks of campaigning for the 4 July general election. He said that while there were good elements in all the manifestos, the letter’s signatories agreed that stronger commitments were needed if food production was to be protected. The Conservative party has vowed to increase the UK-wide farming budget by £1bn over the parliament if elected, as well as introduce a legally binding food security target for the country. The Liberal Democrats committed to injecting £1bn a year into the farming budget, while also promising more consultation with the sector on trade deals. Labour has failed to put a figure on its farming budget but has promised to publish a trade strategy to promote the highest standards in food production. Bradshaw said there were some “gaping holes” in Labour’s manifesto, which concerned the NFU, in particular not specifying its farming budget if it gained power. He said: “They have written in their manifesto that food security is national security, which we welcome, but we now need to make sure that is underpinned by policies that are going to enable the delivery of that ambition.” The letter from the food groups calls for all parties to commit to an agricultural budget that enables the delivery of environmental objectives, as well as a planning system that allows investment into modern buildings and an approach to trade that reduces friction and tariffs.",

        "title": "Bank of England keeps interest rates at 5.25% in ‘finely balanced’ decision",
        "content": "The Bank of England has held interest rates at 5.25% for the seventh consecutive time in what it described as a “finely balanced” decision. Dashing Rishi Sunak’s hopes of a pre-election cut in the cost of borrowing, a majority of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) said they wanted to see further evidence that price growth would remain subdued. Financial markets expected the decision, despite a fall in inflation in May to the Bank’s 2% target. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said: “It’s good news that inflation has returned to our 2% target. We need to be sure that inflation will stay low and that’s why we’ve decided to hold rates at 5.25% for now.” Bailey was among seven of the nine-member MPC who voted to leave rates on hold. Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden voted for a quarter-point cut to 5%. However, for some of those who voted to freeze rates, the decision was “finely balanced”, according to the minutes of the MPC meeting, suggesting a potential cut had been a serious consideration. Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the Bank had “left the door open” to a rate cut in August. She said the minutes of the MPC meeting showed policymakers wanted to ensure inflationary pressures were receding. “We would interpret [these words] as a sign the Bank is willing to cut rates in August, if the data evolves as it expects,” she said. James Smith, a developed-markets economist at ING, said: “Assuming the next inflation report in mid-July doesn’t contain any nasty surprises, the Bank will vote for a rate cut in August.” Savers will cheer the freeze, but many mortgage payers and indebted small businesses will need to take out loans at historically high levels of interest. Millions of homeowners have been forced to refinance their loans at much higher interest rates in the past 18 months, leading to a collective bill that is likely to reach £12bn by the end of the year, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. David Bharier, the head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce, said a cautious approach by the Bank was preventing business investment. “Rate cuts, when they come, will provide welcome breathing space for the companies we represent across the UK. Our research shows that while business concern about the cost of borrowing has been easing, it remains at historically high levels. Many firms have told us they have been put off from investing due to high borrowing costs, and this has no doubt been a drag on overall economic growth.” The Bank said its own survey of investors showed only 50% believed there would be a cut at the MPC’s meeting in August. Three-quarters of respondents to the survey said they expected a cut in September. Despite the fall in headline inflation to 2% in May, services inflation was 5.7%, down only slightly from 5.9% in April. In the minutes of the MPC meeting, members said the economy had grown faster than they expected earlier this year, and was likely to continue doing so. Bank staff predict GDP growth of 0.5% in the second quarter of 2024, stronger than the 0.2% rate expected at the time of the last rates decision in May. It said some of the growth in the first quarter was accounted for by an increase in government spending, leading to a stronger bounce-back from last year’s recession. MPC members were concerned that wages were not falling fast enough to prevent companies from putting up prices again. A forecast rise in energy prices in autumn could also push inflation higher again.",

        "title": "Pound falls as UK interest rates left on hold in ‘finely balanced’ decision – as it happened",
        "content": "Time for a recap. City economists are predicting the Bank of England will cut interest rates in August, after leaving borrowing costs unchanged today. Several analysts believe the BoE will vote to lower rates at its next meeting, in six weeks time, given signs that inflation is easing. The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee left base rate unchanged today at 5.25%, in a 7-2 split. But the seven MPC members who voted for no change were themselves split, with three reportedly in a group whose vote was finally balanced. This may have included BoE governor Andrew Bailey. James Lynch, fixed income investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, says: “It appears the nine-member committee is in three camps. Two voted for cuts again at this meeting, ‘some’ argue that more evidence of diminishing inflation persistence was needed before reducing rates, and for ‘other’ members the recent news did not alter their view on the disinflationary trajectory we are on. We of course do not know how many is ‘some’ or ‘others’ but given the overall dovishness of the minutes it would appear the ‘some’ might be enough to get the five votes over the line for a cut in August.” The poud weakened below $1.27 against the dollar, while UK bond prices strengthened, and shares rallied in London. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said: “It’s good news that inflation has returned to our 2% target. We need to be sure that inflation will stay low and that’s why we’ve decided to hold rates at 5.25% for now.” Bailey was among seven members of the nine-member MPC who voted to leave rates on hold. Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden voted for a quarter-point cut to 5%. But the Bnak was criticised by the IEA, and the IPPR, for not lowering borrowing costs. Here’s the full story: Analysts at Japanese bank Nomura predict the Bank will cut rates in August – when some of the seven policymakers who voted for no change today will have shifted their vote. They say: While all of the seven members voting for no change agreed that a) policy was weighing on activity, b) the labour market was loosening and c) inflation persistence was moderating, this group split into two distinct camps this time. One camp (“some” members) continued to worry about high services and wage inflation, second-round effects and strong demand – thereby arguing more evidence was needed to be sure that inflation persistence was abating sufficiently. But another camp (“other” members) was at pains to dismiss recent service and wage inflation strength and argued the June decision was finely balanced. While we don’t know how many members were in these camps (nor which Ben Broadbent was in – he leaves the Committee at the end of this month), it does suggest that more MPC members believe it will soon be appropriate to begin cutting rates. Lee Hardman of MUFG says: BoE leaves policy rate on hold for 7th consecutive meeting at 5.25%. The updated communication revealed that more MPC members are moving closer to voting in favour of a rate cut. We are sticking to our forecast for the BoE to begin cutting rates in August. The pound has weakened modestly but we do not expect a significant reversal of pound outperformance so far this year. Criticism is falling on the Bank of England from across the spectrum. Julian Jessop, economics fellow at the right-wing think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, has followed the more progressive-leaning IPPR (see earlier) in saying the BoE should have cut borrowing costs. Jessop says: “The Bank’s decision to leave interest rates on hold despite inflation falling to target is not unreasonable, but it is still wrong. There is already plenty of evidence that underlying cost pressures are easing. The longer the Bank waits, the greater the risk that inflation undershoots the target while unnecessarily holding back the recovery. “Most Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members are not yet confident that pay pressures and services inflation have slowed sufficiently to sound the ‘all clear’. There is a risk that inflation could rise again in the second half of the year. “It would be unfair to accuse the Bank of political bias. But the view of the markets may have influenced the decision. The MPC could have wanted to avoid the perception of bias if they had surprised investors by cutting rates so close to an election. “An August rate cut is still very much in play. The statement noted that a new set of forecasts will allow a more detailed assessment of the risks of inflation persisting. Even some MPC members who voted for no change this week acknowledged that their decision was finely balanced.” We can’t blame the general election campaign for deterring the Bank of England from cutting interest rates today, suggests Daniel Mahoney, UK economist at Handelsbanken. Data, not politics, will have determined the Monetary Policy Committee’s decision, Mahoney says: Even though this decision has taken place during a general election campaigning period, this will not have affected the votes of MPC members. The MPC have been very clear that their decisions at this and other meetings are data dependent. Given there were clearly a number of rate-setters close to joining the two members backing rate cuts, it would seem that the minutes of June’s MPC meeting are indicating that a rate cut in August remains very much on the cards. Indeed, we remain of the view that August will mark the start of the rate cutting cycle, although this prediction is contingent on the next set of labour market and inflation data prints not throwing up any surprises. The Bank of England has disappointed earlier expectations by not starting the rate cutting period today, points out Michael Browne, CIO at Martin Currie. The UK economy is performing better than expected but not enough to justify restrictive rates. Rate cuts will start in the second half of the year and are likely to continue over a long period of time, as the MPC moves cautiously. If the UK enters a period of political certainty after the election with higher for longer rates (and a less stable backdrop in Europe), there will be upside risks to UK Sterling. These factors combined would be helpful to lower inflation. Looking ahead, the Bank of England (BoE) has clearly hinted at a rate cut in August, Browne adds. Here’s the key points from today’s Bank of England decision, from Modupe Adegbembo economist at Jefferies: BoE remained on hold as expected in a ‘finely balanced’ decision. Vote split was 7-2 with Ramsden and Dhingra voting for a cut, and the minutes indicate other members were very close to joining them. It is clear that the MPC wants to cut and begin dialing back the level of restriction in rates and is happy to look though some of the strength in recent services inflation data, as they believe it is not driven by underlying factors. Growth has also been relatively resilient and BoE staff now expect GDP growth of 0.5% this year, up from 0.2% forecast in May, but the MPC will be worried that keeping rates on hold may jeopardize this. We continue to expect a cut from the BoE in August, alongside fresh forecasts and a press conference to allow the Governor to explain the shift in policy. Data will remain important, particularly on services inflation and wages, and the resumption of MPC speeches after the UK election will also be key. The Bank of England is being criticised by the Institute for Public Policy Research for leaving interest rates on hold today, and hurting the economy. Dr George Dibb, associate director for economic policy at IPPR, says: ”The Bank of England has tightened the screws too much for too long, holding back the UK’s economic recovery. It should have followed the European Central Bank by starting to cut rates today. “The Bank has to balance lingering price rises, notably in services, with the UK’s zero economic growth and a cooling labour market. With inflation expectations back down to pre-pandemic levels, it’s time for the Bank to switch gears, support the economy more, and cut rates.” The BBC’s economics editor, Faisal Islam, has some fascinating detail about today’s interest rate decision. His understanding is that there were three members of the MPC whose decision to vote to hold rates today was ‘finely balanced’ (as the Bank put it earlier). That would have made a majority, he points out, if they had allied with Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden who did vote to lower rates, but were outvoted 7-2. This means the pathway to a cut on 1 August seems “pretty solid”, Islam says. Intriguingly, he adds that the group of three waverers “probably includes” Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, and “probably” deputy governor Ben Broadbent too. Broadbent steps down at the end of this month, though, and will be replaced by the OECD’s Clare Lombardelli. Here’s a video clip with more details: It is clear the Bank of England is getting closer to the point of cutting rates, says James Smith, developed markets economist at ING. He told clients today: Assuming the next inflation report in mid-July doesn’t contain any nasty surprises, we still think the Bank will vote for a rate cut in August. Today’s meeting suggests that the BoE is in a similar mindset to the ECB, where it is getting more confident in its inflation forecasting ability and therefore feels able to look through temporary gyrations in underlying CPI data. Bank officials are heavily constrained in what they can say during the current election campaign. But Governor Andrew Bailey said in May that the Bank may end up cutting rates further than markets were pricing at the time, a rare signal aimed at investors. Watch out for any speeches getting put into the calendar just after the UK election on 4 July, where officials like Bailey or his deputy governors/chief economist might look to firm up expectations for a summer cut. Away from the Bank of England, shares in Ocado have dived over 10% after the company said that its Canadian supermarket partner Sobeys had paused plans to expand its online shopping business with the British firm. Only a few weeks after being dumped from the FTSE 100, Ocado told the City that Empire Company Limited, owner of Sobeys, is pausing plans to open its fourth online shopping warehouse. The warehouse, powered by Ocado technology, was set to open in Vancouver next year. The two companies are also ending a deal under which they promised to exclusively work with each other on online shopping in Canada. Sobeys currently has three live warehouses using Ocado technology in Toronto, Montreal and Calgary which also supports the retailer serving online customers from almost 100 stores. Ocado said the two companies “have decided for now to focus their joint resources into driving order and sales volumes across the current network.” Ocado said its expectations for full year sales and profit this year remained unchanged however the latest delay comes amid growing uncertainty over Ocado’s growth potential. However, the pause with Sobeys is the latest blow to confidence in the company which has reined in expansion plans in the UK as it tries to improve profitability and already seen delays to key projects including a delivery centre for Coles in Australia. UK government borrowing costs are also dropping, as traders anticipate a cut in interest rates is coming soon. The yield (or rate of return) on two-year government bonds has fallen, as the price of the debt has risen. That shows that investors are prepared to accept a lower interest rate for holding UK debt – indicating they expect rate cuts soon. Sterling is weakening on the foreign exchange markets, as traders anticipate that the Bank of England may cut interest rates in August. The revelation that today’s decision to hold rates was “finely balanced” has knocked the pound, which has lost a third of a cent to $1.268 against the US dollar. The market reaction has been “swift”, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, as the City has taken today’s news as “a step in the direction of a rate cut at the next BOE meeting”. The money markets now suggest there’s a 45% chance of a rate cut in August, versus a 55% chance of no change (this pricing is changing, though!). Brooks explains: To sum up, the BOE’s statement and minutes have kept ajar the door for an August rate cut, as they have acknowledged the progress made on inflation to reach the 2% target. Although they remain committed to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target rate, they did give some decent excuses for the elevated levels of service price inflation, including prices that are set annually and other indicators that suggest wage growth could ease in the coming months. The market is taking this as a dovish sign, and are increasing their bets for an August rate cut. Interestingly, the Bank of England is trying to play down yesterday’s stronger-than-expected service sector inflation rate. The minutes of this month’s meeting point out that some components in the services inflation basket only change once a year (so aren’t a good measure of wider inflationary pressures). The Bank says: Services consumer price inflation had been 5.7% in May, down from 6.0% in March, but somewhat higher than had been projected in the May Report. This strength had in part reflected prices that were index-linked or regulated, which were typically changed only annually, and volatile components. The Bank of England has held interest rates at 5.25%, marking the seventh consecutive time the central bank has left the cost of borrowing unchanged. Dashing Rishi Sunak’s hopes of a pre-election cut in the cost of borrowing, a majority of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) said they wanted to see further evidence that prices growth would remain subdued. Financial markets expected the decision, despite a fall in inflation in May to the Bank’s 2% target. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said: “It’s good news that inflation has returned to our 2% target. We need to be sure that inflation will stay low and that’s why we’ve decided to hold rates at 5.25% for now.” More here: Bloomberg’s Lizzy Burden says the August interest rate meeting is ‘live’, after the Bank revealed that today’s decision was finely balanced for some. Reaction to today’s interest rate decision is pouring in. Dean Turner, chief eurozone and uk economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, says the first interest rate cut is drawing closer… “Today’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged was widely expected form the Bank of England, but the timing of the first easing is drawing closer. Notwithstanding some ongoing strength in service sector inflation data, as confirmed in yesterday’s release, the broader message is that inflation pressures are fading in the UK – a trend that was acknowledged by policymakers. To avoid a passive tightening in monetary policy, the Bank will soon have to lower interest rates to keep up with inflation on the way down, as it did on the way up. The Swiss National Bank’s decision to lower interest rates for a second time this morning (see here) is illustrative of this broader trend, we expect the BoE to join the cutting cycle when they meet in August.” Thomas Pugh, economist at leading audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, reckons the Bank will take the plunge in August, and cut interest rates. He says: ‘Today’s meeting was essentially a rinse and repeat from May. No change in rates, votes or forward guidance. All the focus is now on August and we think the MPC should cut rates at the next meeting. Whether it will or not depends on the next wage and inflation, particularly services, data showing signs of slowing. Indeed, the fact that for some members who voted to keep rates on hold “the policy decision at this meeting was finely balanced” suggests that it wouldn’t take much of a slowdown in wage growth or services inflation to convince them to vote for a rate cut in August. “It should come as no surprise that the MPC left interest rates at 5.25% today. A string of hotter-than-expected wage and services inflation data had already significantly reduced the chance of a rate cut and the calling of the election for just two weeks’ time was the final nail in the rate cut coffin. “Admittedly, the MPC is politically independent, so the timing of the election shouldn’t make a difference. But it will have been loath to introduce volatility into financial markets ahead of the election and with financial markets pricing in just a 2.5% chance of a rate cut today, a change would have spooked markets. What’s more, given the blackout in comms around the election any change in guidance would have to meet a higher bar. “The focus will now turn to the meeting on 1 August, where we think the BoE should follow the ECB, BoC and SNB and start cutting rates. Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group, says today’s statement from the BoE is ‘more dovish’ than expected, which could mean interest rates will be cut sooner, or faster, than expected: Naturally, the statement has put a heavy emphasis on the services inflation and labour market data over the coming months. Overall, the key takeaway is that the recent upside surprises in the services component is being interpreted as a blip due to one-off factors. This aligns with our call that a clearer downward trajectory should emerge over the summer, and that makes a first cut in August or September likely, conditional on the data cooperating in the meantime. Policymakers will likely be glad of the excuse not to rock the boat with a rate cut ahead of the July election, although Rishi Sunak would have enjoyed the rhetorical boost to his party’s economic campaigning. The statement is overall more dovish than expected, however, and the now higher market-implied prospects of incoming rate cuts will be constructive for mortgage holders. But….Suren Thiru, ICAEW economics director, says an August cut is ‘far from certain’: “With inflation back at target, the decision to keep interest rates on hold will provide obvious disappointment to those household and business borrowers struggling under the strain of the cumulative impact of 14 rate hikes. “While the minutes struck a slightly more dovish tone, the lack of movement in the vote split towards loosening policy means an August interest rate cut is far from certain. “Given that the UK has moved onto a milder inflationary trajectory, rate setters remain too circumspect over the likelihood of loosening policy, risking unnecessarily impeding the UK’s growth prospects. “With loosening labour market conditions likely to help ease concerns over underlying price pressures, the case for an August interest rate cut remains strong.” The Bank of England adds that it will “keep under review” how long to keep interest rates at their current level of 5.25%. It points out that the next decision, at the start of August, will be accompanied by new Bank forecasts for inflation. It says: The MPC [Monetary Policy Committee] remained prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It would therefore continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. As part of the August forecast round, members of the Committee would consider all of the information available and how this affected the assessment that the risks from inflation persistence were receding. On that basis, the Committee would keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level. The Bank of England has raised its growth forecast for the UK in the second quarter of this year. The Bank’s staff now expect GDP growth of 0.5% in the second quarter of 2024, stronger than the 0.2% rate predicted in May. That could cheer Rishi Sunak, who has been claiming for weeks that the economy has turned the corner, cushioning the disappointment that interest rates weren’t cut today. The upgrade comes after April’s GDP was stronger than the Bank expected, even though the economy didn’t actually grow that month. The Bank says: UK GDP appears to have grown more strongly than expected during the first half of this year. Business surveys, however, remain consistent with a slower pace of underlying growth, of around ¼% per quarter. Intriguingly, there appears to be a split among the seven Bank of England policymakers who voted to leave interest rates on hold today. The minutes of this month’s meeting show that some of these seven members were “finely balanced” between voting for a hold, or a cut. That means the decision not to cut interest rates today was a “close run thing”, reports the BBC’s Faisal Islam. The Bank’s minutes explain that there was “a range of views” among the seven members who voted to hold rates today (outvoting the two who wanted a cut). For some members within this group, the return of headline inflation to 2%, while welcome, was not necessarily indicative of the required sustained return to target. Continued high levels of, and upside news to, services inflation supported the view that second-round effects would maintain persistent upward pressure on underlying inflation. Wage growth had continued to exceed model-based estimates. Indicators of domestic demand were stronger than had been expected, and the risks to the outlook for activity were skewed to the upside. For these members, more evidence of diminishing inflation persistence was needed before reducing the degree of monetary policy restrictiveness. For other members within this group, the upside news in services price inflation relative to the May Report did not alter significantly the disinflationary trajectory that the economy was on. This view was supported by evidence that the recent strength in services inflation included regulated and indexed components of the basket, and volatile components. The impact of the increase in the NLW [National Living Wage]. this April on aggregate pay growth was unlikely to be as large in future. Such factors would not push up medium-term inflation. For these members, the policy decision at this meeting was finely balanced. The Bank of England warns that it expects the UK’s inflation rate to rise through this year. That’s because the falls in energy prices in the second half of 2023 will fall out of the inflation data. In the minutes of today’s meeting, it says: Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 2.0% in May from 3.2% in March, close to the May Monetary Policy Report projection. Indicators of short-term inflation expectations have also continued to moderate, particularly for households. CPI inflation is expected to rise slightly in the second half of this year, as declines in energy prices last year fall out of the annual comparison. Once again, the Bank of England’s policymakers were split over today’s interest rate decision. Two policymakers – Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden – again voted to cut rates to 5%. But they were outvoted by the rest of the committee (see earlier post for the breakdown of the MPC) who voted to leave rates at 5.25%. Newsflash: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates on hold, despite inflation falling to its target yesterday. The Bank’s monetary policy committee has voted to maintain base rate at 5.25%, a 16-year high. Policymakers were not swayed by May’s inflation data, which showing price rises slowed to its 2% target last month. This is the seventh time in a row that the BoE has left the cost of borrowing unchanged, since it raised rates to 5.25% last August, to fight inflation. The pound is holding steady against the US dollar as we await the Bank of England decision at noon, at just over $1.27. Today’s UK interest rate decision will be taken by the nine members of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee – made up of five senior Bank staff, and four external experts. They can be neatly divided into hawks (who favour tighter monetary policy) and doves (who would like borrowing costs to be lower). The most dovish member is economics professor Swati Dhingra, who voted for interest rate cuts at the previous three meetings. Originally a lone voice, she was joined by deputy Bank governor Dave Ramsden last month. The most hawkish MPC members, arguably, are the other three external members - Catherine Mann, Jonathan Haskel and Megan Greene. They all voted to raise interest rates even higher last year (but were outvoted). The other four – governor Andrew Bailey, deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Sarah Breeden, and chief economist Huw Pill, are gathered in the middle. Tension is building in the City of London, with less than an hour to wait until the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision. The money markets are indicating that the BoE will leave rates on hold – ‘no change’ is now a 99.9% possibility, according to the very latest market pricing. Achilleas Georgolopoulos, investment analyst, says: With the general elections just two weeks away, BoE members’ public appearances have been kept to a minimum lately to avoid criticism of intervening in the elections. Consequently, both the monetary policy statement and the voting pattern – 2 members voted for a rate cut in May – are unlikely to show major changes. Additionally, the BoE is probably lucky enough that a press conference has not been scheduled for today. Despite this lack of public communication, the BoE has not gone into hibernation and is preparing for the key August 1 gathering. The meeting will include both the quarterly projections and a press conference to explain any likely rate change or prepare the ground for a move in September. Interestingly, most market economists appear convinced that a 25bps rate cut will be announced in August. Just in: Britain’s tax gap – the amount of tax that should have been paid, but wasn’t – has swelled again. New data from HMRC shows that the tax gap rose to £39.8bn in the 2022-23 financial year, up from £38.1bn in 2021-22. The percentage tax gap fell, to 4.8% from 5.2%. The HMRC estimates that the tax gap in corporation tax paid by small businesses was over 32%, with almost £11bn of revenues lost. The total corporation tax gap was 13.9%, or £13.7bn. HRMC says: the tax gap for VAT reduced from 13.7% in 2005 to 2006 to 4.9% in 2022 to 2023 the tax gap for Income Tax, National Insurance contributions (NICs) and Capital Gains Tax gap reduced from 4.5% in 2005 to 2006 to 3.0% in 2022 to 2023 the tax gap for Corporation Tax increased from 11.4% in 2005 to 2006 to 13.9% in 2022 to 2023 the tax gap for excise duties reduced from 8.3% in 2005 to 2006 to 4.7% in 2022 to 2023 Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged to tackle tax avoidance if they win the next election, to fund spending commitments. The Bank of England is likely to exercise caution ahead of the general election on 4 July, suggests Laura Suter, director of personal finance at AJ Bell: “It’s highly likely the Bank will want to wait to see the outcome of the election and the final economic plans before making that first cut. “With no meeting in July, that means all eyes are now firmly on the August MPC meeting for our first potential cut to rates.” None of the 65 economists in a Reuters poll last week said they expected the BoE to cut interest rates today. So it would be a shock if the BoE chose to lower Bank rate to 5% at midday. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, says pacy service sector inflation will worry the Bank: Looking ahead, the Bank of England provide the main event of note for European traders, with the MPC having to weigh up just how long they wish to hold off before pulling the trigger. With inflation back down to the 2% target, the justification for keeping rates at a restrictive sixteen-year high of 5.25% will be questioned by many. Nonetheless, the fact that UK services inflation remains at a lofty 5.7% will not be lost on BoE members, with core inflation remaining well above target at 3.5%. Despite yesterday’s drop down to 2% for UK inflation, markets have in fact largely written off a rate cut today, instead looking for the first move to come in September. The Bank of England may not be convinced that inflation will stick sustainably at its 2% target this year, explains Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors: The Bank of England is highly likely to keep rates unchanged at today’s MPC meeting, in response to two sets of inflation prints that have been published since the previous meeting, both of which showed month-on-month inflation figures which remain much higher than needed for inflation to remain at 2%. Similarly, with wages still growing in the region of 6%, as they play catch up with a rising price level, services inflation is going to be slow to come down from its current level of 5.7%, feeding through to a core inflation rate of 3.5%, again well above the target level. Ultimately, in a mildly improving economic environment with consumer confidence now picking up from low levels, the central scenario looks likely to be that inflation drifts higher through the remainder of the year. With the Bank of England having previously emphasised the requirement for inflation to return to 2% sustainably, the evidence is not yet there that it has done that, and may not be for some months yet. That makes the likelihood of a rate cut this summer increasingly low, something already recognised by the market which prices in the first rate cut only by November. Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services says the Bank of England is ‘severely constrained’ by the election campaign: The MPC meeting is severely constrained by the general election campaign, per se the vote is likely to remain 7-2 in favour of holding rates at 5.25%, and the statement likely little changed, with particular emphasis placed on incoming data in terms of the rates outlook. The MPC may well be quite relieved that it is constrained at this meeting, with the run of recent data proving rather mixed in terms of the inflation, wage and growth outlooks. There will be particular attention given to the minutes, given that the BoE has been on ‘radio silence’ since the election was called. Back in early May, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey indicated that a rate cut could come today, telling reporters that “a change in bank rate in June is neither ruled out nor a fait accompli.” But investors lost confidence in a June rate cut on 22 May, when service sector inflation was clocked higher than expected, and Rishi Sunak called the general election. The Bank of England has been keeping quiet since the campaign began, to avoid the appearance of political interference, which has made it harder for economists to gauge the Bank’s thinking. Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, fears the Bank may delay cutting interest rates for too long, saying: Why not cut now? Wage growth is still strong at around 6%, services inflation at 5.7% - there are reasons to be cautious. But the labour market is softening - unemployment unexpectedly jumped to a two-year high 4.4%, the biggest monthly jump since the GFC, outside of the Covid era. And there is an election coming. I think the BoE could surprise with a cut today, but an election two weeks away means this is not likely. What it should do and what it will likely do are not necessarily the same thing. My worry is that the BoE stays too high for too long because it is looking at the lagging wage data rather than the weakening labour market. I fail to see any reason for the Bank to be holding off any longer – time to take a leaf out of the ECB playbook and trim some of the restriction. Short-term UK mortgage rates have dipped slightly today. Data provided Moneyfacts reports that the average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate has dropped to 5.96%, down from 5.97% yesterday. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is unchanged, at 5.53%. Yesterday NatWest announced it was cutting its fixed-rate deals today, by up to 0.17 percentage points. The Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates in August, rather than today, predicts Barret Kupelian, chief economist at PwC: “With headline inflation hitting its target rate, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee is nudging closer to cut its policy rate. The tide is clearly turning, but we still feel that the Bank is not quite there yet. Services inflation continues to remain significantly above its own projections (5.7% vs 5.3%), in part due to a tight labour market and also because of erratic factors. “The Bank is therefore likely to keep interest rates unchanged today. “The Monetary Policy Committee will next meet in August, armed with a new set of forecasts and an additional inflation reading, which will help clarify its thinking on how to proceed. Assuming no surprises, we think the Bank will cut rates in August.” More central bank action in Norway… but this time, there’s no change. Norges Bank has decided to leave its policy rate unchanged at 4.5%, citing concerns about inflation. Norges Bank says high interest rates have cooled the economy, slowing growth and inflation, but prices are still rising faster than its target. It adds: Based on the Committee’s current assessment of the outlook and balance of risks, the policy rate will likely be kept at that level for some time ahead. Newsflash: Interest rates have been cut….. in Switzerland. The Swiss National Bank has decided to cut its key interest rates from 1.5% to 1.25%, at its monetary policy meeting today. The SNB says that underlying inflationary pressures have decreased, meaning it can maintain appropriate monetary conditions with lower interest rates. It explains: Inflation has risen slightly since the last monetary policy assessment, and stood at 1.4% in May. Higher inflation in rents, tourism services and oil products has contributed in particular to this increase. Overall, inflation in Switzerland is currently being driven above all by higher prices for domestic services. The decision has knocked the Swiss franc: This is the second rate cut by the SNB this year; in March it became the first major central bank to lower borrowing costs in the current cycle. Ouch! Shares in polling company YouGov have plunged by a third in early trading, after it shocked investors with a profits warning. YouGov told the City this morning that sales bookings have been lower than anticipated, since it reported its half-year results (for the six months to 31 January) in March. Growth in the second half of its financial year has been “below expectations”, despite an investment push that was meant to drive activity. YouGov says: We continue to see increased demand for our customised research solutions, however, sales in our Data Products division have remained slow and we continue to see declines in fast-turnaround research services. Geographically we have seen challenges in EMEA, particularly in the DACH region. [The DACH region, in case you were wondering, is Germany, Austria and Switzerland, while EMEA covers, Europe, the Middle East and Africa]. YouGov now expects full-year adjusted operating profits of £41-44m, down from over £48m in 2023. Elsewhere in the financial sector, Sainsbury’s has sold its banking arm to NatWest. The deal will give NatWest around one million customer accounts, along with £2.5bn of customer assets (including loans and credt card balances) and £2.6bn of customer deposits. I say “sold”… but Sainsbury’s Bank are also paying NatWest £125m as part of the deal… Paul Thwaite, NatWest Group CEO, says: This transaction is a great opportunity to accelerate the growth of our Retail Banking business at attractive returns, in line with our strategic priorities. As well as a complementary customer base, the transaction is expected to add scale to our credit card and unsecured personal lending business within existing risk appetite. Sainsbury’s told the City it expects Sainsbury’s Bank to return it excess capital of at least £250m, which will be redistributed to its shareholders. Shares in Sainsbury’s have jumped 1.6% in early trading. It would be a major shock if the Bank of England changed interest rates today. The money markets currently indicate that ‘no change’ is a 99% chance. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz, and president of Queens’ College, Cambridge, suspects the Bank of England may be cautious about signalling future interest rate cuts today. Currently, the money markets expect the first rate cut to come by November, with a second priced in by February 2025. The Bank of England decision isn’t the only important event on the calendar today, of course… As professor Andrew Angus of Cranfield School of Management, reminds us: “While England football fans will be hoping for a good result on Thursday evening, the Bank of England won’t want to score any own goals earlier in the day. Expect the monetary policy committee to err on the side of caution, keeping interest rates unchanged. While a good performance from England and Scotland in the Euros could energise the economy, many households are still reeling from stubborn inflationary pressures, meaning interest rates are now unlikely to fall until late summer.” Dutch bank ING predict the first UK interest rate cut will come in August, with a total of three cuts this year. But having said that, ING’s developed markets economist, James Smith, suggests the markets may be underpricing the chances of a rate cut today. He explains: Investors reckon the Bank is highly unlikely to cut interest rates in an election campaign. We wouldn’t be so sure of that. We don’t expect a rate cut, but markets are under-pricing the chances. The good news for the Bank is that the issue of rate cuts has avoided becoming politicised in a way that it might do in the US presidential election campaign later this year, even if other areas of BoE policy (related to reserve remuneration) are coming under scrutiny. Our takeaway from the last meeting in May was that June’s decision would be on a knife-edge, and that calculation probably hasn’t changed as much as markets might think. Governor Andrew Bailey, we felt, sounded like he would have voted for a rate cut in May had his committee been more on board with it. Still, our base case is a pause this month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Rishi Sunak’s hopes of a pre-election interest rate cut are likely to be dashed today, in one of the most politically sensitive monetary policy decisions in years. The Bank of England will set interest rates at noon, and is widely expected to leave them on hold at 5.25%, a 16-year high. Yesterday’s fall in inflation, back to the BoE’s 2% target, gives its monetary policy committee (MPC) a good reason to consider cutting rates, to take some of the pressure off borrowers. However, policymakers will have noted, glumly, that inflation in the services sector is running much hotter, with prices up 5.7% in the last 12 months. Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, says: While calls for an imminent rate cut will grow, given headline CPI’s descent to 2%, there’s likely to be growing concerns around the stickiness surrounding services inflation. There may not be unanimity about today’s decision. At the last meeting, in May, two MPC members voted to cut rates, but were out numbered by their seven colleagues who voted for no change. City economists expect another 7-2 split today, with Swati Dhinga and deputy governor Dave Ramsden expected to again push for a rate cut. The minutes of this week’s meeting will also be published at midday, giving an insight into the Bank’s views about the health of the economy, and the prospects for growth and inflation. Conservatives may be disappointed if the Bank leaves rates on hold again today, as some – such as former Cabinet minister Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg – have been calling for rate cuts this year. An interest rate cut would, arguably, bolster Sunak’s claims that the economy has turned the corner. But the Bank is likely to be concerned that inflationary pressures could still be lurking in the economy. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: First, services inflation remains high – perhaps too high near 6% - to let the BoE cut rates with a peace of mind as services make up around 80% of the British economy. And second, consumer prices could rapidly rebound if natural gas market tightens as traders rush to replenish their stockpiles before winter. As such, if the BoE doesn’t announce a rate cut today, it’s not because they don’t want to put their nose into the country’s political affairs with the upcoming general election, but it’s mostly because the underlying inflationary factors are not yet convincing enough to allow them to do so.

        "title": "Families of Boeing crash victims demand prosecution for ‘deadliest corporate crime in US history’",
        "content": "Families of the victims of two Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia have demanded that the plane maker be criminally prosecuted and fined $25bn for “the deadliest corporate crime in US history”. In a letter to the US justice department, Paul Cassell, an attorney for 15 victims’ families, said that the amount is “legally justified and clearly appropriate”, but could be significantly reduced if Boeing improved safety standards and agreed to an independent monitor. The letter comes after Boeing’s CEO, Dave Calhoun, stood and apologized to the families of the twin accidents’ 346 victims, saying everyone at Boeing was “‘deeply sorry for your losses”, at a Senate hearing in Washington DC. Senators called on the company to fix its “broken safety culture”. The air crashes involving the 737 Max came in 2018, when a Lion Air jet crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 189 people on board, and in early 2019 when an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed near Addis Ababa, killing 157. Both crashes were blamed on a faulty anti-stall system that the pilots of the planes had not been instructed on how to operate and had pushed the aircraft into fatal dives. Boeing and the justice department did not immediately respond to the petition. The Seattle plane maker is under mounting pressure over manufacturing failures. A door blew off a 737 Max in mid-flight in January, prompting federal prosecutors to consider reversing an expiring non-prosecution agreement over the 737 Max crashes. Justice department officials have told victims’ families that individual prosecutions are unlikely given a five year statute of limitations. In April, Boeing told the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) about potentially falsified inspection records related to the wings of 787 Dreamliner planes and it would need to reinspect some of the model still in production. Prosecutors now have until 7 July to decide what penalties Boeing should face. At the Capitol Hill hearings this week, Democrat Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal said “the evidence is near-overwhelming to justify” Boeing’s prosecution. The shares in the company are down by one-third this year and the company has warned that it is likely to burn through $8bn in cash in the first half of the year. Calhoun is stepping down, marking the second CEO to do so since the twin crashes. Trust in aviation safety has been further undermined by recent reports that counterfeit titanium from a little-known Chinese company was used in parts purchased by both Boeing and European rival Airbus. Fake documentation certifying the material’s authenticity is being investigated by the FAA and Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for Boeing and wings for Airbus. The FAA said in a statement that it is investigating the scope of the problem after Boeing reported the “procurement of material through a distributor who may have falsified or provided incorrect records”. Among the families of passengers killed in Indonesian and Ethiopian 737 Max crashes was Zipporah Kuria, whose father was killed in the second incident. Kuria told the BBC the families would “continue to press the US government to hold Boeing and its corporate executives criminally responsible for the deaths of 346 people. We will not rest until we see justice.”",

        "title": "DS Smith’s £5.8bn takeover by US rival going ahead despite competition",
        "content": "The boss of the FTSE 100 company DS Smith has said its £5.8bn takeover by a US rival is going at “absolutely full steam”, despite concerns it could be derailed by another packaging sector merger. Miles Roberts, DS Smith’s chief executive, said merger work with International Paper was “going very well” and that he definitely expected the deal to complete. DS Smith makes the cardboard boxes used by retailers such as Amazon and Unilever, the owner of brands such as Marmite and Dove Soap. The company may not operate the most glamorous business, but since the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic settled there has been a wave of interest in takeovers within the industry as companies attempt to dominate globally. DS Smith agreed to be taken over by Tennessee-based International Paper for £5.8bn in April, gatecrashing a £5.1bn agreement with FTSE 100 rival Mondi. However, in May it emerged that International Paper, which is valued at $16bn, was a possible target for Brazil’s Suzano, controlled by the billionaire Feffer family. It is widely expected that the DS Smith takeover would be dropped if Suzano completed the acquisition. Suzanosaid in a filing to Brazilian regulators last month that it had not reached a binding deal with International Paper, and it has made no statements since then. Roberts declined to comment on whether he had discussed a possible Suzano bid with International Paper, citing takeover rules. If the takeover does go ahead, DS Smith would be the latest in a series of big British companies to disappear from the FTSE 100 index. Roberts said “on a personal basis” he rued the departure of businesses from London, “but my personal view has nothing to do with it” because shareholders were clearly in favour. Roberts said there was a gap in valuations between UK and US businesses with similar qualities, which made it easier for American companies to bid for British rivals rather than the other way around. In the run-up to the UK general election, which polls indicate are likely to be won convincingly by Labour, Roberts said a new government needed to offer long-term certainty over the direction of its industrial policy – crucially on energy – to help to close the gap. “Where is the power to come from to power our factories?” he said. In the last year the packaging sector has struggled with inflation and slower consumer demand. On Thursday, DS Smith reported a steep 17% drop in revenues to £6.8bn in the year to the end of April. Annual profits also dropped, by 24% to £503m, in the year to the end of April, although that was slightly better than had been expected by analysts. Roberts said the company had seen a “noticeable improvement in consumer sentiment” in the second half of its financial year and in recent months.",

        "title": "NatWest to take on most of Sainsbury’s Bank",
        "content": "NatWest will take on most of Sainsbury’s banking business, in a deal that will add 1m customer accounts to the lender’s books in the latest wave of consolidation in the sector. The lender is to take on the bulk of Sainsbury’s Bank assets, including its outstanding credit card, unsecured personal loan and savings accounts. Sainsbury’s Bank had been up for sale since January, when the supermarket group announced it would exit its banking business after 27 years. NatWest will acquire £2.5bn of customer assets, including £1.4bn of unsecured personal loans and £1.1bn of credit card balances. It will also take on £2.6bn of liabilities, primarily made up of customer deposits. Unlike most takeovers, the seller is paying a significant sum to get the deal done: Sainsbury’s is on track to pay NatWest £125m to take the business off its hands, with the final price to be determined when the deal is completed in early 2025. The arrangement reflects the supermarket’s desire to quickly off-load its non-core businesses and focus primarily on food, and the fact that NatWest will be taking on more liabilities than assets as part of the deal. It also indicates a much wider issue, with UK banks having long been valued much lower than the assets on their balance sheets. Some Tory ministers have blamed this on lingering concerns over the impact of Brexit, as well as a perception that banks face a hostile political environment in the UK. Those concerns were amplified when the Conservative government pushed NatWest’s chief executive, Alison Rose, to resign last year after a row with Nigel Farage, now the leader of Reform UK. However, investors broadly welcomed the terms of the Sainsbury’s Bank deal. The supermarket’s shares rose as much as 2.5% after the deal was announced on Thursday, while NatWest was up 1.7%. “It’s no surprise the market has given the thumbs up to Sainsbury’s disposal,” the AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said. “The supermarket has been on a roll over the past few years with its strategy of focusing primarily on food, and removing any distractions elsewhere in the business could help to oil the wheels.” Clive Black, the head of consumer research at Shore Capital, said the deal was “another good move” by the Sainsbury’s chief executive, Simon Roberts. “All in all, we welcome the announcement that Sainsbury has disposed of its core banking business, and at a pace that is faster than we originally anticipated … drawing to a close an adventure that had lofty ambitions to be a challenger bank that was thwarted by regulators, technocrats and the power of incumbents.” Sainsbury’s acted after a strategic review concluded the banking operations could distract from bringing its focus back to its core grocery and retail operations. It first considered selling the bank during the Covid pandemic and NatWest had been suggested as a potential bidder. Paul Thwaite, the new chief executive of NatWest, has indicated he will consider acquisitions if they add scale to the business. The latest deal will boost its credit cards business, which NatWest has identified as a potential area for growth. The NatWest deal does not include certain assets, such as the commission income business of Sainsbury’s Bank or ATMs, insurance and travel money or Argos Financial Services. It is conditional on certain approvals including by regulators. Thwaite said: “This transaction is a great opportunity to accelerate the growth of our retail banking business at attractive returns, in line with our strategic priorities.” The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidation among smaller lenders at a time when bank profitability has been bolstered by higher interest rates. This has meant banks’ net interest income has risen as the amount of money they claw in from higher borrowing costs outpaces the sum they pay in interest on deposits. In recent months, larger lenders have been snapping up smaller rivals. Last month, Coventry building society announced it would buy Co-operative Bank from its hedge-fund owners for £780m to create a mutual with almost 5 million customers and an £89bn balance sheet. In March, Nationwide, the world’s largest building society, launched a £2.9bn takeover of Virgin Money. Barclays also agreed to buy most of Tesco Bank for £700m in February from the UK’s largest supermarket chain, which retained some assets, including its insurance and travel money operations.",

        "title": "Policing minister’s wife in legal row over corporate espionage claims",
        "content": "A leading businesswoman who is married to the policing minister, Chris Philp is being sued in the high court over allegations of corporate espionage. Elizabeth Philp, 40, whose husband has called for “zero tolerance” to all crime, is accused of using confidential information from her former employer to set up a rival business. She denies the allegations and is countersuing her former employer, whom she accuses of cyber-attacking the website of the company she subsequently founded. The legal tussle centres on the departure of Philp from the London Specialist Pharmacy Group (LSPG), where she was chief executive until 2017, and the founding of her own company, Roseway Labs. Her former employer has accused her of having stored and retained “trade secrets” on a Dell XPS laptop computer that was not wiped before she left the company. It is further claimed that, along with two other former London Specialist Pharmacy employees, Philp conspired to poach her former employer’s client lists for their new firm, leading to losses of approximately £1.5m. In Philp’s defence and counterclaim, she denies the allegations and claims that a delay in carrying out a factory reset of her laptop was the result of being “fully involved in supporting her husband’s campaign as part of the 8 June 2017 general election”. “To the best of her recollection, [Elizabeth Philp] did not access the laptop at any time following her cessation of work for the claimants prior to the performance of the factory reset,” the defence says. It is understood that Philp has obtained an expert report stating “that the device had undergone a factory reset upon, by the latest, the date of 12/06/2017” and that “there was no information presented to suggest that the device had retained any data created prior to the date of 12/06/2017”. The LSPG has also detailed a number of occasions when Philp’s alleged co-conspirators are said to have downloaded confidential information or sent it to personal email addresses. In response, it is claimed that the information was not confidential and had been sent as part of the normal course of work. The General Pharmaceutical Council rejected a complaint last October relating to one of the employees. The claimants, Gluck Health Limited and its subsidiary, the London Specialist Pharmacy, are seeking the return of a £10,000 termination payment given to Philp along with hundreds of thousands of pounds in damages. Philp now describes herself as the co-founder and chief executive of Roseway Labs, a pharmacy that was founded in 2018 to work with private doctors to offer personalised medicine. The company provides medications for health issues such as hair loss, skin problems and hormone imbalances, a sector in which the LSPG claimed it had a “near monopoly” before Roseway was founded. The legal action is the latest twist in a bitter rivalry between Dr Marion Gluck, 74, who founded Gluck Health Limited, and Philp’s company. Gluck, who is regarded as a pioneer in the treatment of hormonal imbalances, was suspended from medical practice for four months in September after she was found to have accessed restricted parts of Roseway’s website after borrowing the log-in details. The data breach was discovered and reported by Philp in 2022. Gluck had denied personally accessing the details, but she accepted that she “facilitated” the use of the login address for her staff, claiming it was to study the format of Roseway’s website. Lawyers for Roseway are now seeking damages. Philp said: “Roseway Labs was the victim of a deliberate and sustained cyber-attack by the Specialist Pharmacy, which only raised allegations against Roseway Labs once it was clear that their activities had been discovered. “This was four years after Roseway Labs had started trading. Nothing of substance has been raised. Roseway Labs reported the attack to the Information Commissioner’s Office, which suggested that we report it to the police under the Computer Misuse Act. “We chose not to do so at that time and, instead, reported it to the relevant regulators. At no point has Roseway Labs received any contact from the police or the Crown Prosecution Service and [Roseway Labs] has not committed any offence.” Philp’s husband is standing to be re-elected as the MP for Croydon South. This February, he called for a significant increase in the number of arrests, arguing that there was no such thing as a minor crime. “I want to see zero tolerance towards all crime from the police and a back-to-basics approach that significantly increases the number of criminals caught and prosecuted,” he said.

        "title": "Households are hurting. Savings are weak. The future’s uncertain. Is a rate cut near? | Greg Jericho",
        "content": "The Reserve Bank’s decision to keep rates steady reinforced that the economy at this moment remains one with both good and bad signs, and the RBA governor, Michele Bullock, is refreshingly upfront about the difficulties. Unsurprisingly, the RBA’s call to keep rates unchanged was met by some in the media and conservative commentariat as a failure to be tough. Some would prefer the RBA to be less concerned about the risk of a recession or rising unemployment than getting inflation from 3.6% to below 3%. Such views are much easier to make when your own job is safe and your income is very comfortable. It is worth remembering that in the past two years the share of household income spent on mortgage repayments has risen by the amount it did in five years during the mining boom, and by more than occurred in the run-up to the 1990s recession: If the graph does not display click here And while we’re not quite spending as great of a share of our income on repayments as we were in 2008, the cost of an average dwelling is now equivalent to 16.6 years’ worth of the average household disposable income, compared to 12.3 years then and 9.5 years in 1989 when the cost of servicing a loan peaked before the recession: If the graph does not display click here So those wanting more pain are really talking about a historical level of hurt, even though inflation has come down at the same pace it has in other nations with higher rates such as the US and Canada. Fortunately, Bullock is rather more careful than are those blithely dismissing concerns of a recession. In her press conference, and the RBA’s policy statement, Bullock noted that the “outlook remains highly uncertain”. One of the biggest reasons for this uncertainty is something that happened in the latest GDP figures. The RBA has been trying to work out why household spending was so bad. After all, unemployment was still around 4.0%, wage growth was at 4.1%, and finally real wages were rising. And yet household spending was utterly stuffed – growing a mere 0.1% over the year in 2023. Then, in the March GDP data, the Australia Bureau of Statistics revised the figures, in an attempt to get “seasonally adjusted” back to some sort of sense after the years of Covid insanity. And it now estimates that we spent more in 2023 than previously thought. Rather than just 0.1% annual growth last year, the ABS now estimates our spending increased by 1.0%. If the graph does not display click here Now that is still pathetic. As I noted earlier this month, most of the growth was on essential items. The figures in March were just bad rather than terrible. But the ABS also revised down how much we saved: If the graph does not display click here The household savings ratio in December was revised down from 3.2% to 1.6%. In dollar terms the changes look like this: If the graph does not display click here Household income was not revised by much, so all the changes were about what we were doing with our money – spending more and saving less, or in effect, saving less to spend more. The question is: what does this mean for inflation and interest rates? Bullock doesn’t seem to be sure. And she was upfront about this. She told the media gathering on Tuesday that you can think about these changes “in a couple of ways”. The first way is the glass half-full view. People, she suggested, are “saving less to support their consumption because they’re very confident about the future”. That is, we feel confident that our jobs are secure and that our wages will rise above inflation and so why save for a rainy day? Let’s go spend! The other way is more of a glass half-empty view. In this view she suggested the figures show that “people are really hurting and they’re not saving as much, and they’re really struggling to make ends meet, in which case that doesn’t bode so well for consumption”. If the glass half-full view is correct, then the coming stage-three tax cuts might add to the amount of spending in a manner that may cause inflation to rise. If the glass half-empty view is correct, then the stage-three tax cuts will lessen the struggle and have a negligible impact on inflation. For now, the market continues to believe that the next move is for a rate cut: If the graph does not display click here But the future here is uncertain and, while the media does like to suggest that uncertainty means a rate rise is more likely, the uncertainty also relates to the possible need for a rate cut. Bullock noted that the RBA is also focused on unemployment because “people having jobs is critical to them being able to meet the challenges of the higher cost of living”. She also said the bank still believes it is “on the narrow path” to getting inflation down while keeping unemployment low and Australia out of a recession. But crucially she added that the path “does appear to be getting a bit narrower”. This certainly is worrying, but it is good to know that the RBA is much more concerned about the great cost of people losing their jobs than are those who blithely suggest rates need to be raised with little to no regard for the risks of a recession or the loss of jobs that would bring. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work",

        "content": "The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said pressure on household finances remains “acute” despite official figures showing UK inflation fell to 2% in May, returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the consumer prices index (CPI) had eased in May, down from 2.3% in April, raising expectations of a cut in borrowing costs by the Bank of England. Lower prices growth will give encouragement to Rishi Sunak after the prime minister made bringing inflation under control one of his main aims.

Take care! – JK France has become one of seven European Union countries to be named and shamed over the size of its budget deficit in a move that could put Paris on a collision course with the European Commission. Brussels announced that it was opening disciplinary action against France, Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia for running excessive budget deficits that are above the EU limit of 3% of national income. Under the terms of the EU’s excessive deficit procedure, the seven countries identified will have to provide a plan of the corrective action they will take and the policies they will implement to bring their deficits below the 3% limit. The Commission will issue proposals on how fast the deficit should be cut in November, with 0.5% of GDP annual cuts as a benchmark. Euro-area countries that do not follow up on the recommendations would potentially face fines. Despite planned spending cuts, the International Monetary Fund estimates France’s deficit will fall gradually from the 5.5% of GDP reached in 2023, 5.3% of GDP this year and 4.5% of GDP by 2027. But opinion polls suggest Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) party – which plans to cut taxes and – is set for big gains in the looming parliamentary elections. Leo Barincou, senior economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said: The gradual fiscal consolidation planned by the current government will be the first casualty of the political crisis, worsening France’s already fraught public finances. A divided parliament is unlikely to be able to agree on politically difficult spending cuts, which would result in a higher deficit than our current baseline. Meanwhile, the implementation of the RN platform as it currently stands would add to the public deficit. Young &amp; Co’s Brewery has posted rising sales in recent weeks and was hopeful of higher summer sales thanks to the Euro football tournament, Wimbledon and the Olympics, followed by the autumn rugby internationals. The British pub group said total sales climbed 24% year-on-year in the nine weeks from 1 April, with like-for-like sales (at pubs open at least a year) up 2.4%. Pubs have struggled with high energy and wage costs and the lacklustre economic backdrop but are now looking forward to a summer of sport. Chief executive Simon Dodd said: Looking ahead, we face some challenges, but there is plenty for us to be excited about this year. NatWest has become the first major mortgage lender to cut its rates ahead of tomorrow’s Bank of England’s interest rate decision, where the central bank is widely expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged at 5.25%. However, a fall in inflation back to its 2% target has boosted hopes of a rate reduction at its next meeting in August. NatWest is lowering fixed-rate deals by as much 0.17 percentage points from tomorrow. its largest cuts are for people who are remortgaging and opting for a five-year fix, with the leading rate at 4.41%. Smaller lenders have also cut their rates this week, with the Co-operative Bank lowering the cost of mortgage loans by up to 0.22 percentage points and Nottingham Building Society reducing deals by 0.24 points. Farmers have warned that there could be shortages of British potatoes in the future due to extreme weather conditions and increased cost of production for farmers. The National Farmers Union (NFU) has now called on politicians to take action action and “Save our Spuds” after drought, floods and months of heavy rain this season, had led to significant delays in the harvesting and planting of potato crops. It also comes as potato farmers have seen the costs of production increase by 28% in the past two years. Alastair Heath, vice chair of the NFU’s potato policy group, said: A number of growers have made the difficult choice to reduce production to minimise losses, and the relentless wet weather has put many more growers weeks behind schedule. For some, profits have been all but wiped out. Business confidence is low and investment has become a far-away concept, which is putting pressure on British potato supplies in the short-term. While it’s unlikely to lead to empty shelves this year, this pressure on the homegrown crop is an indication that we need urgent action to prevent the situation getting worse. I believe we can and should be self-sufficient in potatoes. Just 13% of top roles at listed UK companies are held by women and less than 1% are held by women of colour, according to the annual Women on Boards report. At companies listed on the FTSE or AIM, only 13% of the top jobs – chief executive, chair, chief financial officer and senior independent director – are held by women (436 women across 3,452 roles), said the report by WB Directors. This includes just 25 women of colour, 0.7% of the total. At Britain’s biggest listed companies on the FTSE 100, the proportion of senior roles held by women of colour is 1.5%. This compares with 0.3% at the smaller businesses listed on AIM. This is despite the FTSE Women Leaders Review introducing a focus on these four roles and the Financial Conduct Authority going further to set a target for firms to have at least one woman in these positions. The FTSE 100 has 24% of women in the top four board roles – close to the target of one of the four. The FTSE 250 has 19.6% of women in the top four roles and the FTSE SmallCap fares slightly better at 21.7%. However, the two most senior roles of chair and CEO are those with the least female representation, at just 7.9% and 6.8% respectively across FTSE All-Share and AIM listings. More than a third (35%) of FTSE All-Share firms have not reached the target of having a board made up of 40% or more women, and this is worse for smaller companies listed on AIM, where 88% are falling short of the target. The number of AIM companies with all-male boards has shot up to more than a third (35%), from 18% last year (187 firms). Fiona Hathorn, chief executive of WB Directors, said: Targets and scrutiny have resulted in hard-fought gains at FTSE 350 level. However, it’s time to extend focus to the smaller listed companies and ensure that efforts to monitor board diversity are intersectional across gender and ethnicity. There is a persistent underrepresentation of women and especially women of colour in positions of power. We need firms across the FTSE SmallCap and AIM to urgently act on creating greater diversity at all levels. Measure it, report it, make it public - or the laggards will continue to simply opt out. Amazon workers in the UK have come a step closer to gaining union recognition for the first time as officials from the GMB arrive at the tech firm’s Coventry depot to kick off a month-long ballot process. Officials from the union are to visit the West Midlands site on Wednesday after the GMB was granted the right to hold the legally binding ballot by the independent Central Arbitration Committee. Amazon had rejected a request for voluntary recognition. If staff vote to support recognition, the GMB would be given the right to represent them in negotiations over pay and conditions, marking the first time Amazon has recognised a union in the UK. From today, more than 2,000 staff will be invited to a series of 45-minute meetings with union representatives – and separate gatherings with the company – at which the two sides will make their case. Voting will then take place in the workplace from 8 July, with the result announced after 15 July. Amanda Gearing, a senior GMB organiser, said: Amazon is one of the world’s most hostile and anti-union employers. They’re a multi-billion-pound global company investing huge energy to resist efforts by working-class people in Coventry to fight for a better life. But Coventry Amazon workers have rejected Amazon’s attempts to smash their union. Now Amazon workers, not the bosses, will decide. Progress towards a series of levelling up goals set by the UK government has been “glacial”, and achieving them by the target date of 2030 will require a big increase in resources for struggling areas, a leading thinktank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that, on many measures, regional inequality had widened and the UK had gone into reverse. In 2022, the government set out a white paper containing 12 goals aimed at “levelling up” the UK. While praising the clarity and ambition of the plan, the thinktank said the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost of living crisis had combined to make the period since the last election, in 2019, a challenging time to make good on the Conservative party’s pledge to narrow the UK’s geographic divisions. The white paper’s missions included goals for primary school attainment, public transport use, high-quality skills training and employment; however, the IFS report found that: The share of pupils in England meeting expected standards at the end of primary school dropped from 65% in 2018–19 to 60% in June 2023, against a target of 90% by 2030. In only 10 English local authorities – all in London – did at least 70% of 11-year-olds meet this target. The total number of further education and skills courses completed in England fell by 14% between 2018–19 and 2022–23. In the lowest skilled areas, the decline was almost 20%. The goal for 2030 is to have 200,000 more people successfully completing high-quality skills training annually, driven by 80,000 more people completing courses in the lowest skilled areas. A 21-percentage-point gap in the average employment rate between the best and worst-performing local authority areas in the UK – the widest it has been since at least 2005. The aim is to have rising pay, employment and productivity in every area of the UK, and a smaller gap between the top performing areas and others. The Conservatives’ aim is for local transport connectivity across England to be significantly closer to the standards of London, but the gap between the use of public transport in London (39% of journeys) and in the rest of the country (7%) during 2022-23 was at its second-widest level since 2002–03, as passenger numbers failed to recover to pre-pandemic levels. The media group which owns the Daily Telegraph newspaper tumbled into the red last year after it set aside nearly £280m to cover loans made to the Barclay family which may not be repaid. The group said that, despite a resilient financial performance, it had made losses of £244.6m in 2023 – against profits of £33.3m in the previous year – due to the provision. Telegraph Media Group accounts show that a £277.6m provision has been taken against amounts due from parent company undertakings “with the ongoing corporate transaction casting doubt over the recoverability of this balance”. The Telegraph on its own website reported that the provision had come as a result of “loans extracted by the Barclay family which are unlikely ever to be repaid”. The future ownership of the Telegraph titles and the Spectator magazine has been uncertain since June 2023, when the titles were seized by Lloyds bank after the Barclay family failed to repay £1.16bn in debts. The debts were later repaid by a UAE-backed consortium which had hoped to buy the group but were forced to walk away under political pressure. Today, the media company said in its 2023 accounts that a detailed review of historical transactions had been undertaken in relation to amounts paid to and received from group companies and related parties. It said this review had “identified potential irregularities in the recording of such transactions” and said that, although there had been no changes to assets and liabilities, there was “a potential risk of future possible repayment claims against the company and group in respect of such transactions”. The Telegraph’s 2023 losses came as the group reported it had surpassed 1m subscriptions in August 2023, with subscriptions across Telegraph Media Group increasing from 734,000 in December 2022 to 1.03m in December 2023. The largest contributor to the subscription boost came from the £13m acquisition last year of Chelsea Magazine Company, a publisher of consumer titles including Classic Boat. Turnover increased to £268m in 2023 against £254.2m in 2022, largely due to the growth in digital advertising and partnerships as well as digital subscriptions, it said. Sir George Iacobescu, the chair and former chief executive of Canary Wharf Group, today announced that after 36 years he would be retiring from the property developer. Replaced by former L&amp;G chief executive Sir Nigel Wilson, the move brings to a close to a near four-decade association with the company, and the financial centre in London’s Docklands that he was so instrumental in establishing. A powerhouse of the property world, like the Canary Wharf regeneration project he became so synonymous with, he came from nearly nothing, to become one of the most prominent figures in the property development landscape. Born in Romania in 1945, he grew up, like many Romanians at the time, with very little money under the the communist government that ruled the country at the time. So poor was the state of the finances of the country and its citizens, Iacobescu tells the story of his mother-in-law once being asked to bring her own lightbulb to a medical operation. This was the only bulb in her home, and meant her apartment was left in the dark for the day. Growing up, he initially wanted to be a doctor like his father but was pushed to engineering after his dad advised against it, telling him to get into construction because “the world will never stop building”. Taking his father’s words to heart, he studied civil engineering in Bucharest. After working as a structural engineer in the Romania between 1969 and 1975, he was able to leave the country for Canada after getting help from a relative in North America. While in Canada, he got a job with developer Olympia &amp; York (O&amp;Y) and was heavily involved in building Chicago’s Olympia Centre skyscraper and the vast World Financial Centre in New York. His relationship with what would become London’s key financial district began in 1987, when he was sent to London from Toronto by O&amp;Y founder Paul Reichmann to investigate whether it was feasible to build on the abandoned docklands site. Here’s a plea to Rachel Reeves, assuming she is the next chancellor: please give your new national wealth fund a different name, writes our financial editor Nils Pratley. The title is misleading because, whether intentionally or not, it conjures images of a Norway-style sovereign wealth fund – a vehicle to accumulate vast long-term riches for the benefit of today’s citizens and future generations. In reality, Labour’s national wealth fund will be nothing like a sovereign wealth fund, even if it is sometimes misreported as being one. It would be a fine thing if we had such a vehicle but, sadly, the time to launch one was circa 1990, as the far-sighted Norwegians did, when North Sea oil revenues were booming. With the benefit of regular capital injections, plus the wonder of compound returns over long investment horizons, the value of the Norwegian fund is now $1.6tn. That is equivalent to half the UK’s national debt. By contrast, the new national wealth fund will invest a mere £7.3bn over the course of the next parliament – and the cash will come from borrowing. And, unlike a sovereign wealth fund that invests around the globe to spread risk, Labour’s fund will concentrate on a narrow sector of the UK economy. The party’s manifesto details £1.8bn directed at ports, £1.5bn for gigafactories, £2.5bn to clean steel, £1bn for carbon capture and £500m to green hydrogen. Therein lies the real purpose: this is a state-backed vehicle to co-invest alongside private sector companies in order, it is hoped, to accelerate growth in areas related to the green economy. It will be able to take equity stakes, lend directly and underwrite loans. But the core part of the mission is to attract £3 of private investment for every £1 of public investment. That 3:1 ratio looks achievable because it is what the old “green investment bank” (also misnamed, because it wasn’t a bank) achieved before George Osborne, having set it up during the coalition years, shockingly sold it to Macquarie for £1.6bn in 2017. The national wealth fund will be bigger than the green bank but will be similarly aimed at hard-to-finance projects and should also have an arms-length investment manager to impose commercial discipline. Labour has challenged the Conservatives to match its commitment to strengthen the economic watchdog within the first 100 days of government. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has pledged to introduce legislation giving the Office for Budget Responsibility greater powers in Labour’s first king’s speech. Labour’s planned law would empower the OBR to independently publish a forecast of any major fiscal event making significant tax and spending changes. The changes are intended to prevent a repeat of Liz Truss’s catastrophic mini-budget, which was delivered without an OBR forecast, by preventing ministers from “gagging” the watchdog in future. Truss’s mini-budget included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts and caused a meltdown in the financial markets, including a collapse in the value of the pound. Reeves told the Guardian: Britain is still paying the price of Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget that crashed the economy, put pensions in peril and sent mortgage bills soaring. It’s clear from Jeremy Hunt’s comments that he has learnt absolutely nothing from that period and is instead pandering to the reckless voices in his party. Shares in the upmarket UK housebuilder Berkeley fell almost 4% this morning, making it the biggest loser on the FTSE 100 index, even though it raised its 2025 outlook. The company said it would plunge back into the private rental market for the first time in a decade by launching a build-to rent arm to tackle the “severe shortage” of properties in and around London. Berkeley, which built 3,500 homes for private sale last year, will establish a build-to-rent business, which aims to create 4,000 homes in London and the south-east over the next decade. Berkeley plans to develop the properties across 17 brownfield sites and launch a dedicated online platform to manage them. The firm reported a pre-tax profit of £557m for the year to 30 April, down from £604m last year. However, it has increased its pre-tax profit guidance for 2025 by 5% to £525m. Anthony Codling of RBC Capital Markets said: Not content with firing on all cylinders, Berkeley announced today that it is adding another cylinder to its finely tuned engine, a build to rent platform, it has also increased its FY2025 guidance by 5% to £525m - bold actions in uncertain times. The Build to Rent platform is not a response pointing a weakness in the sales market, rather it points to the significant potential in the private rental market. Whether looking at homes for sale or homes for rent, we have a supply shortage and Berkeley is doing its bit to supply the homes we need. Factory gate price inflation in the UK picked up in May, separate figures from the ONS showed. Factory gate costs – those charged by companies for their goods – rose 1.7% year on year in May, up from 1.1% in April. This will eventually feed into consumer price inflation. Input prices, which measure the cost of raw materials and other ‘inputs’, fell by 0.1%, compared with April’s 1.4% drop. Both input and output PPI rates are at their highest levels since May last year. House prices in the UK grew at a faster rate in April, while rental growth eased last month. The Office for National Statistics said average house prices rose by 1.1% in the 12 months to April, up from 0.9% in March. Average private rents climbed by 8.7% in May, down from 8.9% in April. Rents increased to £1,301 (8.6%) in England, £736 (8.5%) in Wales, and £957 (9.3%) in Scotland, in the 12 months to May. In Northern Ireland, average rents increased by 10.3% year-on-year in March. In England, rents inflation was highest in London (10.1%) and lowest in the North East (6.1%). Across Great Britain, average rent was highest in Kensington and Chelsea (£3,397) and lowest in Dumfries and Galloway (£480). Leo Barincou, senior economist at Oxford Economics, has looked more closely at the French election and what it means for the economy and the public finances. The most likely outcome of the French snap elections is a hung parliament. The far-right Rassemblement National (RN) looks all but certain to register major seat gains after its record win in European elections, mostly at the expense of President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist party. This would result in policy paralysis, delaying fiscal consolidation and preventing any meaningful reforms until the next presidential election. However, an alternative scenario, which should not be discounted, is an absolute majority for the far right. This scenario would result in cohabitation, whereby a prime minister from the RN would be free to set domestic policy, while the role of the president would be relegated to foreign policy and defence. Given the wide policy divergences between Macron and the RN, a resignation of the president would be a possibility. Whatever the outcome, France’s public finances are likely to worsen, he said. Whatever the outcome, the gradual fiscal consolidation planned by the current government will be the first casualty of the political crisis, worsening France’s already fraught public finances. A divided parliament is unlikely to be able to agree on politically difficult spending cuts, which would result in a higher deficit than our current baseline. Meanwhile, the implementation of the RN platform as it currently stands would add to the public deficit. Even in the case of a far-right victory, an upheaval in economic policy seems unlikely in the short-term. The party has abandoned its most radical economic ideas such as leaving the single currency. Still, its economic platform of unfunded tax cuts, if implemented, could push government bond yields even higher, after the jump already recorded in the week following Macron’s announcement. The European Commission will name and shame countries with “excessive” debts today, including France. It announces which countries will face the “excessive deficit procedure” (EDP), aimed at correcting excessive deficit and/or debt levels. The commission can launch the procedure against an EU country for not respecting the stability and growth pact, a set of rules governing the coordination of EU countries’ fiscal policies. Brussels is expected to reprimand France for breaching the EU’s borrowing limit of 3% of annual GDP. A bigger clash looms should the far right take power. Goldman Sachs has warned that France’s national debt could surge even higher if Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) party wins an absolute majority in the national assembly elections, which take place in two rounds on 30 June and 7 July. Alongside France, the commission is expected to open an excessive deficit procedure against six other countries: Italy, Belgium, Malta, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. ING economist Francesco Pesole said: The euro has continued to stabilise [versus the dollar] but still seems to be lacking enough steam to meaningfully rebound given lingering political risk and fiscal concerns weighing on the common currency. What shouldn’t help the mood in European markets today is the EU Commission’s announcement of which countries will face the excessive deficit procedure. Italy and Poland already said they will be included in the list, and media reports suggest five more countries will face the infringement procedure – including France. Here is some analysis on the drop in UK inflation from our economics editor Larry Elliott. After almost three years, the UK’s annual inflation rate is back to the government’s 2% target. That ought to be good news for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives – but given the state of the opinion polls it looks like being far too little, far too late. First the good news. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show price pressures are continuing to abate. The headline rate of inflation fell from 2.3% in April to 2% in May – and there were also declines in two closely watched measures of underlying inflation. Inflation excluding volatile items such as food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco dropped from 3.9% to 3.5%, while inflation in the services sector – which tends to be more affected by domestic than global factors – dipped from 5.9% to 5.7%. Food price inflation, which was nudging 20% at its peak in late 2022, now stands at 1.7%, down from 2.9% in April. Grocery bills fell by 0.3% on the month, which will be welcome for less well-off households, who spend proportionately more of their budgets on food. But there were also declines in the inflation rates for clothing and footwear (3.7% to 3%), recreation and culture (4.4% to 3.9%), and restaurants and hotels (6% to 5.8%) because prices rose less rapidly last month than they did in May 2023. Last week’s figures for average earnings showed pay rising at an annual rate of about 6%. With inflation at 2%, that means people are enjoying a chunky rise in living standards, a reversal of the trend in 2022 when inflation peaked at 11.1% and real pay was falling. International comparisons show that the UK’s inflation rate is lower than in Germany (2.8%), France (2.6%), the EU as a whole (2.7%) and the same as the US (2%). The bad news is that there is still some way to go before the Bank of England is ready to declare the war against inflation over. The FTSE 100 index in London has fallen 0.2%, or 16 points, to 8,174, while sterling rose. The pound gained 0.2% against the euro to €.1855, and 0.1% versus the dollar to $1.2727. Markets are now pricing in a 43% chance of a first interest rate cut from the Bank of England in August. European shares are also mostly down, with the German Dax and the French CAC both trading about 0.2% lower, while Itay’s FTSE MiB is 0.2% higher. US markets are closed for a federal holiday today. ING economist Francesco Pesole said: The latest UK services inflation numbers are a bit disappointing for the Bank of England, and the latest figure is 0.4 percentage points above what it had forecast back in the May monetary policy report. Things like rental growth are still pretty strong, though in line with prior months. The data all but confirms the Bank won’t be cutting rates when it meets tomorrow. But we still have another report in July, and unless that’s a material surprise, we suspect it will still leave the BoE on track for a cut in August. The Confederation of British Industry also said a cut in the cost of borrowing is likely in August, despite stubbornly high services inflation. The business lobby group’s principal economist, Martin Sartorius, said: Today’s data sets the stage for the MPC to cut interest rates in August, in line with our latest forecast’s expectations. Interest rate expectations have shifted again following the drop in UK inflation back to its official 2% target. The Bank of England meets tomorrow but is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.25%. The probability of a cut tomorrow is estimated at just over 5%. The central bank has been keeping a close eye on services inflation, which eased from 5.9% to 5.7%, but remains stubbornly high. Even so, the fall in headline inflation boosted hopes of a rate cut in August. Markets are fully pricing in a move by September, and are expecting another cut by December. Rishi Sunak said the fall in inflation was “great news” – but warned that it could rise again if Labour wins the general election on 4 July. The prime minister said: Great news this morning that inflation is back to normal at 2%. That’s lower than Germany, France and America. When I became Prime Minister, inflation was at 11%. But we took bold action. We stuck to a clear plan and that’s why the economy has now turned a corner. So, let’s not put all that progress at risk with Labour. Prices for recreational and cultural goods and services rose at an annual rate of 4.1% in the year to May, down from 4.6%, today’s inflation figures showed. Prices of pets and related products, and books fell between April and May this year, compared with a monthly rise a year ago. Prices of package holidays and cultural services rose this year by less than a year ago. Furniture and household goods also contributed to the fall in headline inflation. On an annual basis, those prices fell by 1.8% in the year to May, compared with a fall of 0.9% in the year to April. The annual rate in May was the lowest since December 2000. Here’s more detail on what happened to food prices. Breakfast cereals, potato crisps and bars of chocolate have become cheaper. The main downward effects on the inflation rate came from bread and cereals, vegetables, and sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery. In each case, prices fell between April and May this year, compared with a monthly rise a year ago. The resulting annual rates were the lowest since October 2021 for the first two categories and since June 2022 for sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery, the statistics office said. Annual rates eased in nine of the 11 food and soft drink categories, with the exception of oils and fats, and milk, cheese and eggs. Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chancellor, said: After 14 years of economic chaos under the Conservatives, working people are worse off. Prices have risen in the shops, mortgage bills are higher and taxes are at a 70-year high. Labour has a plan to make people better off bringing stability back to our economy, unlocking investment and delivering reform. All the Conservatives are offering is a desperate wish list of unfunded spending promises that will mean £4,800 more on people’s mortgages. The choice at the election is simple: stability with Labour that will make Britain better off or five more years of chaos with the Conservatives that will mean higher mortgages. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: Over the last three years UK families have suffered the highest prices rises in the G7 – with inflation going up more over that period than it usually does over an entire decade. Ministers can try to rewrite history all they like. But the Conservatives have presided over the worst period for living standards in modern times. Food and energy bills have surged. Rents and mortgages have skyrocketed. And real wages are still worth less than in 2008. Working people have paid the price for this government’s failure with household debt also increasing at record levels. We can’t go on like this. We need a government that will make work pay. Jake Finney, economist at PwC UK, said today marks a “decisive moment in the fight against inflation,” as it is the first time CPI inflation has returned to the Bank of England’s 2% target in almost three years. This is the longest period that inflation has exceeded the 2% target since the early 2010s, when it took four years to return to target. However, during that period inflation only peaked at 5.2%, compared to a peak of 11.1% in October 2022. Consumer prices have risen by 20% since inflation was last at target. In the three years prior to this inflation episode, prices had risen by just 5%. That means the cumulative increase in prices has been roughly four-times faster than in more normal times. The one saving grace for households is that nominal earnings have increased by 18% over the same period, preventing a sharper decline in living standards. However, it is not ‘job done’ yet. If prices continue to rise at the same month-on-month rate as they did this month (0.3%), then headline inflation will be back over the 2% target next month (at 2.1%). This is because underlying momentum remains above levels that are consistent with the 2% target, particularly with regards to services inflation.” Here is some instant reaction. Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at the asset manager abrdn, said: The fall of headline inflation back to target was expected, but will still come as extremely welcome news to the Bank of England. The big question now is whether underlying inflation pressures in the economy are consistent with inflation staying around 2% in the medium term, or whether inflation will start to edge higher again once favourable base effects fade. On that front, there is still evidence of residual stickiness in services inflation, reflecting the strength of wage growth recently. That is why an interest rate cut tomorrow is still very unlikely. But we think the Bank’s communication tomorrow will set out a path for a cut in August, which is now looking increasingly likely. It is the first time inflation has met the Bank of England’s 2% target since July 2021. This is mainly because food price rises have eased. Prices of food and soft drinks rose by 1.7% in the year to May, down from 2.9% in April, and the lowest rate since October 2021. Food price inflation has eased for 14 months from a peak of 19.2% in March last year, the highest annual rate seen for more than 45 years. Here is our full story: Inflation in the UK has fallen to an annual rate of 2% in May, as expected. It’s down from 2.3% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics. Core inflation which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, as they tend to be volatile, has slowed to 3.5% from 3.9%, also as expected. The largest downward effects came from food and soft drinks, recreation and culture, and furniture and household goods. Transport, namely fuel, provided the largest, partially offsetting, upward contribution. Unsecured household debt is set to rise by more than £1,600 this year as families continue to struggle with the cost of living crisis, according to new TUC analysis. Unsecured debt (loans, credit cards, purchase hire agreements) is on course to increase by 9.4% in real terms (adjusted for inflation), on average, per household this year. Over a quarter of people say they have taken out loans or borrowed on credit cards to cover unexpected bills since the start of the year. The TUC says that this is the largest annual rise – in cash terms – since records began in 1987. The union body says the findings make a mockery of government claims that “their plan is working”. The analysis excludes student loans. Separate TUC polling, carried out by YouGov, shows that millions are continuing to struggle with the cost of living: 4 in 10 (42%) say they’ve cut back on essentials like food and utility spending this year. And this number rises to nearly 1 in 2 (47%) for women. 6 in 10 (60%) say they have cut back on non-essential spending like dining out and entertainment since the beginning of the year. Nearly a fifth (19%) of respondents say they have fallen behind on household bills this year – a number that rises to over 1 in 4 (28%) for people aged 18-24. Over quarter (27%) say have they taken out debt (loans, credit) to cover unexpected bills since the start of the year. This number shoots up to over a third (37%) for adults aged 25-49 – when lots of families raise children. UK workers are on course for nearly two decades of lost living standards, with real wages not forecast to recover to their 2008 level until 2026. The TUC estimates that the average worker would be £14,700 better off if their pay had grown at the same pace as pre-financial crisis real wage growth trends since 2008. Its general secretary Paul Nowak said: These findings show out of touch this Conservative government is with people’s struggles. While the Tories boast about their plan working, households across Britain are being pushed further into debt. No one should have to rely on credit cards and loans to make ends meet. But after 14 years of flatlining wages – and the worst cost of living crisis in generations - many families are at breaking point. The Tories economic record speaks for itself. Pay packets are still worth less today than in 2008 with working people on course to end this parliament poorer than at the start. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It’s UK inflation day! In just a few minutes, we will find out whether inflation across the country has continued to slow, to the official target of 2%. Economists are predicting that the headline annual rate fell to 2% in May from 2.3% in April, partly because of lower energy prices. That was the lowest rate in almost three years, although the decline was smaller than expected, and dashed hopes of an early interest rate cut. The Bank of England is mandated by the government to keep consumer price inflation at an annual rate of 2%. The figures are released at 7am BST by the Office for National Statistics. Core inflation which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, as they tend to be volatile, is forecast to have fallen to 3.5% from 3.9%. The central bank will keep a close eye on the services inflation number, which remained at 5.9% in April. Investec economist Sandra Horsfield said: UK inflation has certainly come a long way since the monetary policy committee (MPC) last hiked rates in August: the latest consumer price index (CPI) outturn the MPC faced at that time was for June 2023, when headline inflation was 7.9% year-on-year and core inflation 6.9%. By April 2024, the corresponding rates reached 2.3% and 3.9%, respectively. We see a number of factors as likely to have pulled down inflation. One is that goods price inflation remains on a downward trend: lower energy prices are still gradually filtering through supply chains, and import prices are falling as China leans on manufacturing exports as an engine of growth. On the services side, wages continue to add to firms’ costs; but even there, the trend in wage growth is downwards, if only moderately. This should have added up to a lower rate of ‘core’ inflation. We will also get producer price figures, which measure factory gate inflation – this eventually feeds into consumer price rises.

        "title": "The man who built Docklands: from poverty in Romania to Canary Wharf’s skyscrapers",
        "content": "One of the main players behind the transformation of London Docklands into a powerful financial centre is stepping back after nearly four decades. George Iacobescu is retiring as the chair of Canary Wharf Group next month, to be replaced by the former L&amp;G chief executive Nigel Wilson. The move comes as a number of high-profile tenants plan to leave the area, but Iacobescu said it was still “a thriving community in the heart of the old East End”. He added: “With the continuing growth of the tech sector, health and life sciences, new leisure activities and the greening of the Wharf, there are exciting times ahead for the estate.” Born in Romania in 1945, Iacobescu grew up, like many Romanians at the time, with very little money under the ruling communist government. He once said his mother-in-law had to bring her own lightbulb to a medical operation. This was the only bulb in her home, and meant her flat was left in the dark for the day. He initially wanted to be a doctor like his father but was pushed to take up engineering after the latter told him to get into construction because “the world will never stop building”. Taking his father’s words to heart, he studied civil engineering in Bucharest. After working as a structural engineer in Romania between 1969 and 1975, he was able to leave the country for Canada after getting help from a relative in North America. While in Canada, he got a job with the developer Olympia &amp; York (O&amp;Y) and was heavily involved in building Chicago’s Olympia Centre skyscraper and the vast World Financial Centre in New York. His relationship with what would become London’s new financial district began in 1987, when he was sent to London from Toronto by the O&amp;Y founder Paul Reichmann to investigate whether it was feasible to build on the abandoned docklands site. The site had been designated an enterprise zone by Margaret Thatcher, with her government offering generous tax breaks to investors and promising to extend London Underground lines to the site. On visiting the site that had been derelict for years, he got lost for more than two hours, and concluded when he got back to Canada that O&amp;Y “shouldn’t touch the site”. Reichmann ignored him, pushed ahead with the project, and Iacobescu was made its construction director. After four years, his initial misgivings were nearly proved right. Delays to the promised Jubilee line and Docklands Light Railway left Canary Wharf without important transport links, which stymied investment. After a property crash in 1992, banks refused O&amp;Y credit and it had to file for bankruptcy, placing Canary Wharf into administration. Reichmann was able to persuade investors to support him to buy back Canary Wharf in 1995 for £800m. By 1997, Iacobescu had become the chief executive, a role he would hold until 2021, while also taking on the chair role in 2011. During that time, Canary Wharf has grown to become one of the largest urban regeneration projects in Europe, now containing 6,000,000 sq ft (1,500,000m2) of office and retail space, and the main workplace for 120,000 workers before the Covid pandemic. His services were rewarded with a knighthood in 2012, becoming the only Romanian-born British citizen to receive the honour. However, his tenure has not been without its challenges. He was at the helm when Canary Wharf Group floated in 1999 and was also in charge in 2004, when an 11-month bidding war led to Morgan Stanley taking control of it from the the investment fund Brascan, which had the backing of Reichmann. He also led Canary Wharf Group when it was bought by Qatar’s Sovereign Wealth fund and Canadian Brookfield Properties for £2.6bn in 2015. The deal would take it private again. His biggest hurdle in recent times has been the pandemic and the increase in working from home, which has hit the office market. This has prompted announcements by the likes of HSBC, which had occupied its own tower since 2002, and Clifford Chance that they would leave the area.",

        "title": "Berkeley returns to build-to-rent market amid London housing shortage",
        "content": "The housebuilder Berkeley is to go back into the private rental market for the first time in a decade by launching a build-to-rent arm to tackle the “severe shortage” of properties in and around London. The company, which built 3,500 private-sale homes last year, will establish the build-to-rent business, which aims to create 4,000 homes in London and the south-east over the next decade. Berkeley plans to develop the properties across 17 brownfield sites and launch a dedicated online platform to manage them. On Wednesday, Berkeley reported a pre-tax profit of £557m for the year to 30 April 2024, down from £604m last year. However, it has increased its pre-tax profit guidance for 2025 by 5% to £525m. The company was founded in 1976 by the late Tony Pidgley and has established itself as one of the country’s largest housebuilders, focusing on developments in London, the south of England and Birmingham. The launch of a build-to-rent arm marks a return to the rental market for Berkeley, which built and managed a portfolio of 900 rental homes between 2011 and 2014. It said the move was a natural extension of its strategy and recognised the “severe shortage of high-quality rental accommodation”. A shortage of rental homes in the capital has caused average rents to soar. The property website Zoopla recorded average rents in London at £2,122 a month, up 3.7% on last year. The real estate firm JLL forecasts rents could rise by nearly 19% in Greater London by 2028. Berkeley said it would finance the new portfolio through internal sources, debt secured against the rental properties and third-party capital funding. Rob Perrins, the chief executive, said: “Recognising the strong occupational and institutional investment demand for high-quality, well-managed rental homes in London and the south-east, Berkeley is establishing its own build-to-rent platform to maximise returns in today’s market conditions.” Commenting on the results, Perrins said: “This is a strong performance in a challenging and volatile operating environment, demonstrating the resilience of Berkeley’s business model with its focus on the country’s most undersupplied markets.” The trading update listed a series of requests for the next government to improve conditions for housebuilders. These included greater resources for stretched local authority planning teams and refinancing housing associations so they could concentrate on providing more homes. It said the new government needed to refrain from making significant changes to the market and instead resolve the small operational challenges in the planning and regulatory system to make it faster and more predictable. In their manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to build a record number of homes on brownfield land in urban areas by providing a fast-track route through the planning system for developments, while also pledging to build 1.6m homes during the next parliament. Labour has promised to deliver 1.5m homes over the next parliament and immediately reinstate mandatory housing targets for local authorities, which were scrapped in 2022 by the government. Berkeley’s shares fell by nearly 4% on Wednesday, valuing the company at £5bn.",

        "title": "Labour says pressure on family finances still acute as UK inflation falls to 2%",
        "content": "The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said pressure on household finances remains “acute” despite official figures showing inflation fell to 2% in May, returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the consumer prices index (CPI) had eased in May, down from 2.3% in April, raising expectations of a cut in borrowing costs by the Bank of England. Lower prices growth will give encouragement to Rishi Sunak after the prime minister made bringing inflation under control one of his main aims. The release of the inflation figures represents one of the last significant economic indicators before the vote on 4 July. Sunak said the fall in inflation was “great news” and meant consumer prices were rising at a slower rate than in Germany, France and the US. “When I became prime minister inflation was at 11%. But we took bold action. We stuck to a clear plan and that’s why the economy has now turned a corner,” he said. However, Reeves said inflation under the Conservatives had left “working people worse off”. She told the BBC: “Of course it’s welcome that inflation has returned to target for the first time in nearly three years. But, unlike Conservative ministers, I’m not going to claim that everything is all fine, that the cost of living crisis is over, because I know that pressures on family finances are still acute, because, while inflation is down, of course, those higher prices still remain. “Prices have risen in the shops, mortgage bills are higher and taxes are at a 70-year high.” The TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, said the fall in inflation masked three years when “UK families have suffered the highest prices rises in the G7 – with inflation going up more over that period than it usually does over an entire decade”. The decline was in line with predictions from City economists and marked the first time inflation hit the Bank’s 2% target since July 2021. The central bank is still expected to keep interest rates at 5.25% when it publishes its decision on Thursday. Until recently, financial markets were betting the Bank would make its first cut in the cost of borrowing at a meeting in November. Investors now expect the first cut in September and a further cut in December. The Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) aims to keep inflation at about 2% but has forecast a rise later in the year back towards 3%, before a fall again next year to 2%. Figures from the ONS showed the rising cost of food and beverages eased along with furniture and the price of household goods. Analysts said the high level of core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as food and fuel, would be concerning to the central bank. Core inflation was 3.5% in the 12 months to May, down from 3.9% in April. The rising price of services, which eased from 5.9% to 5.7%, was one of the main factors keeping core inflation elevated. Service industries have complained that they experienced increased IT and labour costs, which they were forced to pass on to consumers. Average wages excluding bonuses rose by 6% in the three months to the end of April. Sanjay Raja, the chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank Research, said services inflation was “the key gauge watched by policymakers” and there was a widening gap with the central bank’s forecasts. “The wedge between the Bank’s projection and actual data widened a little more, adding to concerns that services prices may be a little stickier than anticipated. It will raise the bar for an August rate cut.” However, the Confederation of British Industry said a cut in the cost of borrowing was likely in August, despite stubbornly high services inflation. The business lobby group’s principal economist, Martin Sartorius, said: “Today’s data sets the stage for the MPC to cut interest rates in August, in line with our latest forecast’s expectations.” Housing costs, which include mortgage interest payments, property transaction charges and maintenance bills, increased by 6.7% over the past year, up from 6.6% in the 12 months to April. The ONS said it was highest annual rate since records began in 1992. Housing is not included in the CPI. An alternative index that includes owner-occupier’s housing costs, the consumer prices index including housing (CPIH), also fell, but from 3% in April to 2.8% in May. In May last year, inflation was 8.7%, down from more than 11% in October 2022, the highest rate in more than 40 years.",

        "content": "After almost three years, the UK’s annual inflation rate is back to the government’s 2% target. That ought to be good news for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives – but given the state of the opinion polls it looks like being far too little, far too late. First the good news. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show price pressures are continuing to abate. The headline rate of inflation fell from 2.3% in April to 2% in May and there were also declines in two closely watched measures of underlying inflation. Inflation excluding volatile items such as food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco dropped from 3.9% to 3.5%, while inflation in the services sector – which tends to be more affected by domestic than global factors – dipped from 5.9% to 5.7%. Food price inflation, which was nudging 20% at its peak in late 2022, now stands at 1.7%, down from 2.9% in April. Grocery bills fell by 0.3% on the month, which will be welcome for less well-off households, who spend proportionately more of their budgets on food. There were also declines in the inflation rates for clothing and footwear (3.7% to 3%), recreation and culture (4.4% to 3.9%), and restaurants and hotels (6% to 5.8%) because prices rose less rapidly last month than they did in May 2023. Last week’s figures for average earnings showed pay rising at an annual rate of about 6%. With inflation at 2%, that means people are enjoying a chunky rise in living standards, a reversal of the trend in 2022 when inflation peaked at 11.1% and real pay was falling. International comparisons show that the UK’s inflation rate is lower than those in Germany (2.8%), France (2.6%) and the EU as a whole (2.7%) and the same as that in the US (2%). The bad news is that there is still some way to go before the Bank of England is ready to declare the war against inflation over. At 5.7%, service sector inflation is still higher than Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee (MPC) would like, and while Sunak would greatly welcome a cut in interest rates from the Bank on Thursday it isn’t going to happen. The MPC’s meeting in early August looks a much likelier time for borrowing costs to start coming down. Overall, the economy has emerged from the cost of living crisis in better shape than might have been feared in late 2022, after only the mildest of technical recessions despite interest rates being raised from 0.1% to 5.25% between December 2021 and August 2023. But it will take time for voters to forget the squeeze on their living standards caused by the highest inflation in four decades, and time is not on Sunak’s side. The beneficiary of inflation coming back to target will not be the current occupant of 10 Downing Street. It will be Keir Starmer.",

        "title": "Advice to Rachel Reeves: rename the national wealth fund | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "Here’s a plea to Rachel Reeves, assuming she is the next chancellor: please give your new national wealth fund a different name. The title is misleading because, whether intentionally or not, it conjures images of a Norway-style sovereign wealth fund – a vehicle to accumulate vast long-term riches for the benefit of today’s citizens and future generations. In reality, Labour’s national wealth fund will be nothing like a sovereign wealth fund, even if it is sometimes misreported as being one. It would be a fine thing if we had such a vehicle but, sadly, the time to launch one was circa 1990, as the far-sighted Norwegians did, when North Sea oil revenues were booming. With the benefit of regular capital injections, plus the wonder of compound returns over long investment horizons, the value of the Norwegian fund is now $1.6tn. That is equivalent to half the UK’s national debt. By contrast, the new national wealth fund will invest a mere £7.3bn over the course of the next parliament – and the cash will come from borrowing. And, unlike a sovereign wealth fund that invests around the globe to spread risk, Labour’s fund will concentrate on a narrow sector of the UK economy. The party’s manifesto details £1.8bn directed at ports, £1.5bn for gigafactories, £2.5bn to clean steel, £1bn for carbon capture and £500m to green hydrogen. Therein lies the real purpose: this is a state-backed vehicle to co-invest alongside private sector companies in order, it is hoped, to accelerate growth in areas related to the green economy. It will be able to take equity stakes, lend directly and underwrite loans. But the core part of the mission is to attract £3 of private investment for every £1 of public investment. That 3:1 ratio looks achievable because it is what the old “green investment bank” (also misnamed, because it wasn’t a bank) achieved before George Osborne, having set it up during the coalition years, shockingly sold it to Macquarie for £1.6bn in 2017. The national wealth fund will be bigger than the green bank but will be similarly aimed at hard-to-finance projects and should also have an arms-length investment manager to impose commercial discipline. One practical challenge will be to ensure the investments are genuinely aimed at additional projects. There is little point in de-risking schemes for the Dubai-backed owner of the Southampton and London Gateway ports, which can stand on its own feet. But backing upgrades to smaller ports so they can handle floating offshore wind installations? Yes, on the right financial terms: that could clearly be worthwhile and have knock-on benefits for UK jobs. A less-clear part is how the fund will avoid stepping on the toes of GB Energy, Labour’s separate creation aimed at energy generation. The lines look blurry. And it’s unclear how the national wealth fund, which won’t make grants, will handle projects that often require straightforward state subsidy – gigafactories and clean steel plants tend to fall into that camp. The advisory taskforce will be crucial in laying down the rules of engagement: it includes Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England; Dame Amanda Blanc, the chief executive of the insurer Aviva; and CS Venkatakrishnan, the chief executive of Barclays. The mood in the business world is cautiously positive, even if Reeves’s claim of hundreds of thousands of new industrial jobs is viewed sceptically. Aside from the pro-growth signal, companies tend to like the idea of a formal structure around public-private partnerships. Smoother processes can make life simpler, which is half the challenge in an era of global competition for green capital. But the name of the fund is still a shocker. A sum of £7.3bn is not blow-the-doors-off, and some schemes may offer only borderline direct returns for the state, whatever the job-creation benefits. A “green transition fund” sounds less exciting, but would avoid anybody thinking the UK is about to be nationally wealthy.",

        "title": "Unsecured household debts set to rise by 9.4% this year, TUC says",
        "content": "UK households are expected to rack up extra unsecured debts of more than £1,600 this year, including on loans and credit cards, as the cost of living crisis continues to bite, according to a TUC analysis. The TUC said its analysis showed that unsecured household debt – including loans and credit cards but excluding mortgages and, for this exercise, student loans – was on course to increase by 9.4%, or £1,660, in real terms on average per household this year. It added that this was the largest annual rise in cash terms since records began in 1987. The trade union body said its findings made a mockery of government claims that “the plan is working” to cut inflation and reduce the pressure on household finances. The TUC’s data coincided with official figures showing that a record number of people in England and Wales took out a debt relief order (DRO) – a form of insolvency whereby individuals can get their debts written off – in May. The TUC said it used official debt data and Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts to produce its analysis. During the cost of living crisis, some borrowing costs have hit record highs, piling the pressure on consumers as bigger housing, energy and food bills force households to put more on credit and take out loans. On 31 May, the Bank of England revealed that the effective interest rates on overdrafts and credit cards increased by 55 and 20 basis points, to 22.76% and 21.46% respectively. The effective rate on new personal loans to individuals, meanwhile, rose by 62 basis points to 9.01%. The TUC said that polling carried out for it by YouGov last month showed that millions of people continued to struggle with the cost of living. More than four in 10 of those surveyed said they had cut back on essentials such as food and utility spending this year, while 60% said they had reduced non-essential spending, including dining out and entertainment. About a fifth of respondents to the poll of more than 2,000 people said they had fallen behind on household bills in recent months. The TUC has estimated that UK workers are on course for “nearly two decades of lost living standards”, with real wages not forecast to recover to their 2008 level until 2026. It claimed the average worker would now be £14,700 better off if their pay had kept up with pre-crisis real wage growth trends since 2008. Last month, when it emerged that UK inflation had fallen to 2.3% in April, its lowest level for almost three years, Rishi Sunak said: “This is proof that the plan is working and that the difficult decisions we have taken are paying off.” But Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said its findings “show how out of touch this Conservative government is with people’s struggles”. Figures from the Insolvency Service showed that the number of DROs taken out by individuals reached a new record monthly high of 3,716 – up 8% on the previous record set in April 2024. A DRO is a solution to help people deal with personal debts they cannot pay, and they are viewed by some as a low-cost alternative to bankruptcy.",

        "title": "Hargreaves Lansdown says it will accept private equity buyout offer",
        "content": "British investment fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown has said it will accept a proposed offer from a trio of private equity investors, meaning another of the UK’s biggest companies will leave the FTSE 100 index. In a stock market filing on Tuesday, the company said that the US private equity firm CVC, Denmark’s Nordic Capital and a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) had made an offer worth £11.40 a share in cash. It was the fourth proposed offer in recent months, Hargreaves Lansdown said. The first, revealed in May, was worth £9.85 a share. Hargreaves Lansdown’s share price has risen by more than half since the end of February. Its share price was up 5% on Tuesday, hitting £11.30, in response to the proposal, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100. The bidders have until 5pm on 19 July to make a firm offer, after the company asked for an extension to the deadline under takeover rules. If successful, the buyout would add Hargreaves Lansdown to a long list of companies leaving the FTSE 100 index. Some UK executives and investors are concerned that London-listed companies are undervalued compared with peers in the US. Recent departures from the FTSE 100 include the building materials company CRH, which last year shifted its main stock market listing to the US, and the Anglo-German tourism company Tui, which voted to move its main listing from London to Frankfurt earlier this year. The Bristol-based Hargreaves Lansdown pioneered the business of selling units of investment funds online. At the end of March it administered £150bn in assets for 1.86 million clients. However, the company’s share price has struggled in recent years, with analysts concerned about rising costs and risks relating to a major investment plan. The private equity offer values Hargreaves Landown at just over half of its 2019 peak. Its billionaire founders, Peter Hargreaves and Stephen Lansdown, are still major shareholders, with stakes that would be valued at £1.07bn and £308m respectively if they were to sell, according to analysis of data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Shareholders will also be able to continue to hold their investments in the unlisted company if the sale goes ahead. The company said that it “remains confident in management’s ability to execute Hargreaves Lansdown’s strategic priorities” and in the company’s “fundamental longer-term prospects”, but added that the board would be “willing to recommend” an offer at the new offer price.",

        "title": "Workers at Premier Inn owner protest at AGM against plans to cut 1,500 jobs",
        "content": "Workers demonstrated at Premier Inn owner Whitbread’s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday over plans to cut 1,500 jobs amid rising profits. The employees of restaurants including Brewers Fayre, Table Table and Beefeater protested outside the company’s investor meeting in Dunstable, Bedfordshire on Tuesday and union activists asked about the job cuts and pay inside the meeting. The Unite union has written to Whitbread saying it was considering launching employment tribunal claims for unfair dismissal over the cuts. The union, which is not formally recognised by Whitbread but says it represents hundreds of the people who may lose their jobs, claims that a statutory 45-day consultation with those affected, which kicked off in late April, has not been conducted in a “genuine or meaningful way”. It says there is no evidence that Whitbread has considered alternatives to redundancy despite the company reporting a 36% rise in underlying profit to £561m. One Whitbread worker, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “We are still only being drip-fed information with little to no time to process or evaluate options.” Several workers who live in accommodation linked to their job have been told they will be served with eviction notices in July and August, when the bulk of redundancies are expected to be implemented. Whitbread announced the cuts in April, while simultaneously reporting a 36% rise in profits to £561m and raising its final dividend for each share by 26% to 62.9p. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said: “Rarely is a company so shameless as to celebrate leaping profits and dividends by announcing mass job cuts. “But generating runaway profits while trampling workers is business as usual for Whitbread. This is a firm that refuses to pay the real living wage and does not even provide company sick pay for its underpaid and overworked staff.” On Tuesday, Whitbread said sales rose 1% to £739m in the three months to 30 May, driven by improved trading in the UK and Germany. Accommodation revenues were up 15% but the company said food and beverage sales fell 1% as strong uptake of breakfasts from hotel guests was offset by softer trading in its branded restaurants – many of which it is aiming to close. Dominic Paul, the chief executive of Whitbread, said the company’s plan to “optimise food and beverage at a number of sites” and add 3,500 hotel rooms in the UK “is on track and will increase our momentum to deliver long-term profitable growth”. Whitbread has said the restaurants it was closing were loss-making and its profit rise came from its hotels business. It has said it did not accept the union’s allegations, and had “a comprehensive and transparent collective consultation process” in place.",

        "content": "I write in response to Oliver Wainwright’s piece about our proposed building for Marks &amp; Spencer on London’s Oxford Street (‘Public vandalism’: M&amp;S wants to flatten its art deco flagship store – here are six alternative options, 7 June). As architects, we understand the benefits of retrofit, but at Oxford Street it simply isn’t feasible. Our proposal secured support from Westminster council, the London mayor and the independent planning inspector. The highly experienced and wholly independent inquiry inspector dismissed Save Britain’s Heritage’s retrofit scheme as “so deeply problematic, even for Oxford Street, that no-one would be likely to pursue it or fund it”. The site contains three buildings of poor quality – unlisted and excluded from the surrounding conservation areas – with misaligned floor levels, cores and column grids, resulting in a confusing environment for customers that is highly problematic for M&amp;S – or any retailer – to operate. The consulting engineer Arup showed that Save’s retrofit could be more carbon-intensive than redevelopment. That is before factoring in the superior operational performance of the new building, which would be in the top 1% in the UK. None of the ideas put forward in the Architects’ Journal overcome these fundamental issues, and they are not commercially deliverable. As well as modern retail, the project will deliver high-quality office space that is vital for the West End to remain a world-class commercial centre, supporting thousands of jobs, lowering car-reliance and accelerating transition to net zero. Far from an act of vandalism, this long-term investment is an act of placemaking: a positive vision for the nation’s high street and a showcase of UK expertise delivering world-class, low-carbon design. It will be a building of which London will be rightly proud. Fred Pilbrow Pilbrow &amp; Partners",

        "title": "Electric carmaker Fisker files for US bankruptcy protection",
        "content": "The electric car company Fisker has filed for US bankruptcy protection, making it the latest EV startup to collapse trying to challenge the established car industry. The company was started in 2016 by the husband-and-wife team Henrik Fisker and Geeta Gupta-Fisker. It is the second attempt by Fisker, a former Aston Martin design chief, to establish an EV challenger that has ended in bankruptcy. Alongside focusing on green manufacturing methods, Fisker also used an unusual “asset-light” production model. This relied on contract manufacturers to assemble its cars, avoiding the huge investments required to build factories. The company blamed supplier delays for missed production targets and struggled to hit ambitious sales forecasts after complaints of mechanical issues with the few thousand cars it sold. Fisker had said it was in negotiations with an unnamed large automaker over a possible investment in the company, joint development of the technology underlying electric cars, and manufacturing in North America. However, those talks came to nothing, and it was forced to halt manufacturing its Ocean SUV in March. The prospect of a switch from petrol and diesel to electric cars – alongside Elon Musk’s success with Tesla – has prompted a host of entrepreneurs to challenge incumbents. However, many of them have failed after spending billions in investor cash that had been raised in a bubble during the coronavirus turmoil. EV startups have faced a number of headwinds. Rising interest rates have made it much harder for loss-making companies to find funding, and has weighed on demand for electric cars that remain more expensive than petrol or diesel equivalents, even if total running costs are lower on average. Increasing competition in the electric vehicle space – particularly from China – has also put pressure on manufacturers to cut prices, making profitability harder. US failures include Lordstown Motors, which was once feted by Donald Trump as the saviour of the Ohio town from which it took its name, and Proterra, a bus and battery company. Both collapsed in 2023. Proterra’s collapse took down one of its British customers, Volta Trucks, which has since tried to restart with new funding. Another British electric vehicle champion, Arrival – which was valued at $15bn after a splashy New York listing in 2021 – collapsed in February. Although BYD is Tesla’s biggest electric car rival, Chinese manufacturers have not been immune to challenges in the market. WM Motor filed for bankruptcy in October, while Nio had to be bailed out by local government. Fisker blamed wider economic conditions for its woes. It said in a statement: “Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted our ability to operate efficiently. After evaluating all options for our business, we determined that proceeding with a sale of our assets under Chapter 11 is the most viable path forward for the company.” The US Chapter 11 process applies to the company’s operating subsidiary, giving it protection from creditors while it tries to negotiate further.",

        "content": "HSBC’s Swiss private banking arm breached money-laundering rules by failing to carry out adequate checks on the high-risk accounts of two politically exposed individuals, Switzerland’s banking regulator has found. HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) has been banned from taking on any new high-risk customers until it has completed a full review of its business relationships, Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma) said. The watchdog found that the bank had operated two high-risk business relationships where it had failed to carry out an adequate check of either the origins, purpose or background of the assets involved. A number of high-risk transactions were insufficiently clarified and documented, making it impossible to establish their legitimate nature. They were carried out between 2002 and 2015 and totalled more than $300m (£236m, €279m). The funds, which originated from a government institution, were transferred from Lebanon to Switzerland and, usually after a short time, flowed back to other accounts in Lebanon. HSBC said it would appeal against the decision. It said: “We acknowledge the matters raised by Finma, which are historic. HSBC takes its anti-money-laundering obligations very seriously including complying with all laws and regulations in every market we operate in. As we plan to appeal the decision it would be inappropriate to comment further.” Finma, which opened enforcement proceedings against HSBC in December 2021, said it had “breached its obligations in the prevention of money laundering in connection with two politically exposed persons and thereby seriously violated financial market law”. The regulator said that until the measures had been implemented in full, the bank may not enter into any new business relationships with politically exposed persons. It added that the bank had cooperated with Finma. The watchdog has ordered the bank to review all its high-risk business relationships and business relationships with politically exposed persons. It must also check the correct categorisation of the risks presented by other customers. An audit agent will monitor the implementation of these measures on site, and report to Finma.",

        "title": "France now ‘most unloved’ European stock market; Le Pen victory would push up French debt, warns Goldman Sachs – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to recap… France’s stock market has become the least favourite in Europe, according to a poll of fund managers by Bank of America. Goldman Sachs has warned that a victory for Marine Le Pen’s party in France’s elections would trigger a surge in the national debt. HSBC’s Swiss private bank failed to conduct proper checks on $300m worth of funds sent between Lebanon and Switzerland during a period of 13 years, Switzerland’s banking regulator has said. The board of Hargreaves Lansdown is willing to back a takeover offer from a private equity consortium that would value the UK’s largest investment site at £5.4bn. US retail sales barely rose in May, suggesting that economic activity remained lackluster. HSBC has said the money laundering breaches raised by Swiss regulator FINMA today (see here) were “historic”. The bank added: “HSBC takes its anti-money laundering obligations very seriously including complying with all laws and regulations in every market we operate in.” HSBC is planning to appeal the decision and so would not be commenting further. Investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown has received a new takeover proposal from a group of private equity buyers, worth £5.4bn. This revised proposal follows three previous approaches in recent months from a consortium of CVC Advisers Limited, Nordic Capital and Platinum Ivy of Abu Dhabi. They are now proposing to pay 1,140p per Hargreaves Lansdown share in cash, up from the 985p/share offer which was rejected in April. Hargreaves Lansdown board says it is willing to recommend this new proposal unanimously to shareholders, if a firm offer is made, and will provide the consortium with access to carry out due diligence work. Shares in Hargreaves Lansdown have jumped 5%, to £11.27. Goldman Sachs’ warning that a far-right government could drive up France’s national debt (see here) comes at a politically sensitive time. Tomorrow, the European Commission is expected to name and shame EU members who have failed to keep to its budget rules, to aim for annual deficits of 3% and debt at 60% of GDP. France (which ran a deficit of 5.5% of GDP last year, and a debt of 110.6%) could easily fall foul of the excessive deficit procedure, which could potentially lead to a fine. France has long got away with breaching the eurozone’s budget rules, granted a laxity that southern European members could only dream of. But with Marine Le Pen’s party riding high in the polls, the European establishment may take a tougher line. As Politico puts it: After all, it’s one thing to let off a pro-EU, statesmanlike leader for the type of reckless spending that endangers the economic stability of the eurozone. It’s quite another if it’s carried out brazenly by a nationalist firebrand who doesn’t think the rules are worth the paper they’re written on in the first place. “If an irresponsible [French spending] plan was put on the table, and the Commission said ‘no problem,’ then the whole fiscal framework is lost,” said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Brussels’ influential think tank Bruegel, referring to the way the EU’s executive arm gets to run the rule over governments’ budgets. “Other populist parties would forever disregard the rules.” Wall Street isn’t spooked by the weaker-than-expected US retail sales figures. Stock futures have moved a little higher, while the yield (or interest rate) on US government debt has fallen (showing that prices have risen). Poor economic news could be good for the markets, if it prompts the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates soon…. Just in: US retail sales rose more slowly than forecast last month. Retail and food services sales across the US rose by 0.1% in May, following a downwardly revised 0.2% fall in April. On an annual basis, retail sales were 2.3% higher than in May 2023, a slowdown on the 2.7% rise recorded in April. This may indicate that demand across the US weakened last month, with consumers weighed down by high interest rates. Michael Brown, analyst at Pepperstone, says the report is a further sign that the ‘US exceptionalism’ narrative has likely run its course. “The May US retail sales report points to further signs of fatigue for the US consumer, with headline sales rising by a meagre 0.1% MoM, up from a downwardly revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.” France’s national debt could surge higher if Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) party wins an absolute majority in the national assembly elections, Goldman Sachs has warned. Goldman predicts that, if in power, the far-right would deliver a sizeable fiscal expansion, sending France’s debt-to-GDP ratio up to 120% by 2027. That highlights why France has turned into the most unloved European equity market (see earlier post). In contrast, under” “a status quo electoral outcome”, debt would stabilise at 113% of GDP in 2027, Goldman estimates. And if France is left with a hung parliament that does not allow any political group to pass meaningful tax or spending measures, debt could rise to 116% of GDP. Goldman points out that political groups have started to outline their economic policy platforms: On labour market reforms, both the left coalition and the far-right oppose the 2023 pension reform, which raised the retirement age. More recently, however, far-right leader Jordan Bardella stated that revisiting the pension system would not be a “near-term priority” and rather would come at a “later stage.” On taxes, both the left coalition and the far-right support cutting VAT on energy and food, as well as re-introducing a wealth tax. At the same time, the current government and the centre-right have pledged not to increase taxes on corporates and households. France has made some progress in lowering its public debt in recent years; in 2023 it was 110.6% of GDP, according to statistics body INSEE, down from 114.9% in 2020. Goldman also warns that the current “ongoing episode of political uncertainty” could hurt the French fiscal outlook, if it leads to higher borrowing costs for Paris. French supermarket giant Carrefour is not sharing in today’s stock market recovery. Shares in Carrefour have tumbled by over 7%, following reports that France’s finance ministry has asked a court to fine the retailer over contracts with franchisee stores that it says were unbalanced in its favour. Carrefour contested the ministry’s “grievances”, saying it was intervening in a dispute that began several months ago without providing new information on the merits, and that it had “full confidence” in its ability to demonstrate the validity of its contracts, Reuters reports. Despite falling in investors’ affections, the French stock market is a little sttonger today. The CAC 40 index is 0.33% higher today, gaining 25 points to 7,596 points. Germany’s DAX has gained 0.15% while the Italian FTSE MIB has gained 1%. Lee Hardman, senior FX strategist at MUFG, says: “Markets have been settling down after last week’s moves in French government bonds and we have had some comments from [Marine] Le Pen saying she was respectful of institutions. Today’s UK insolvency statistics also show there was surge in retail failures this spring. Wholesale and retail trade insolvencies increased by 27% month-on-month in April to 355, up from 280 in March, and were 30% higher than in April 2023. We learned a month ago that overall insolvencies rose by 17% in April, but today we have more details (as well as the top-line data for May). Gordon Thomson, restructuring partner at leading audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, says: “The tough trading environment for the retail sector continues to drag on, resulting in an increase in insolvencies in April. As retailers grapple with high costs, lacklustre consumer demand and too many April showers, they were also hit with an increase in national minimum wage which may have been the final straw for some. “However, with inflation easing, real wages growing, and interest rates set to come down, this bodes well for consumer confidence and sets the stage for an increase in consumer spending in the second half of the year. For those retailers that have managed to weather the storm thus far, there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Just in: HSBC’s private bank has been blocked from taking on any politically exposed people as clients in Switzerland, after violating Swiss money laundering regulations. Swiss financial regulator FINMA has announced that HSBC “seriously violated financial market law” in its handling of high-risk business relationships with two politically exposed people. HSBC failed to carry out an adequate check of either the origins, purpose or background of the assets involved, FINMA says. The regulator explains: The transactions in question were carried out between 2002 and 2015 and amounted to a total of more than $300m. The funds, which originated from a government institution, were transferred from Lebanon to Switzerland and – generally after a short time – primarily flowed back to other accounts in Lebanon. FINMA says HSBC closed these business relationships in 2016, but did not file a report with the Money Laundering Reporting Office until 2020. FINMA has ordered HSBC to review its anti-money laundering aspects, adding: The bank may not enter into any new business relationships with politically exposed persons until such time as completion of the reviews has been confirmed by the audit agent. A strike at Dounreay nuclear power station has been postponed at the last minute, after workers were offered an improved pay deal. Around 600 workers, employed by Nuclear Restoration Services Limited (NRS), had been due to strike on Wednesday, in a pay dispute. The Unite union says the action has been suspended “as a sign of good faith” to allow workers to be balloted on a new pay offer. Staff had previously rejected a pay increase of 4.5% plus a one-off £500 payment, the union says. Unite adds that an overtime ban and an end to working voluntary appointments will continue during the ballot process. If the new offer is rejected by the membership, fresh strike action will be announced. Bank of America’s survey was carried out between June 7 to June 13, which covered much of last week’s stock market tumble in France. As Bloomberg reminds us: …[last week] France’s CAC 40 Index fell the most since in over two years and wiped out $258bn in market capitalization. Investors are anxious about the French national assembly elections because there is a high probability that no party will win an overall majority. Campaigning for the election began yesterday, when a poll of voting intentions showed that Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party currently has 33% support in the first round of the French legislative election, while an alliance of left-wing parties would get 28%. Analysts at UBS suggests there are four possible scenarios for how the elections could play out: Scenario 1: Rassemblement National (RN) with Absolute Majority. This would allow RN to appoint a prime minister and comfortably pass laws, though internal government dissension could pose challenges. The RN’s policies focus on new spending for pensioners and household purchasing power, funded by controlling social spending linked to immigration. Scenario 2: RN with Relative Majority. RN could become the largest party but with less than 289 seats, leading to a complex cohabitation. With the president appointing a prime minister from RN. This scenario would likely result in political deadlock and limited policy changes. Scenario 3: Front Populaire with Relative Majority. The left-wing coalition could win a relative majority, leading to a similar cohabitation scenario with potential deadlock. Their manifesto includes undoing recent pension and unemployment reforms and increasing spending on pensions and purchasing power. Scenario 4: Renaissance 2.0. Macron’s party could maintain a relative majority, continuing to face challenges in passing laws without forming alliances. Macron’s policies would focus on household purchasing power and competitiveness, partially funded by labor reforms and localauthority savings. Bank of America’s Fund Manager Survey also found that global investors remained bullish in June, although inflation remains a top worry. France has turned into the most unloved European equity market, as political uncertainty spooks investors, according to a regular poll from Bank of America. BofA’s European Fund Manager Survey found that investors have grown gloomier about Europe’s growth prospects, partly due to the looming French elections. A net 43% of respondents expect stronger European growth over the coming twelve months, down from 61% last month, which was the highest since July 2021. Enthusiasm has probably been tempered by “rising French political and economic policy uncertainty”, BofA says, along with rising predictions that the US economy will slow and China’s growth will soften. This gloominess has prompted a rotation into defensive stocks, and out of those which benefit from a cyclical upturn. BofA adds: France has turned into investors’ most unloved European equity market, having been the most preferred last month, while Spain is the biggest favourite. Data from Bloomberg yesterday showed that London had regained its crown as Europe’s biggest stock market from Paris. Overnight, US electric car maker Fisker filed for bankruptcy protection, and hopes to sell its assets, after struggling to challenge Tesla in the EV market. Fisker has filed for Chapter 11 protection in the District of Delaware, after failing to find a rescue, three months after suspending all manufacture of its electric vehicles. Fisker suffered a rapid cash burn as it tried to roll out its Ocean SUV cars in the US and Europe. A Fisker spokesperson says: “Fisker has made incredible progress since our founding, bringing the Ocean SUV to market twice as fast as expected in the auto industry and making good on our promises to deliver the most sustainable vehicle in the world. “We are proud of our achievements, and we have put thousands of Fisker Ocean SUVs in customers’ hands in both North American and Europe. But like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted our ability to operate efficiently. After evaluating all options for our business, we determined that proceeding with a sale of our assets under Chapter 11 is the most viable path forward for the company.” Fisker had tried to keep its costs down by using Austrian contract manufacturer, Magna Steyr, to build its car in Graz. The company was founded by Danish automotive designer Henrik Fisker, who had previously designed luxury cars for BMW, Ford, and Aston Martin, such as BMW’s Z8 roadster and the Aston Martin DB9 and Vantage cars. Just in: We have confirmation that inflation across the eurozone accelerated last month. The euro area annual inflation rate was 2.6% in May 2024, up from 2.4% in April, statistics body Eurostat reports – confirming its flash estimate at the end of May. That takes inflation away from the 2% target set by the European Central Bank, which cut interest rates two weeks ago. Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, rose to 2.9% from 2.7% (which also matches the initial estimate). Investors are now pondering how soon the ECB might cut interest rates for a second time this year. Governing council member Boris Vujcic warned yesterday that an interest rate cut in September would require an improvement in the ECB’s inflation outlook. Vujcic explained: “In order to do more, we need to see more. Any prolongation of the inflation conversion toward the medium-term target weakens the case for an interest-rate cut, and vice versa.” David Hudson, restructuring advisory partner at FRP, warns that many firms are still in a “perilous state of limbo”, despite the slowdown in insolvencies last month: “Insolvency levels appear to be stabilising, however many businesses still find themselves in a perilous state of limbo. Economic growth has stagnated after a positive couple of months while many investment decisions remain on pause as we await predicted interest rate cuts and the outcome of the general election – a particular risk in sectors like construction where purdah can stall planning decisions. In this environment, more will continue to falter, and we’re anticipating seeing the profile of those exposed shifting to larger companies – the impact of which will be felt keenly across supply chains. The future of many will be dependent on a stronger second half to the year, with greater economic and political certainty stimulating demand as well as falling input costs.” The number of UK individuals and businesses falling into insolvency has slowed, as pressures from rising costs ease. Official data shows that 9,266 individuals entered insolvency across England &amp; Wales in May, a 4% drop compared with April (but also 3% more than a year ago). The Insolvency Service reports there were 604 bankruptcies, 3,716 debt relief orders (DROs) and 4,946 individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs). DROs are available to those on low incomes, and will freeze, then wipe out, existing debts up to £30,000 on, for example, council tax, rent and energy bills. Their popularity has risen since a £90 fee was scrapped. Company insolvencies fell by 6% in May, month-on-month, in England and Wales to 2,006, which is 21% lower than in May 2023. Benjamin Wiles, managing director at Kroll, says the pace of insolvencies seems to be easing: “Compared to this time last year, we are seeing a pickup in business activity with key indicators showing improving consumer and business confidence. While I think it’s fair to say that we aren’t quite out of the woods, compared to twelve months ago when businesses were managing unpredictable cost inflation and energy bills, it does feel there’s now a lot more certainty for companies to plan. Interestingly, businesses we speak to are also coming to terms with higher borrowing costs – though there is evidence that some lenders are extending finance rather than restructuring debt. “Company administrations that we track are up year-on-year, but it does seem the pace of insolvencies are easing. There are some sectors including manufacturing and media and tech, which are continuing to see big increases, but overall it’s now a smaller trickle than a tidal wave.” Iceland’s chairman, Richard Walker, says Kantar are correct that the cost of living squeeze isn’t over – before squeezing in a plug for his supermarket: Back in January, Walker (a former Conservative supporter) announced he was backing Labour, saying Keir Starmer understood how the cost of living crisis has put an “unbearable strain” on families. The chair of Toyota has been re-elected despite opposition from two prominent shareholder advisors amid a scandal over vehicle testing and falsified emissions data. Akio Toyoda, grandson of the Japanese carmaker’s founder, is expected to have won a reduced share of votes at the annual shareholder meeting after ISS and Glass Lewis, two companies that recommend how investors should vote, advised a vote against him. The full results of the vote will not be known until Wednesday. The advisors’ governance concerns centre on Toyota’s Daihatsu subsidiary, which acknowledged problems with its crash safety testing last year. The company also admitted in 2022 that truckmaking subsidiary Hino falsified emissions data. The backing for Toyoda came after the company made strong profits. It has benefited from strong demand for hybrid electric cars, which combine a petrol engine with a battery. Some analysts are concerned that the company has been slower than rivals in Europe and particularly in China to adopt pure electric vehicle technology, but in the short term the hybrid strategy appears to have paid off in profits. The vote has also been closely watched by analysts who believe that Japan is starting a new era of more assertive shareholder activism, rather than a compliant investor base which was perceived as rarely challenging business leaders in the past. Guy Lawson-Johns, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, an investment platform, said: Most of the opposition to Toyoda is expected to have come from overseas investors, part of a broader wave of shareholder capitalism hitting Japan. Whitbread (who we covered in the introduction) are the top rise on the FTSE 100 share index in early trading. Whitbread’s shares have jumped by 4.5%, as investors welcome the news that UK trading strengthened over the last quarter. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says: Well, grocery price inflation is not what it used to be, but it’s still a surprise to see Kantar report that the supermarket sector saw only 1.0% sales growth in the latest 4 week period… Within the sector, Ocado was the fastest growing grocer for the fourth month in a row, increasing sales by 10.7% over the 12 weeks to 9 June. Tesco’s sales were up 4.6% over the last 12 weeks, taking its market share to 27.7% – the highest market share since February 2022, while Sainsbury’s market share rose to 15.2%. Discount retailer Lidl grew its market share to 8.1%, while rival Aldi has 10% of the market. Morrisons sales rose by 1.1%. giving a share of 8.7%, while Iceland’s sales rose 4.4%, giving it 2.4% of the market. Kantar reports that take-home grocery sales rose by just 1.0% over the four weeks to 9 June 2024, which is the the slowest increase since June 2022. That’s partly due to the slowdown in inflation (as prices rose at a slower rate), but also the poor weather in May and June. Kantar says the sixth wettest spring on record has hurt the grocery sector too, with much less demand for summer items such as suncream. Instead, we’ve been buying more soup! Kantar’s Fraser McKevitt explains: We’re not yet reaching for those typical summertime products and are making some purchases you wouldn’t expect in June. Consumers bought nearly 25% fewer suncare items this month compared with last year, while prepared salads dipped by 11%. On the other hand, warming fresh soup sales jumped by almost 24%. Kantar’s grocery inflation data will tee up tomorrow’s official UK inflation measure – due at 7am on Wednesday. City economists predict the UK consumer prices index could slow to 2%. That would mean inflation would, finally, be back to the Bank of England’s 2% target, for the first time since July 2021. Newsflash: UK grocery inflation has fallen for the 16th month in a row. Data firm Kantar reports that supermarket prices are 2.1% higher than a year ago this month, a slowdown on the 2.4% annual rise recorded in early May. Kantar reports that prices are now falling in nearly one third of the grocery categories it tracks, such as toilet tissues, butter and milk. This slowdown in price rises should bring some relief to households, who were hit by grocery inflation of 17% in March 2023. But Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, warns that the squeeze on budgets isn’t over. “The cost-of-living crisis isn’t over – far from it. 22% of households say they’re struggling, meaning that they aren’t able to cover their expenses or are just making ends meet. “However, there are positive signs that many of us no longer feel the need to restrict our spending quite so much, with lower inflation helping to ease the pressure on people’s pockets.” The Unite union has also supplied a report from an unnamed Whitbread worker, who says staff are worried about its plans for 1,500 job cuts. The anonymous Whitbread worker says: We are still only being drip fed information with little to no time to process or evaluate options. “The collective consultation process seems to have mostly dismissed any ideas put forward by our reps making everything look like it is just a tick box exercise to try and cover Whitbread against any legal backlash. “I feel I can speak for quite a few people when I say we’re all scared of what is coming. There are people out there not only losing their jobs but their homes too and there is little to no support from head office. We are now sat counting down the weeks wondering what will happen.” Whitbread also owns several restaurant chains, including Beefeater, Brewers Fayre and Bar + Block. It reports today that its total food and beverage sales (which fell 1% year-on-year) were boosted by strong breakfast sales driven by high occupancy at its hotels. However, that was offset by softer trading in “a number of our branded restaurants”, Whitbread says (a sign that cash-strapped customers are cutting back on eating out, perhaps?). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The hotel sector can be a good gauge of economic confidence, tracking whether people are splashing out for trips away and if firms are stumping up for business trips. And this morning, Premier Inn owner Whitbread has reported that recent trading in the UK has been “more encouraging”, as it prepares to face union anger over plans to cut 1,500 jobs. The company says it remains “confident in the full year outlook”, after growing total sales by 1% to £739m, “driven by improved UK trading and continued progress in Germany”. In its latest financial results, Whitbread reports that sales growth was flat (0%) in the UK for the 13 weeks to 30 May 2024, although it did grow by 15% in Germany (where trading had been weaker). That 0% figure, though, hides a pick-up after a weak start to the first quarter of Whitbread’s financial year. The company told shareholders: Having been 1% behind last year in the first seven weeks, our trading performance strengthened during the remainder of the quarter and accommodation sales recovered to be in line with last year and up 55% versus FY20. But, on a like-for-like basis, accommodation sales shrank by 2%, along with a 1% drop in food &amp; beverage sales. Whitbread reports that midweek business demand and peak leisure demand both remain “robust”, however last-minute demand for weekend stays has been “slightly softer”, particularly in London. Perhaps the post-pandemic surge in trips away has faded? Back in April, Whitbread reported strong results for the last financial year, including a 13% rise in sales in the year to 29 February. Whitbread also says net inflation is now expected to be at the lower end of its guidance as a result of “increased cost efficiencies”. The company, and its shareholders, will feel the wrath of the Unite union later today when they gather for its annual general meeting at its offices in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. Unite are planning a protest over Whitbread’s plans, announced in April, to cut 1,500 jobs. The union says Whitbread have refused to consult with them, or answer basic questions on the redundancy process. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Rarely is a company so shameless as to celebrate leaping profits and dividends by announcing mass job cuts. “But generating runaway profits while trampling workers is business as usual for Whitbread. This is a firm that refuses to pay the real living wage and does not even provide company sick pay for its underpaid and overworked staff. “Unite will be holding the company to account for its disgraceful race to the bottom behaviour and offering full support to our members impacted by these cruel and unnecessary redundancy plans.” The agenda 8am BST: Kantar’s grocery price inflation 10am BST: Eurozone inflation rate for May (final estimate) 10am BST: ZEW index of German economic sentiment 1pm BST: Unite protest ahead of Whitbread’s AGM 1.30pm BST: US retail sales for May 2.30pm BST: Whitbread’s AGM begins",

        "title": "As Wall Street pulls away from DEI, Goldman Sachs backs Black women: ‘Our commitment is strong’",
        "content": "At a time when conservative legal activists are targeting diversity measures in corporate America, Goldman Sachs has announced it is expanding a component of one of its philanthropic equity programs. The One Million Black Women initiative, a program the company started in 2021, aims to dedicate $10bn in investment and $100m in philanthropic spending to address racial and gender inequality over the course of 10 years. The firm said it has spent over $2.3bn in investment capital and another $33m towards philanthropic since the initiative launched. And this fall, Goldman is doubling the number of entrepreneurs it is accepting into its Black in Business no-cost education program, which is open to early-stage business owners with no employees and who have been running their business for at least a year. The program has had 750 participants across five cohorts over the last two years. The expansion comes as Wall Street has been publicly distancing itself from diversity initiatives as the conservative legal movement targets diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI. Last year, the American Alliance for Equal Rights – run by conservative legal strategist Edward Blum, who was behind the push to get the supreme court to overturn affirmative action – filed a lawsuit against Fearless Fund, a small venture capital firm that primarily funded companies run by women of color, for discrimination. Earlier this month, Trump-appointed judges on a Georgia-based federal appeals court ruled that a Fearless Fund diversity grant program for Black woman business owners is discriminatory. Lawyers for the fund said they are exploring options to fight the ruling. Asahi Pompey, Goldman Sachs’s global head of corporate engagement and the president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, said the company is “aware of what’s out there”. “And we are very focused on achieving the objectives of our program,” she said. “Of course we do that in operation and in compliance with laws, but our commitment to One Million Black Women is strong.” When One Million Black Women launched, the Covid-19 pandemic and the after-effects of the Black Lives Matter protests were sweeping the country. But Pompey said the company zeroed in on investment data that showed the economic case for investing in Black women. “Reducing the earnings gap for Black women has the potential to create 1.2 to 1.7m jobs in the US and increase annual US GDP by $300bn to $400bn,” Pompey said. “It says when Black women rise, America rises, because she’s creating jobs, she’s increasing revenue, she’s making her community better.” Investment and philanthropic capital is what is “needed in order to address the systemic issues that we know are out there”, Pompey added. Black in Business will take in an additional 300 entrepreneurs for the 10-week certification program, which will run later this year, bringing the total number of participants to 600 people. More than 600 participants have graduated from the program over the last two years. “Our data was showing that Black women are starting businesses faster than any other demographic in the United States,” said Pompey. “After three years in operation, 97% of those businesses failed.” The company flies participants to Goldman Sachs headquarters at the beginning and end of the program, where they can network with other participants and Goldman Sachs leaders. Though entrepreneurs in the Black in Business program do not receive a financial investment from Goldman Sachs, the company connects participants to a network of investors who are more willing to invest in smaller, early-stage companies. Goldman Sachs said 61% of participants reported an increase in revenue six months after finishing the program. Typically, only 33% of firms with no employees see revenue increases. Along with expanding the Black in Business program, Goldman Sachs also launched a public policy arm of the initiative aimed at sharing data about the barriers to economic mobility Black women face. In February, the company released survey data that showed Black women are more likely to have a part-time job in addition to working a full-time job, have student debt and use their income to help extended family. Even amid political and legal backlash on diversity programs that, years ago, companies were eager to promote, Pompey said the company is proud of its investment in Black women so far. “We’re creating a powerful community of individuals who are job creators, revenue generators, who are now more connected with each other,” Pompey said. “They come from 40 states, they’re across sectors. So I’m proud of that community that we’re building as well.”",

        "title": "Rail season ticket use in Great Britain falls to record low",
        "content": "The use of rail season tickets in Great Britain has plummeted to the lowest level on record, driven by a rise in working from home since the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of rail journeys made by people using season tickets fell to 13% in the year to 31 March, from 15% in the previous year, according to figures from the Office for Rail and Road, the industry regulator. This is the lowest figure since records started in 1986-87. Before the pandemic, in the year to March 2020, more than one-third (34%) of journeys were made using season tickets. Income from season tickets is a crucial component of railways’ revenue. During the pandemic, lockdowns forced office workers to work from home, with city centres resembling ghost towns. Since then, many employers have relaxed their rules to accommodate hybrid working, allowing people to continue to work partly from home. While some banks and other firms now insist on their employees spending most of their time in the office, a study showed this week that hybrid working makes employees happier, healthier and more productive. Three-quarters of those who work flexibly found they felt less burned out than when they spent their whole week in the office. The Office for Rail and Road said 1.6bn rail journeys were made in Britain last year, up by 16% on the 1.4bn journeys in the previous year. A total of 60bn km were travelled, up by 13% year-on-year. In the three months to March, passengers made 405m journeys, a 13% increase on the same quarter last year. Total passenger revenue rose to £10.3bn, a 13% increase on the £9.1bn in the previous year, when adjusted for inflation. In response to more people working part of their week at home, the rail industry started offering flexible season tickets that allow users to travel on any eight days in a 28-day period. However, analysis from MoneySavingExpert found part-time season tickets only offered savings to those travelling two days a week, and even then, there were often cheaper options. Govia Thameslink Railway was the largest operator by number of passenger journeys in the year to March. The Elizabeth line had the second-most journeys and had the greatest increase in journeys compared with the previous year, up 54%. This is due to an increase in services since opening the central section of the line in May 2022, with a full service starting in May 2023. The relatively large year-on-year increase in number of journeys for several operators was down to reduced timetables in the previous year. This includes ScotRail, Avanti West Coast and TransPennine Express, all of which ran reduced timetables at some point between April 2022 and March 2023.",

        "content": "Britons have cut back on their supermarket shopping and traditional summer purchases because of recent poor weather, even though grocery price inflation slowed further, according to a report. Supermarket prices were 2.1% higher than a year ago in the four weeks to 9 June, according to the retail researchers Kantar. This is down from May’s 2.4% inflation rate, and marks the 16th month that price rises have slowed. Kantar found costs are falling in nearly a third of the categories it tracks, including toilet tissue, butter and milk, an improvement from last year when just 1% of categories showed price declines. The monthly report comes before official UK inflation figures for May on Wednesday. Headline inflation is expected to fall from 2.3% in April to 2%, the government-set target level. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said that despite falling grocery inflation, “the cost of living crisis isn’t over – far from it”. He said 22% of households said they were struggling, unable to cover their expenses or just making ends meet. McKevitt added: “However, there are positive signs that many of us no longer feel the need to restrict our spending quite so much, with lower inflation helping to ease the pressure on people’s pockets.” Even though 36% of households described their financial position as comfortable – the highest proportion since November 2021 – sales rose by just 1% in June, the slowest increase since June 2022, Kantar said. Footfall also dipped. Wet weather meant shoppers bought nearly 25% fewer sun care items compared with last year, and 11% fewer prepared salads. At the same time, sales of fresh soup jumped by almost 24%. McKevitt said: “The sixth wettest spring on record hasn’t just dampened our spirits leading into summer, it’s made a mark on the grocery sector too as it seems Britons are being put off from popping to the shops. “We’re not yet reaching for those typical summertime products and are making some purchases you wouldn’t expect in June.” Supermarkets and pubs are hoping for good performances from England and Scotland at the Euro 2024 tournament to boost spending, with the proportion of beer and lager promotions leaping to more than 40% in the last four weeks. “Retailers will be competing with fans heading out of the house to watch the football as well as with each other,” said McKevitt. “Pubs especially could benefit from a boost – whether or not football comes home. Throughout the last tournament held in 2021, sales of food and non-alcoholic drinks in pubs soared by 60% compared with the average month that year.” Tesco cemented its position as Britain’s biggest supermarket, with a market share of 27.7%, after sales rose 4.6% in the three months to 9 June compared with a year earlier. Sales rose at all of the big supermarkets over the period, apart from Asda, down by 4%, and Co-op, down by 2.3%. Ocado was the fastest-growing grocer for the fourth month in a row, increasing sales by 10.7% over the 12 weeks to 9 June. Almost a quarter of British households (23%) did their grocery shopping online in the last three months, with more than 4% choosing to use Ocado. Discounter Aldi, the fourth-largest retailer by consumer spend, boosted sales by 0.8%. It now has a share of 10%.",

        "title": "BYD: China’s electric vehicle powerhouse charges into Europe",
        "content": "Germany’s men kicked off Euro 2024 on Friday in Munich. The city is storied in football terms, but it also occupies an important place in Germany’s self-image for a different reason: Munich is home to BMW, one of the country’s car exporting powerhouses. Yet it will not be the logos of BMW or German rivals including Volkswagen or Mercedes-Benz plastered on stadiums or television coverage. Instead, China’s BYD is the only carmaker to sponsor Europe’s premier international tournament. Auto Trader said the advertising campaign was responsible for a 69% week-on-week increase in views of BYD models on its website, during the first weekend of the tournament from Friday to Sunday. BYD is vying with Elon Musk’s Tesla as the world’s largest electric carmaker, and Europe is its key export target. But BYD is facing its own Euro drama, as the EU threatens to impose tariffs on its products. The EU highlighted alleged unfair subsidies for the trio of BYD, Geely and the state-owned SAIC Motor. If confirmed after negotiations with China, BYD will face tariffs of 17.4%, in an effort to protect the European car industry and its 3 million workers. Yet many experts believe tariffs alone will not be enough to slow the march of BYD on Europe’s car market. For BYD’s founder, tariffs by the US and the EU are a sign of the newfound strength of China’s car industry. Wang Chuanfu– often described as China’s Elon Musk – last week reportedly told an audience of car executives at an industry conference in Chongqing: “If you are not strong enough, they will not be afraid of you.” Wang studied metallurgy in Hunan province, before founding BYD as a battery company in 1995. He gained Motorola and Nokia as customers, before snapping up a bankrupt car factory in 2003 to produce hybrids (vehicles that combine a battery with a petrol engine). Since then Wang has built BYD into the world’s second-largest battery maker, behind only Chinese rival CATL, and the world’s second-largest maker of electric cars, after briefly overtaking Tesla at the end of 2023. Subsidies and tariffs BYD faces a lower tariff rate than other Chinese carmakers, such as Geely’s 20% or SAIC’s 38.1%. It is thought this was partly because of its cooperation with the EU, but also because the analysis suggested it benefited less from subsidies than rivals. That would be a surprise, as previous estimates of Chinese subsidies by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy suggested BYD “receives particularly high subsidies”, including €2bn (£1.7bn) in 2022 alone, according to public filings. BYD has also benefited heavily from China’s generous electric car grants. Whatever the exact level of support, the company’s headquarters at Pingshan, on the outskirts of Shenzhen, rivals Volkswagen’s Wolfsburg in size. Gregor Sebastian, an analyst covering Chinese industry at the consultancy Rhodium Group, said aid from the city government had also played an important role in BYD’s development. The cars BYD produces in Pingshan are not particularly remarkable. But that is a big change from Chinese petrol or diesel cars, which often had a reputation for feeling cheap. By contrast, at an industry test day last month, cars from BYD and its Chinese rivals Omoda, Ora and MG (owned by SAIC) were not out of place alongside German and Korean marques. BYD’s entry-level Dolphin and its more premium Seal offer features as standard that might cost extra from rivals. Even a rotating central screen felt sturdy when this reporter ill-advisedly tugged at it rather than pressing the button to rotate. Notably, increasingly crucial digital features such as voice assistants appear better executed than much more expensive European competition. Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based electric vehicle (EV) analyst, said BYD sold fewer than 10,000 cars in western Europe in the first four months of 2024. However, he added that BYD may have started with “ambitious pricing, presumably designed to soak up any rise in European tariff increases”. The cheapest version of a Dolphin will start at £25,490, less than a VW ID.3.. Yet a version of the Dolphin sells for 99,800 yuan (£10,700) in China. Even accounting for extra costs because of stricter UK and European regulation, that implies a lot of leeway to absorb tariffs. A planned car factory in Hungary could export to the EU tariff-free, and an executive last week said BYD was committed to building a second. “The whole business of tariffs isn’t going to hole China automotive below the waterline,” said Rupert Mitchell, who worked for years in the Chinese car industry for the now bankrupt startup WM Motor. Mitchell, who now runs the Blind Squirrel Macro blog, said: “We definitely felt that we had a cost advantage versus the rest of the world.” BYD’s electric ambitions are not limited to cars. It has already built up a strong position in the electric bus market, including in the UK where the Canadian-owned bus maker Alexander Dennis builds the bodies for buses running on BYD chassis. Despite its courting of bus-buying local authorities, the company still appears to want to control its public image closely. BYD last month invited UK journalists to view its newest electric bus, only to rescind the same invitation at short notice – apparently discomfited by the prospect of newspapers asking questions. The company blamed an unspecified “misunderstanding” between the company and the external public relations agencies that handled the invitations. The event went ahead with specialist media. Battery dominance BYD’s roots as a battery maker appear to have given it an important manufacturing advantage. Rhodium’s Sebastian said vertical integration – owning the supply chain rather than buying parts from elsewhere – had given it “a lot of control over costs”. Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy, highlighted its ownership of computer chip factories as well as its batteries. And “they have scale”, he added, predicting 4m car sales this year – about half pure electric and half hybrid. “There is no one close to building as many clean energy vehicles as BYD.” And where other carmakers have focused on long-range batteries containing expensive nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC), BYD has pioneered the use of the cheaper lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry. Al Bedwell, the director of global powertrain at LMC Automotive, said BYD had “invested in [LFP] heavily and optimised it to the point that it can compete”, including through designs that minimise the packaging around battery cells. So far the company has proven itself vital to the global transition away from petrol and diesel cars – including in poorer but fast-growing countries such as Brazil and Indonesia, where BYD is opening plants. “You wouldn’t have so much success [in the global transition] without BYD,” said Sebastian. “The only other company that is like that is Tesla. Only they are driving the EV transition at scale.”",

It is mostly a case of investors having a wobble over French assets, especially the banks, after Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call snap legislative elections. The related fall in the euro against sterling plays to the same theme. Fourth, who cares anyway? Relative size versus Paris is a diverting yardstick, but success for London should really be measured in terms of quality of new listings, capital raised, the ease of doing business and so forth. The fascination with pure size quickly leads to the current silly idea that it would somehow be a “boost” for London if Shein, the Chinese-founded, but Singapore-based, fast-fashion retailer could be persuaded to list here, carrying a supposed £52bn valuation. Come on – the only reason Shein would choose London is because its application to join the US market has been stuck since last November amid controversy over alleged labour malpractices. A willingness to take New York’s castoffs, whatever their size, is not obviously a way to restore the lustre of London. Quite the reverse. What would count as success? Well, here’s a small example from another weekend story: the founders of Melrose Industries, the deal-making company that bought the aerospace and automotive group GKN for £8bn in a hostile takeover in 2018, will return to action with a London-listed investment vehicle. Rosebank Industries – a sort of Melrose 2.0 – will raise £40m-plus via an offering on Aim, London’s junior market, Sky News reported, before hunting for deals of up to $3bn and then moving up to the main market. It’s perhaps not a surprise that Simon Peckham, who bowed out as chief executive of Melrose earlier this year, is sticking to London rather than being tempted by, say, the US. The UK is where he and his colleagues made their names and enriched investors (and themselves, spectacularly). But the alternative was probably to pursue their private equity-style model of “buy, improve, sell” away from the public markets altogether. Given their record, it would have been a simple matter to raise a few quid from the vast pools of capital sloshing around in private markets. Adopting a quoted vehicle is therefore a welcome vote of confidence in the public arena, whatever critics say, who persist in mischaracterising Melrose as “robber baron” capitalism (it really isn’t: GKN was genuinely improved with investment). The London stock market would be a livelier place if there were more like it. Shein, on the other hand, we can live without.",

        "title": "Likely ‘a bird strike’: Virgin Australia flight makes emergency landing in New Zealand after engine fire",
        "content": "A suspected bird strike has caused a Virgin Australia plane to make an emergency landing in New Zealand after one of its engines caught fire shortly after takeoff. The Melbourne-bound flight left Queenstown on Monday evening with footage emerging later that appeared to show fire coming from the Boeing 737-800. Flight tracking websites show that immediately after taking off the plane headed south from Queenstown – rather than west to Melbourne as was scheduled. It performed a holding pattern while flying over the South Island before landing at the airport in Invercargill, about 150km south of Queenstown. The Boeing 737-800 jet was carrying 67 passengers and six crew. It landed safely about 50 minutes after leaving Queenstown and was met by fire trucks on the tarmac. “At this time, we are not aware of any physical injuries to guests or crew,” Virgin Australia’s chief operations officer, Stuart Aggs, said. Passengers said they saw flames coming from one of the engines and heard loud bangs, the New Zealand Herald reported. Michael Hayward said it was completely dark outside when the plane took off at 6pm local time. “Within 10 seconds of going airborne, you hear just the loudest ‘bang’, golden lights filling within the cabin and a burst of flames off the right-hand engine,” he told ABC radio. Hayward said he was quite anxious as were the other passengers – with a few cries in the cabin as people realised something had gone wrong. “I could see flames shooting out of [the engine] at regular intervals,” he said, adding the captain later informed passengers the plane had hit a flock of birds. “There was an initial worry but it wasn’t long until people realised OK, it’s under control, so just sit back, relax and whatever happens happens.” Queenstown airport’s chief executive, Glen Sowry, said on Tuesday that a bird caught in the engine was the most likely cause of the incident. “At this stage, we believe that it’s highly probable that it was a bird strike, but until such time as the engine has been inspected by engineers in Invercargill we won’t be able to confirm that for sure,” Sowry told RNZ. Bird strikes were a known risk but incidents were infrequent, the CEO said. The airport took regular risk-management measures, including keeping the grass short and not allowing standing water nearby. “If you get a bigger bird that is ingested into an engine, which looks probably what may have occurred on this occasion, then – depending on where in the engine it goes – it can damage critical parts.” The runway had been inspected two minutes before the plane took off and no bird activity had been recorded, Sowry said. Aircraft are designed to be able to operate and land using one engine. The Virgin Australia flight most likely took a pre-determined safe route, designed for instances of engine failure, to avoid nearby mountains, Sowry said on Tuesday. Queenstown airport released a statement confirming the flight “experienced an issue just after takeoff” and was diverted to Invercargill. Passengers were given accommodation in Invercargill overnight and were then transported back to Queenstown airport where they were expected to be booked on alternative flights to Australia on Tuesday. The rate of birds striking planes at New Zealand’s airports is about four in every 10,000 aircraft movements, the country’s aviation regulator says on its website. – Additional reporting Australian Associated Press",

        "title": "Investment in UK has trailed other G7 countries since mid-1990s, IPPR says",
        "content": "Investment in the UK has trailed other G7 countries including the US and Germany since the mid-1990s, according to a report that urges Labour and the Conservatives to reverse planned cuts to investment or risk long-term damage to economic growth. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank found the UK was bottom of the G7 league for investment in 24 out of the last 30 years, using figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A lack of spending by UK companies on technology and innovation over the last three decades was mostly to blame for the underperformance, the OECD figures show, while public sector investment has also ranked below the G7 average. The IPPR said latest comparable data for 2022 showed investment by private companies was lower in the UK than any other G7 country for the third year in a row. The analysis also showed the UK ranked 28th for business investment out of 31 OECD countries with Slovenia, Latvia and Hungary attracting higher levels in relation to the size of their economies. Private investment includes spending in factories, plant and equipment, and technology. The G7 comprises the UK, US, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada, while the OECD has 38 member countries. A lack of investment is widely blamed for the UK’s poor productivity record and low levels of economic growth. A report last year by the National Infrastructure Commission said investments of about £30bn a year from UK taxpayers, and £40bn to £50bn a year from the private sector, would result in savings to the average household of at least £1,000 a year, higher economic productivity, and a better quality of life in the future. The IPPR report said: “The different trajectories of France, with the second-highest level of private investment in the G7, and the UK show that the UK’s poor performance was far from inevitable. “In 2005, the two countries had the same level of business investment – about 11.35% of GDP. In the most recent data (2022), France increased its level by 3.4 percentage points, while the UK’s now stands almost 1 percentage point lower.” Among OECD countries, only Greece, Luxembourg and Poland were ranked lower for business investment than the UK over the last three years. The thinktank said it was concerned cuts to public investment were forecast whichever of the two main parties wins the general election, though Labour plans to reduce budgets by less than the Conservatives. “Current Conservative policies imply significant cuts to public investment after the election. Even though Labour promises to invest £4.7bn more per year than the current government through its green prosperity plan, this still implies an overall fall in investment.” The figures show the turning point was the period after the early 1990s recession, which was followed by a severe property crash and Black Wednesday, when Britain was forced to hurriedly exit from the EU’s exchange rate mechanism. Ever since, growth in private sector investment has tracked below all the G7 countries except in three of the 24 years. The IPPR said the next UK government should “lead from the front by designing and delivering high-quality public investments to crowd in private sector funds, especially into industries of the future like electric vehicles and renewable energy”. It added: “Likewise public sector investments in education, infrastructure and healthcare are needed to create the right conditions for growth.”",

        "title": "McDonald’s ends AI drive-thru trial as fast-food industry tests automation",
        "content": "McDonald’s is ending its test of employing artificial intelligence chatbots at drive-thrus, raising questions over the fast food industry’s rush to roll out the technology. The world’s largest burger chain will remove automated AI-based order systems from over 100 locations around the US. The systems, which featured an AI voice responding to customer orders, had been tested as part of a deal between McDonald’s and IBM that began in 2021. McDonald’s gave no public reason for ending its test run, according to Restaurant Business, telling franchises that it would shut down the technology on 26 July. A spokesperson for McDonald’s told the publication that it would decide its plans for automated orders by the end of the year, but stressed that “a voice-ordering solution for drive-thru will be part of our restaurants’ future”. Fast-food chains have taken an immense interest in integrating generative AI into their systems in recent years. Along with McDonald’s, a range of other companies including Wendy’s, Hardee’s, Carl’s Jr, and Del Taco all use AI technology at their drive-thrus. Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell and KFC, announced earlier this year that it was instituting an “AI-first mentality” in its fast-food restaurants. The fast-food industry’s growing affinity for AI comes as companies see the technology as a means of replacing human workers to reduce rising labor costs. After California passed a new mandatory minimum wage law for fast-food workers, businesses rushed towards implementing AI technologies that could perform tasks such as taking customer orders. While companies have touted AI as the future of the fast-food industry, these technologies have also resulted in viral videos and media coverage documenting when they get orders wrong. McDonald’s drive-thru AI failures circulated on TikTok last year after several videos purported to show the system adding erroneous items like butter packets or multiplying how many items were ordered. Another video showed two women uncontrollably laughing and calling out for the system to stop adding items to their order as it appeared to put hundreds of dollars worth of McNuggets on their tab. While automated systems have faced backlash for misunderstanding customer orders, some have also come under scrutiny for relying on outsourced human labor to make them run. The company Presto Automation Inc, which provides AI services for fast-food chains, revealed in an SEC filing last year that it employs workers in countries including the Philippines to get involved in customer interactions about 70% of the time. In addition to drive-thru orders, some companies have started to explore how generative AI could be used to develop digital chatbots on their apps or utilize image-recognition to determine wait times. McDonald’s struck a deal with Google in December of last year to create a chatbot called “Ask Pickles” that would be able to train employees on issues such as how to clean restaurant equipment. The companies also agreed to work on other potential uses for generative AI, according to Bloomberg.",

        "title": "Paris loses spot as Europe’s largest equity market to London",
        "content": "Paris has lost its position as Europe’s largest equity market to London, as investors reacted to political turmoil in France in the week since Emmanuel Macron called snap elections. Stocks listed on Euronext Paris were collectively worth about $3.13tn after about $258bn was knocked off the market capitalisation of French companies last week, putting it behind the London Stock Exchange’s $3.18tn (£2.51tn), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Separate data from the London Stock Exchange Group also suggested the market value of UK-listed companies was bigger. Macron’s decision to call national assembly elections took most French political analysts by surprise, after a poor showing by his Renaissance party in the European parliamentary elections. Polls suggest the far-right National Rally (RN), led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, could become the largest party in the assembly, an outcome that would hobble the remaining three years of Macron’s presidency, as well as breaking a longstanding taboo against extremist parties. RN’s “platform of unfunded public spending” is one reason why financial markets have been unsettled, wrote analysts from the investment bank UBS in a note to clients. “The probability of no clear majority emerging is high, leading to potential political instability.” The UK’s main stock exchange lost its crown to its French rival in 2022 when British politics was seen as more unpredictable. That occurred within a month of Liz Truss resigning as prime minister, after her government’s promise of unfunded tax cuts triggered market turmoil. Investors now perceive lower uncertainty in the UK, despite its own general election on 4 July. Most polls indicate a strong Labour majority is likely, which has reduced uncertainty. The euro has also weakened against the pound since Macron announced the elections. Sterling rose from €1.1772 on 7 June, the Friday before the EU election results, to hit €1.19 last Friday. As Paris’s stock market is valued in euros, while London stocks are priced in pounds, this currency effect bolsters the market capitalisation of UK stocks. France’s banks were hit by last week’s sell-off of French assets. Shares in Société Générale and BNP Paribas have both fallen about 7%. France’s benchmark CAC 40 share index also suffered its biggest weekly fall since 2022. The French turmoil has also been reflected in bond markets. The gap between French and German borrowing costs widened to the most in seven years. That spread tends to widen when investors consider French debt to be riskier than Germany’s. The largest individual stocks can also have an effect. The value of Paris’s stock market has been inflated by the luxury goods maker LVMH, which in 2023 became the first European company to hit a $500bn valuation. Shares in the owner of brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Tiffany are down 9% in the past month. Data supplied by the LSEG showed that the London Stock Exchange’s total market capitalisation is £5tn, nearly £2.2tn more than the next largest European venue, Paris, at £2.81tn. London was also ahead of Paris if share listings alone were considered, but marginally behind Paris if this was restricted to domestic issuers, the LSEG added.",

        "title": "Spanish drivers hired to deliver Amazon parcels in UK take legal action over pay",
        "content": "A group of drivers hired in Spain and brought to the UK to deliver Amazon packages to British households in the run-up to Christmas are taking legal action against the company and one of its subcontractors. The drivers claim the subcontractor promised them earnings of more than £100 a day, free housing, van rental, insurance and free return flights via an online meeting in Spanish. Once they arrived in the UK, the workers received four days of training at Amazon facilities, but within a few weeks of beginning work not all the money they claim was promised had arrived. Some of the drivers say they were not paid in full, and in some cases billed thousands of pounds for vehicle damage after their contracts ended, leaving several in debt. While they accept there was vehicle damage, they believe the fees charged to be exorbitant. The drivers are now taking legal action against the subcontractor, One Motion, for the docked wages and compensation in a group tribunal claim. They say in their claim that consent for the charges was not “validly obtained”, as the terms and conditions for the subcontractor agreement were told to the drivers after they had signed. Amazon is named as a respondent in the claim. The drivers are being supported by the United Voices of the World (UVW) union in the claim. A spokesperson for UVW said the deductions were exorbitant and that nearly all workers in the claim “experienced this deduction strategy”. The spokesperson added: “One Motion continues to send debt collection agencies to hound these workers to pay these erroneous debts, threatening their credit scores and financial wellbeing.” One Motion said: “Each driver named by United Voices of the World received remuneration of at least £100 per day for each day on which services were provided after any relevant deductions were applied for vehicle rental charges and/or accommodation costs.” One of the drivers on the claim, José Manuel Elá Asángono, said not only did One Motion not pay him in full but it now said he owed it money. “After working for five weeks for them, they only paid me £200 out of the agreed £3,100 and they are saying I owe them £5,500,” he said. “I just want us to be paid back the money we are owed and for this not to happen to anyone else.” Diego Martin Baglietto says he noticed he had received only £450 by the 25th day he had worked after being told pay would be weekly. Baglietto and five other drivers shared accommodation with a man known only as Wilson, according to the claim. The drivers claim that because of an incident when Wilson was unable to move his van and was told he had to pay for recovery, another driver, José María Moreno López, asked One Motion management to see the vehicle insurance policy. López was then told to leave the accommodation and England, while the others, according to the claim, continued working for fear of losing their accommodation, going home with docked wages and without a return flight to Spain. UVW claims the events are an automatic confirmation of unfair dismissal. The drivers said they were registered as self-employed, paid weekly and told they would only need to take care of their own food. UVW contends that the drivers were classified as subcontractors operating on a self-employed basis, but because of the nature of their relationship with One Motion they should have been classed as workers, according to the Employment Rights Act 1996. The union say One Motion delayed the drivers’ pay, with large sums left unpaid, and once the workers were sent back to Spain they were charged for van rental, minor damage to the vans and cleaning of their lodgings, as well as administrative fees – described as excessive by the union – to process driving fines. One Motion denies the allegations, saying their position was that the drivers were correctly classified as subcontractors operating on a self-employed basis. A spokesperson said: “Where the net amount paid to the driver differed to the gross as a result of damage caused to a vehicle and/or fines or penalty notices issued these costs were clearly communicated to each driver and all have also now been communicated to UVW, including a detailed third-party report providing a costing of any damage caused to a vehicle. “Of the 14 drivers represented by UVW, three incurred no additional charges relating to damages to a vehicle owing to the fact that vehicles were returned in the same condition as which they had been issued. “The remaining 11 were engaged for a period of between four and six weeks and a total of £22,053 of damage was caused to the vehicles issued. The majority of these vehicles were supplied to us by third parties and returned to those third-party suppliers shortly after Christmas. This means that we, as a business, directly incurred these costs/losses for the damage caused by the drivers responsible for these vehicles.” Amazon denied it was involved in any wrongdoing and said it was committed to fair treatment for those employed by its subcontractors. “We are committed to ensuring that the people contracted by our independent delivery providers are fairly compensated and treated with respect. We have been made aware of the issue and are investigating,” it said. Amazon made almost £27bn in delivery sales in the UK alone, and One Motion Logistics Ltd reported £90m revenue across operations in the UK, Spain and Germany.",

        "content": "House prices in China slumped at the fastest rate in almost 10 years in May as a glut of properties on the market hit demand, despite renewed efforts by the government to prop up the sector. The price of new homes in 70 cities, excluding subsidised housing, fell by 0.7% from April. This was the steepest drop since October 2014, according to National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) figures posted on Monday. Values of existing homes fell by 1%, the steepest drop since China started using its current data collection method in 2011. The disappointing data comes despite the most ambitious attempt yet by the government to revive house prices in China. In May, the People’s Bank of China scrapped the minimum rate of interest and reduced down-payment ratios to 15% for first-time buyers and 25% for second homes. It also created a 300bn yuan (£32.8bn) facility to support local state-owned companies to buy homes at reasonable prices. Investors say the amount the central bank has invested may not be enough. Measures in several cities allowing local governments to buy up excess properties from developers have made slow progress in deploying allocated funds. The oversupply of homes on the market has hit prices, making people less likely to invest. Prices also declined from a year earlier. New house prices dropped 3.9%, according to Reuters. Liu Aihua, a spokesperson for the NBS, told a media briefing on Monday that the property market was undergoing adjustment and it would take some time for policy measures to kick in. Policymakers have been attempting to rein in the oversupply of housing, and support debt-laden developers since the market went into freefall in 2020, hit by the pandemic and a sudden regulatory crackdown on indebted lenders. China’s ailing property market reflects struggles in the wider economy. Industrial output grew more slowly in May at 5.6% compared with 6.7% a year earlier. Economists were expecting growth of about 6%. Retail sales beat expectations in May, however, climbing 3.7%. This was better than analyst expectations of 3% growth. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said gloomy economic data could prompt the Bank of China to cut interest rates to help demand. “The latest data showed that home prices there slid at a faster pace in May despite all the efforts that the Chinese government puts in to stop the bleeding, and industrial production slowed significantly more than expected, as well, during the same month,” she added. “The People’s Bank of China is expected to maintain its rates unchanged this week, but some economists at Bloomberg believe that the week could bring a 10 basis point cut in China to prop things up.”",

        "content": "Time to recap…. Governments faced with economic upheaval caused by artificial intelligence should consider fiscal policies including taxes on excess profits and a green levy to atone for AI-related carbon emissions, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF said unlike previous technological breakthroughs such as the steam engine, generative AI – the term for computer systems such as ChatGPT that can produce convincing, human-like text, voices and images from simple hand-typed prompts – can spread “much faster” and advances in the technology are happening at “breakneck speed”. The international lender of last resort said governments should consider a range of policies to mitigate the impact on jobs, including a carbon tax to account for the environmental impact of operating the computer servers that train and operate AI systems. The value of risky debt issued by French lenders has fallen further today, Reuters has spotted, as investors fret about political uncertainty. An AT1 bonds issued by Societe Generale dropped to its lowest price since December, Tradeweb data showed, while equivalent debt from BNP Paribas also weakened. These AT1 bonds, also known as “contingent convertibles” or “CoCo” bonds - can be converted into equity if a bank hits trouble. Effectively, they are shock absorbers if a bank’s capital levels fall below a certain threshold. Just in: Activity at factories in the state of New York has weakened, for the seventh month running. June’s Empire State Manufacturing Survey, just released, shows the sector contracted again this month The headline general business conditions index moved up ten points but remained below zero at -6.0. Firms also reported that new orders held steady, delivery times shortened somewhat, and supply availability was little changed. Employment levels and hours worked continuing to contract, suggesting weak demand for workers…. but optimism about the six-month outlook picked up to its highest level in more than two years. Citigroup has downgraded its rating on European stocks, citing risks from France’s politicial turmoil, Bloomberg reports. Citi analysts have cut their view on European shares to neutral from overweight on “heightened political risks”, among other factors. Instead, they favour growth-oriented US stocks, which are upgraded to overweight from neutral. They say: “We upgrade the US due to its substantially higher growth tilt relative to Europe, and more defensive nature in episodes of uncertainty. Political uncertainty could cool US investors’ recent rotation into European equities for the time being.” London remains the most productive region of the UK, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics, but the gap is narrowing. The ONS reports that the capital had the highest productivity level of any UK region in 2022, with an output per hour 26.2% higher than the UK average. The South East was also ahead of the national average, by 10.8%, but the rest of the country lagged on an output per hour basis. However, London made the largest negative contribution to UK growth in output per hour by region, compared with 2019. The ONS explains: UK output per hour worked has grown at a cumulative average annual rate of 0.8% from 2019 to 2022. The North West experienced growth of 2.6% annually, which is the largest of any region, and London the largest fall of any region, at 0.9%. China’s decision to launch a probe into pork anti-dumping isn’t a shock, says Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “It will not be the first time that a probe announced in one jurisdiction is responded to in kind, so in view of the EU electric vehicles probe, this is not a surprise.” “Free and open markets rely on rules-based trade practices,” A spokesperson for the European Commission said the bloc was not worried about China opening its investigation and told reporters the EU would intervene appropriately to ensure the investigation complied with all relevant World Trade Organisation rules. The copper price has slipped to an eight-week low, following this morning’s generally weak economic data from China. China is a major consumer of copper, so the slowdown in industrial production last month (growth slowed to 5.6% in May, from 6.7% in April) could hint at weaker demand. The ongoing slump in China’s housing market could also be a factor hitting copper, which fell around 1% on the London Metal Exchange to $9,631 a metric ton, the lowest since April 23. That early rally in European stock markets didn’t last. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has now dropped by 0.3% today, hitting its lowest level in six weeks. Spain’s IBEX share index is leading the selloff, down 0.7%, while Italy’s FTSE MIB has lost 0.2% and the French CAC 40 is down 0.1%. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: Some of the risk-off sentiment which spread sparked by worries about the far-right gaining legislative power in France has eased off. Although the European Central Bank does not look like it’ll be easily propelled into buying French government debt, hopes have risen slightly that spending pledged by the National Rally party would in practice be curtailed in a hung parliament scenario. The pound has dipped this morning, as traders await the Bank of England’s interest rates decision on Thursday. The BoE is widely expected to leave interest rates on hold at 5.25%, and the City will be looking for any signals as to when it might start to lower borrowing costs. Steve Matthews, investment directo for liquidity at Canada Life Asset Management, predicts the BoE coud cut rates in August, saying: “Looking ahead to Thursday’s Bank of England interest rate decision, we expect a 7-2 vote in favour of no cut. Despite recent data supporting a cut - such as the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% and expectations that the CPI will hit 2% on Wednesday - concerns about upcoming wage data and services inflation persist. “While the European Central Bank made a move last week, the Federal Reserve is taking a more cautious approach. This gives the Bank of England additional opportunity to make a well-timed decision. “Although there is light at the end of the tunnel, we are still firmly in the tunnel. We maintain our view that a first cut of 25bps in August is still the most likely scenario.” The pound has lost 0.15% against the US dollar this morning, to $1.266, and to €1.1822 against the euro. Official campaigning for the French elections began at midnight today, ahead of the first round of voting on 30 June. A frenetic fortnight of activity is expected, after the deadline for candidates to register for the 577 seats in the lower house expired yesterday evening. Kylian Mbappé, captain of the men’s French football team, has urged young people to vote in the election, and to resist extremism. Mbappé said: “This is a never-seen-before event. And that is why I want to talk to the whole of the French people, but also the youth. We are a generation that can make a difference. We see the extremes are knocking on the door of power and we have the opportunity to shape our country’s future.” China has retaliated against Europe’s new curbs on its electric cars, by opening an anti-dumping investigation into imported pork and its by-products from the European Union. China is the EU’s biggest overseas market for pork, which was worth over $1.8bn last year according to Bloomberg, led by shipments from Spain, Denmark and the Netherlands. China’s Ministry of Commerce said the investigation has been launched in response to an application submitted by the China Animal Agriculture Association. It will examine the import of pork and pig by-products from the EU during 2023, and look into whether any damage was done to related Chinese industries. News agency Xinhua says the probe is expected to end before 17 June 2025, but may be extended for half a year under special circumstances. Beijing’s move comes a few days after the EU notified Beijing that it intends to impose tariffs of up to 38% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles. Analysts have warned that pork supply chains in Europe would be heavily disrupted if exports to China were suspended, leaving farmers with unwanted stock. The European Central Bank’s chief economist has attempted to pay down concerns over the turmoil in the eurozone’s bond markets. Philip Lane told a Reuters NEXT Newsmaker interview that the bond markets are not disorderly, a signal that the ECB is not planning to intervene to calm nerves over the upcoming French election. As Lane put it: “What we are seeing in the markets is a repricing but it is not in the world of disorderly markets right now.” He added that the ECB must make clear that it will not tolerate unwarranted or disorderly market dynamics. This morning, the yield (or interest rate) on French and German bonds have both risen slightly, as prices have dipped, but not at rates that could be called disorderly. When asked about the situation in France, Lane says all governments must show how they will implement new fiscal frameworks. Debt-ridden Warrington Borough Council has lost its credit rating with Moody’s, just as the government investigates whether it is meeting its obligations. Warrington, which had estimated debts of £1.8bn, told investors this morning that Moody’s withdrew its credit rating on Friday. This is due to “the inability of the Council to procure that its statements of accounts are audited by external auditors for historical financial years,” Warrington admits. The council is now seeking a rating from another agency for £150m of bonds which mature in 2055, and says it remains compliant with the terms of these bonds. Moody’s move comes a month after the Financial Times reported that Warrington Borough Council had refused to hand key information to its auditor, Grant Thornton. Like many UK councils, Warrington has ploughed cash into commercial schemes in the hope of generating returns. That included a stake in Together Energy, which fell into administration in 2022, and a £200m loan facility to Matthew Moulding, billionaire owner of the Hut Group. At the start of May, the government appointed an inspector to undertake an independent inspection of Warrington Borough Council, to see if it is meeting its Best Value Duty (to continuously improved the way its functions are exercised). The chief executive of the council, Steven Broomhead, insisted this month that the £1.8bn of debt was actually an investment. Broomhead declared: “A lot of what we’ve done in Warrington has been what I call ‘civic entrepreneurism’. We’ve been very commercial in the way we’ve operated. We’ve been so commercial that we’ve attracted the attention of government who are carrying out a best value inspection in what we’ve been doing.” We haven’t been borrowing money to invest for a return. We’ve been borrowing money for regeneration. What the hell is wrong with that?” Last week’s turmoil in the French stock market has resulted in Paris losing its crown as Europe’s biggest equity market to the UK (who it snatched it from two years ago). Bloomberg reports that stocks in France are now collectively worth about $3.13trn, narrowly losing out to the UK at $3.18trn. This reversal came after around $258bn was wiped off the French market last week, when shares in French banks fell sharply. Britain’s stock market lost its position as Europe’s most-valued to France in late 2022, a decline that was blamed on the weak pound, UK recession fears, and a surge in the value of French luxury goods maker LVMH. Bloomberg’s data, though, only covers actively traded, primary securities on the two country’s exchanges. If you include other securities, such as ETFs and ADRs, London was already bigger…. European stock markets have opened a little higher. In Paris, the CAC 40 share index has gained 0.5%, recovering just a little of last week’s 6% tumble. Germany’s DAX is 0.4% higher, while the UK’s FTSE 100 is up 0.23%. The UK housing market remained flat this month, new data from Rightmove shows. Average asking prices were unchanged month-on-month in June, with prices strengthening in less expensive regions while lagging behind in the pricier East of England and in London. Rightmove reports a “slight drop” in new sellers, particularly at the high-end of the market, which may be a sign of caution ahead of the UK general election next month. Over the last four weeks, the number of sales being agreed has stayed steady at 6% higher than a year ago. Ian Preston, group CEO at estate agent Preston Baker in Leeds, reports that the general election hasn’t made an appreciable difference to market conditions, adding: Whichever government is chosen, the priority must be increasing the supply of new homes. Investment in the local authority planning system, to speed up applications, is the priority. The last two or three weeks have been seismic in terms of election results, points out Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank, telling clients: South Africa, Mexico, India and Europe have seen varying degrees of fallout as a result. However, as we know by now it’s the French market currently in the eye of the storm with the rest of Europe being sucked into the vortex. Reid warns that the uncertainty in France will be with us until at least the second round of the election on July 7th and likely beyond. The polls haven’t narrowed in Macron’s favour in the first week of the campaign with the far right and left outpacing the President’s centrist party. He warns that the spread between German and French borrowing costs (measured by the interest rates on their respective 10-year bonds) could widen further: The reason this is important is that last week the Franco-German 10yr spread rose +28.6bps over the week (and +6.9bps on Friday). This brings it to its highest level since November 2012, and its largest weekly increase since late 2011 during the Euro crisis, and during German reunification in August 1990. The spread is now +76.7bps with our rates strategists targeting +90bps. They think +90-100bps would be the equivalent to the 2017 Presidential election peak of +80bps when adjusting for today’s French fundamentals. In equity risk, the CAC 40 fell -6.23% last week (-2.66% on Friday), its largest weekly move down since March 2022 and apart from another big differential in the early Covid period you’d have to go back to the aftermath of 9/11 in 2001 to see such extremes. China’s sluggish May economic data (see opening post) will increase calls for interest rate cuts, predicts Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING. Song points out that the Chinese property market continued to slump despite a supportive policy push by Beijing, and points out that prices for ‘used homes’ (rather than newbuilds) also fell in May. China’s 70-city housing prices continued to decline in May, with new home and used home prices down -0.7% month-on-month and -1.0% MoM respectively, both seeing the steepest monthly sequential declines of the current cycle. From the peak, new home prices have declined -6.4% and the secondary market has declined -12.3%. Of the 70 city sample, only two cities (Shanghai and Taiyuan) saw an increase in prices in May for new homes, while none saw an increase in the secondary market. This was notably worse off compared to April, when six cities saw increases in new home prices and one city saw an increase in secondary market prices. Year to date, two cities saw new home prices increase, and none saw secondary market prices increases. 16 and 48 cities within the sample have seen declines of over 3% in primary and secondary markets respectively. New home sales remained well in contraction at -27.9% year-on-year YTD. ING suspects that the odds of a PBoC rate cut in the coming months have risen, given today’s economic data and recent rate cuts by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada. Last week was a tough one for French financial assets, with stocks sliding and the spread between French and German 10-year government bonds widening. Political uncertainty abounds again today, following President Emmanuel Macron’s surprise decision to call a snap vote. Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally is leading in opinion polls, while France’s left-wing parties have formed a new alliance to fight the election. The euro is slightly weaker this morning, dipping below $1.07 in early trading, towards the six-week low hit on Friday. Chris Weston, analyst at Pepperstone, says there is a real prospect of further downside in French and EU markets before the elections to the national assembly are completed early next month. The worry, Weston explains, is that France could move away from its planned €20bn of spending cuts, which would push up its budget deficit, adding: The evolving theme in French politics continues to see market players attempting to price risk and uncertainty around the future French fiscal position and what this could mean for France’s credit rating, and the cost to fund a wider deficit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Lukewarm Chinese economic data, and political instability in France, has dampened market sentiment at the start of the new week. In China, new home prices fell at the fastest pace in almost 10 years in May, new data shows, despite Beijing’s efforts to prop up its property sector. In annual terms, new home prices were down 3.9% from a year earlier, worse than the 3.1% slide in April. During May alone, prices dipped by 0.7%. National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) spokesperson Liu Aihua told a media briefing on Monday that the property market is undergoing adjustment and it will take some time for policy measures to kick in. The declines were broad-based: prices fell in 68 of the 70 cities surveyed by the government, up from 64 in April. Policymakers have been attempting to rein in the oversupply of housing, and support debt-laden developers since the market went into freefall in 2020, hit by the pandemic and a sudden regulatory crackdown on indebted lenders. Last month, the People’s Bank of China cut mortgage rates and allowed local authorities to turn unsold homes from developers into affordable housing, But this has not, yet, revived a sector in which a glut of unoccupied property is weighing on the market. As my colleague Amy Hawkins reported this month: All across China, from Beijing in the north, to Shenzhen in the south, millions of newly built homes stand empty and unwanted. There were nearly 391m sq metres of unsold residential property in China as of April, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That is the equivalent of Manchester and Birmingham combined – and then some – sitting as vacant, unwanted property. The crux of the problem is that, with shaky faith in the economy and big property developers failing to deliver on paid-for apartments, potential homebuyers are keeping their money out of the market. However, China’s property sector isn’t the only area struggling; factories grew slower than expected last month. Industrial output grew 5.6% in May, year-on-year, from a year earlier, NBS data showed, compared with 6.7% in April. Economists had expected growth of around 6%. China’s retail sales were more positive: they beat expectations in May by climbing 3.7% year-on-year, ahead of forecasts of a 3% rise. Overall, investors seem unimpressed, wth China’s SSE Composite index dipping by 0.6% today. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, reports that sentiment is gloomy: The latest data showed that home prices there slid at a faster pace in May despite all the efforts that the Chinese government puts in to stop the bleeding and industrial production slowed significantly more than expected, as well, during the same month. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is expected to maintain its rates unchanged this week, but some economists at Bloomberg believe that the week could bring a 10bp cut in China to prop things up.

        "title": "Balance effects of AI with profits tax and green levy, says IMF",
        "content": "Governments faced with economic upheaval caused by artificial intelligence should consider fiscal policies including taxes on excess profits and a green levy to atone for AI-related carbon emissions, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF said unlike previous technological breakthroughs such as the steam engine, generative AI – the term for computer systems such as ChatGPT that can produce convincing, human-like text, voices and images from simple prompts – can spread “much faster” and advances in the technology are happening at “breakneck speed”. The international lender of last resort said governments should consider a range of policies to mitigate the impact on jobs, including a carbon tax to account for the environmental impact of operating the computer servers that train and operate AI systems. “Given the large amount of energy consumed by AI servers, taxing the associated carbon emissions is a good way to reflect the external environmental costs in the price of the technology,” said the IMF in a report published on Monday. AI currently accounts for less than half of electricity use in datacentres but it could become their main source of consumption and push up the overall amount of electricity such facilities require, according to a recent report. Datacentres, servers and data transmission networks account for up to 1.5% of global emissions at present. The report also warned that the share of wages as a proportion of national income may decline further as a result of AI, causing a widening of inequality, while dominant tech companies could reinforce their market power and reap excessive financial rewards. The IMF report counselled against taxing investment in AI but suggested raising capital income taxes such as corporation tax and personal income taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains. The changes could include an excess profits tax, said the IMF. It added that corporate income tax had recently come under “severe pressure” from profit shifting and some countries lowering their rates. “More effective taxation of capital income requires restoration of the corporate incomes tax and calls for well-designed excess profit taxes, higher personal income taxes on capital through better enforcement of automatic information exchange between countries, and enhanced taxation of capital gains,” said the IMF. The IMF said there were many potential benefits for the private and public sectors including cost savings, new sources of revenue and more efficient delivery of services. However, it warned that AI could hit jobs across the skills spectrum, affecting both white-collar and blue-collar jobs. Research suggests that AI will primarily affect white-collar professions such as law, finance and medicine, but the IMF added that manufacturing or trade-related jobs in the blue-collar sector could also be hit. The IMF estimates about 60% of jobs in advanced economies such as the US and UK are exposed to AI and half of these jobs may be negatively affected. “Labour-saving automation could amplify job losses in both low-skill and cognitive occupations,” said the IMF. It added that an AI-related increase in productivity – a measure of economic efficiency, or the amount of output generated by a worker for each hour worked – could create new jobs but such a transition could be “costly”. The report, Broadening the Gains from Generative AI, made a number of other recommendations, including: extending unemployment insurance to self-employed workers; targeting social benefits at people “permanently displaced” by AI-related job disruption; and gearing education and training towards giving workers new skills and ability to adapt to new technologies. It also recommended using AI, and its analytical abilities, to overhaul the tax systems and introduce new levies, such as a real-time market-value-based property tax. The report also expressed caution about universal basic income, under which working-age adults are given a state stipend regardless of their earnings or employment status, saying it would generate significant costs. It said providing “unconditional benefits to all” would cover higher-income groups, “potentially generating significant fiscal costs”. Era Dabla-Norris, the deputy director of the IMF’s fiscal affairs department and a co-author of the report, said if AI led to “much more significant disruption” in the future, then governments might consider UBI. “Countries could start thinking about how such systems could be designed and implemented,” she added.",

        "content": "Tesco has installed smoke machines in some of its stores to stop people from stealing goods after night-time break-ins. Britain’s biggest supermarket chain uses the 4ft-high security devices in some stores at high risk of burglary outside opening hours. The Sun first reported that the machines are brought on to the shop floor of some London stores after they are closed. If motion sensors are activated, the machine fills the store with dense fog, making it hard to see and steal goods. The machines are also fitted with a CCTV camera. The use of the units is not new or a universal policy. A message on the front of the machine reads: “Warning: you’re being watched. Smoke screen security fog in operation.” A photo has been shared online of one of the devices on a shop floor in central London during opening hours. The unit was not plugged in or in use and had since been removed. It is understood there is no plan to expand the use of the devices to other Tesco stores. The supermarket declined to comment on their use. Shoplifting and attacks on shop workers has risen in the UK, with figures released in February showing 1,300 incidents of violence and abuse a day. In April a British Retail Consortium report found that instances of violence and abuse in shopping centres had risen by 65% from 2021-22 to 2022-23. Body armour suppliers said demand for stab vests worn by shopping centre security staff had soared over the past two years. The government announced plans to introduce tougher punishments for serial or abusive shoplifters in England and Wales under a new standalone criminal offence of assaulting a retail worker. The measure had been due to be appended to the criminal justice bill going through parliament this summer, but it was one of several that were dropped during May’s “wash-up” – the period when pending legislation is swiftly pushed through before an election.",

        "title": "UK manufacturers expecting boost in second half of 2024 ",
        "content": "Britain’s largest manufacturers are expecting orders and output to increase dramatically in the second half of the year, even as a chronic shortage of skilled workers is threatening the ability of some companies to do business. Manufacturing is returning to normal business conditions after wild swings in demand during the pandemic, disruptions in prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the effect on supply chains of blockages and conflict around the Suez canal, according to a survey of 320 companies by the trade body Make UK. The share of manufacturing businesses experiencing an improvement in their order books has doubled in the past three months, Make UK said. Growth has been powered by exports, with strong demand from the US making up for sluggish conditions at home. But cooling prices and potential cuts to interest rates have boosted hopes of much stronger growth in the second half of the year, and business confidence has risen to equal its highest level in the past decade. Make UK is expecting manufacturing to grow by 1.2% in 2024, beating GDP growth of 0.9% for the year. But optimism in the sector is dampened by a shortage of skilled workers that must be at the heart of the next government’s plans for industry, companies said. The measures proposed by Labour and the Tories in their election manifestos were only part-solutions to a decade of mismanagement of the apprenticeship system, Make UK said. Rishi Sunak has committed to closing down poorly performing university courses to fund 100,000 apprenticeship places over the next five years. Meanwhile, Labour said it would allow employers to spend up to 50% of their apprenticeship levy on accredited non-apprenticeship training under a new growth and skills levy, giving them greater freedom in the way they spend their funds. James Brougham, a senior economist at Make UK, said: “At long last, manufacturers can see concrete signs of growth and a much better economic outlook ahead … The next government must capitalise on this scenario by delivering a modern, long-term industrial strategy which goes beyond the 2030s and has cross-government support. “This must be supported by a revolution in skills, a shortage of which is the biggest factor affecting not just companies’ growth prospects but, in many cases, their ability to maintain daily operations and fulfil contracts.”",

On Sunday evening the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said This had “taken the precautionary step of recalling its This Isn’t Chicken and Bacon wrap because of possible contamination with E coli”. The FSA said the company, which supplies the vegan meat-substitute wraps only to WH Smith, had not detected E coli in the product. On Friday the Guardian revealed that Greencore, which supplies sandwiches, wraps and salads to many of the UK’s biggest supermarkets, had recalled 45 wraps, sandwiches and salads. Samworth Brothers, which supplies Tesco and the One Stop convenience store chain, has recalled 15 lines of sandwiches and wraps. The This wraps being recalled have a best before date of 18 June. Customers who bought one are asked to return it to WH Smith for a full refund, with or without the receipt. A spokesperson for the FSA said on Sunday that investigations into the source of the E coli outbreak were continuing. The recalled products are understood to contain a variety of salad leaf linked to the outbreak identified this month by the UK Health Security Agency. The UKHSA has said it expected the number of people falling ill as a result of the outbreak to rise further as it carried out more research using genome sequencing to check which E coli cases were linked. On Friday, Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: “Retailers affected are taking swift action to remove these products from sale and are working closely with the Food Standards Agency to take any further action needed to minimise risk to their customers.”",

        "title": " FAA investigates after Southwest plane drops to ‘within 400ft’ of Pacific Ocean",
        "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating after a Southwest Airlines flight reportedly plunged to “within 400ft” of the Pacific Ocean during a flight. A memo distributed to Southwest pilots, obtained by Bloomberg, said that the Boeing 737 Max 8 plunged at a rate of 4,000ft a minute off the coast of Hawaii, coming within hundreds of feet of the ocean before climbing to safety. News of the incident comes as investigators said a Southwest-operated Boeing 737 Max 8 sustained significant damage after it did a “Dutch roll” during a flight from Phoenix to Oakland in May. The plunge off the coast of Hawaii occurred on 11 April, amid adverse weather conditions. The plane had been flying from Honolulu to Lihue when it experienced the rapid descent, Bloomberg reported. The report said the descent took the plane to about 400ft above the ocean, according to data from a flight tracking website. No one was injured. “Nothing is more important to Southwest than Safety,” the airline said in a statement provided to media outlets. “Through our robust Safety Management System, the event was addressed appropriately as we always strive for continuous improvement.” The FAA told CNN that it learned of the incident immediately and opened an investigation. The plane eventually re-routed to Honolulu. In the separate incident, on Friday Bloomberg reported that a Boeing 737 Max suffered damage to parts of the plane’s structure after it went into a “Dutch roll” during a Southwest Airlines flight in May. The incident happened as the jet cruised at 34,000ft from Arizona to California. Associated Press reported that the plane landed safely, but said Southwest did not notify the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) about the roll or damage to the jetliner until 7 June. “Following the event, SWA performed maintenance on the airplane and discovered damage to structural components,” the NTSB said. A Dutch roll occurs when the plane’s tail slides from side to side, and the plane rocks in a way that causes the wings to roll up and down. A report by the FAA said that “substantial” damage was discovered to a unit that controls backup power to the plane’s rudder. It is unclear what triggered the incident, which was the latest to involve a Boeing 737 Max aircraft. In January the FAA ordered nearly 200 Boeing 737 Max 9 to stop flying after a chunk of fuselage blew out of the plane mid-flight. The planes were allowed to return to the air after undergoing an expansive inspection and maintenance process. Last year Southwest agreed to pay a record-setting $140m civil penalty after a December 2022 holiday meltdown left 2 million passengers stranded at airports around the US. The airline canceled 8,000 flights over a four-day period, following a winter storm. The US Department of Transportation found that Southwest violated consumer protection laws by failing to provide adequate customer service assistance “via its call center to hundreds of thousands of customers”, as well as failing to provide prompt flight status notifications to more than 1 million passengers and prompt refunds to thousands.",

        "title": "UK attractions try to win back visitors as post-Covid ‘revenge spending’ ends",
        "content": "The period of post-Covid “revenge spending” has ended, leaving businesses having to look at different ways to attract customers, the chief operating officer of Merlin Entertainments has said. The term revenge spending was coined to describe how people looked to splash the cash they had saved up during the Covid pandemic on products or experiences that would help make up for time lost to lockdowns. Fiona Eastwood, the COO of Merlin Entertainments, which owns Alton Towers, Legoland and the London Eye, told the Guardian that the business had seen a change in spending habits since last summer, and had had to alter some of its tactics to continue to bring in customers. “What we saw coming out of Covid, was what was termed revenge spending, and that has definitely gone away,” she said. “We saw [it] from the middle of August last year, with the impact of interest rates, impacting on what people had in their pockets, and we have had to pivot, and that is as much about domestic, as inbound trade, and across pretty much every market.” Eastwood said that the business, which owns 140 attractions in more than 20 countries, had had to “pivot” from what it was doing coming out of Covid, by putting on more promotions with newspapers and food brands, and increasing its focus on selling season passes. She added that the company was seeing “green shoots of recovery” and had spent £90m this year on capital investments in its UK businesses, which include 29 attractions. Eastwood’s comments came during UKHospitality’s summer conference, at which the trade body called for the government to reduce VAT for the sector from 20% to 12.5%. UKHospitality said this would put VAT in the UK closer to that in other countries, and would create 85,000 new jobs and add £3.2bn to the sector. During the pandemic, VAT on tourist attractions and hospitality was cut to support the reopening of businesses after lockdowns, first to 5% and then 12.5%, before returning to its current level in April 2022. Brian Keeley-Whiting, the managing director of WH Pubs, said a VAT cut would be his top ask of any incoming government. Keeley-Whiting, who owns four gastro pubs in Sussex and Kent, said that he thought the current level was “really wrong” and that pubs were having to contend with supermarkets that were not facing the same challenges. Philip Thorley, whose business Thorley Taverns owns 18 pubs across Kent, said: “We pay the highest VAT in Europe, we should have a special case for hospitality in the UK because we employ a lot of people and a lot of people at entry level, and our margins are being squeezed every which way.” The latest UKHospitality figures show that between 2021 and 2023, 22,859 businesses in the UK hospitality sector closed, while 11,734 opened. Eastwood, who is also a UKHospitality board member, said: “There is the cost of energy, the cost of labour and the VAT. When we reduced VAT to half during Covid, we saw an immediate bounce back for businesses.”",

        "content": "Hybrid working makes employees happier, healthier and more productive, according to research among UK staff who divide their working week between home and the office. Three-quarters of those who work flexibly found they felt less burnout than when they spent their whole week in the office. Hybrid working brings a huge range of benefits for employees’ sleep, eating habits, stress levels and overall sense of wellbeing, according to a survey of 1,026 people who work that way. Large majorities reported feeling less drained (79%), less stressed (78%) and less anxious (72%) as a result of spending part of the week working from home. Meanwhile, 86% said the increase in the amount of free time they had from no longer having to travel to work every day improved their work/life balance and helped them feel they could cope better with the challenges of daily life, the International Workplace Group (IWG) survey found. Hybrid workers cited benefits including: better quality of sleep (68%) more exercise (54%) healthier meal preparation (58%) better health overall (68%) Three-quarters said that going back to working five days a week from a central office would damage their wellbeing. “Little has done more over the years to depress, stress and irritate workers than the daily commute. It separates families, fractures communities, pollutes the environment and wastes vast amounts of time and money,” said Mark Dixon, IWG’s chief executive. The research, by Mortar Research, “shows the substantial health and wellbeing benefits to those working in the hybrid model, with workers using the time saved from commuting less to enjoy an improved quality of life and work/life balance. “Employees are now significantly healthier and happier and feel more in control of their lives.” Crucially, the survey also found that about three in four hybrid workers felt they were more productive (74%) and more motivated (76%) because of splitting their week, while 85% said it had improved their job satisfaction. The findings tally with research published last week in the scientific journal Nature by Nick Bloom , a Stanford University professor of economics and expert in home working. Hybrid working improves job satisfaction, makes no difference to productivity and reduces quitting by staff – especially women, non-managers and those with a long commute – by a third, Bloom found after studying 1,612 staff at a Chinese technology company. In addition, 395 managers in the study who were initially negative about employees working from home two days a week switched to being positive overall about it when they saw how it worked. Dr Jen Rhymer, an expert in the future of work in University College London’s school of management, said IWG’s findings underline how “unsurprisingly, a hybrid work arrangement is the most in-demand benefit” that people request before taking a job. “Numerous studies have demonstrated that remote and hybrid work is as or more productive than fully in-office work,” she said. “It has also been shown to improve job satisfaction and retention. Work stress and exhaustion is reduced with working from home, increased autonomy being a key factor in this.” Organisations that offer flexible working are more likely to attract younger staff and be less affected by the labour shortages that have become common in recent years, Dixon said. “This study also shows the vital importance of hybrid working for firms aiming to attract younger employees who favour the flexibility it offers,” he added. “Offering a mix of remote and in-office work, companies can provide the sought-after work/life balance that enhances employee wellbeing and productivity.” IWG are a leading provider globally of hybrid working set-ups. The 1,026 participants in their survey were representative of the UK population by region and gender. Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “Despite recent changes in legislation employers still have free rein to turn down any and all requests for flexible working. And people are often too scared to ask for flexible working at job interviews for fear of being discriminated against.” But, he added: “Labour’s new deal for working people will strengthen flexible working rules by making flexible working a default right from day one.”",

        "title": "Recovery and interest rate cuts won’t be enough to win Sunak the election",
        "content": "As the weeks roll by, Rishi Sunak’s decision to call the election before he needed to appears ever more curious. Unemployment is up and growth has stalled. NHS waiting lists have increased. There will be better news from this week’s annual inflation figures but it won’t make a difference to voting intentions. The case for holding on until the autumn was that it would give time for the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates and for recovery to become more firmly embedded. That case now looks all the stronger. Threadneedle Street is not going to deliver a pre-election cut in interest rates this week and by the time it does start to reduce the cost of borrowing, the Conservatives will be long gone. Likewise, when the growth figures for the second quarter come out in August they are likely to show solid – if unspectacular growth – of about 0.4-0.5%. After the 0.6% growth in the first quarter, it would have made Sunak’s argument that the economy has turned a corner that much stronger. In truth, though, waiting until the autumn would have only delayed the inevitable. As the election for the European parliament clearly showed, there is a big anti-incumbency factor at play. That was evident in Germany, where all three members of the ruling coalition polled badly. It was evident in France, where Emmanuel Macron has taken the gamble of calling a snap election after Marine Le Pen’s National Rally won 32% of the European parliament votes. And it will be evident in the UK on 4 July, when voters will kick out the party that has been in power for the past 14 years. There is no little irony in post-Brexit Britain being on the point of electing a soft-left Labour government when large chunks of the EU have lurched to the right. Indeed, the notion that life on the other side of the Channel is one of progressive rationality looks a bit silly in light of the state of politics in the EU’s three biggest countries: Germany, France and Italy. Wasn’t it Brexit Britain that was supposed to be the cradle for fascism? The truth is that the vote against the status quo in the UK in 2016 and the vote against the political establishment in the EU elections last week had the same roots: inequality, nugatory growth in living standards, unhappiness about high levels of migration, and a growing realisation that the parties of the centre-left and centre-right were in hock to a liberal economic orthodoxy that every now and then shifted power from one party of technocrats to another but offered no prospect of fundamentally changing anything. Now chickens are coming home to roost. The Conservatives in the UK face being reduced to a rump, with Nigel Farage keen to engineer a reverse takeover. It is unsurprising that people in the UK are unhappy with the Conservatives. What is surprising is that it has taken five elections for voters to come to the conclusion that the Tories have no real answers to the problems facing the UK. If Labour proves equally bereft of ideas, the backlash will be brutal and – notwithstanding Labour’s likely massive parliamentary majority – not long in coming. The task of boosting productivity, raising living standards and spreading prosperity to all parts of the UK is a formidable one. The Resolution Foundation thinktank says per capita income has grown by just 4.3% in total during the 16 years since the financial crisis, compared with 46% in the 16 years prior to that. Meanwhile, the EU has experienced decades of weak growth and its share of global GDP has fallen from 28% to 17% since 1980. In large part that has been due to the straitjacket imposed by monetary union, but matters have not been helped by strict budgetary controls demanded by Brussels. It is no accident that growth was a lot higher before Europe embarked on its drive for ever closer union. It would be wrong to think that the EU is unique, because pretty much every country in the developed west is experiencing the same swirling discontent. Even the US, a country that has maintained its share of global GDP while the EU has been slipping back, is displaying strong anti-incumbency sentiment. The US has plenty of things going for it. It controls the world’s main reserve currency. It is more willing to take risks with economic policy. It has the world’s biggest and fastest-growing companies. It has recovered much more quickly from the Covid-19 pandemic than other western nations, and it was less affected than Europe by the cost of living crisis. Joe Biden should really be comfortably ahead of Donald Trump in the race to win this year’s presidential race. The US has come closest to find a new growth model to replace the one that seriously malfunctioned during the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008. To his credit, Biden has been prepared to break with orthodox thinking by running big budget deficits, investing heavily in a green industrial strategy and by slapping tariffs on Chinese imports. It has been clear since the GFC that something has gone wrong with western capitalism and that a different approach is required. The past decade and a half have been marked by weak investment, modest growth in living standards, attempts to prune welfare bills and large migration flows. The rise of populist parties is a direct consequence of these trends and of the failure of mainstream political parties to respond to them. Social democratic parties came about to protect working people from insecurity. All too often, they have been missing in action.",

        "title": "Parents attending their child’s job interview? As a manager, I’m all for it!",
        "content": "Many have thrown up their hands in horror at news that one in four of gen-Z job applicants – those aged between 18 and 27 – have admitted to bringing a parent to their job interview, according to a recent survey. What a bunch of snowflakes! These are people old enough to vote and join the military and see R-rated movies and even live independently. And what! They can’t go on a job interview without bringing along their mommy and daddy? Well, I love it. Let’s embrace these parents. Invite them in. Give them coffee. Encourage their participation. Why? Because a parent can reveal a lot. What if the parents don’t show up to the interview, or arrive late? What if they display a lack of respect or treat the interviewer – or even each other – disdainfully? Conversely, interviewing a mom or dad who is genuinely honest, caring and supportive would tell me something. Showing a willingness to share both the strengths and faults of their child could give me insights I never would’ve discovered without them. Hearing about their family backgrounds, health issues and jobs would help me determine if their child comes from good stock and a strong support system. I could also use the interview with the candidate’s parents to ask questions like “Why do you think your child would make a good candidate for this job?” and “When was the last time they were punished and for what?” I could dig deeper into whether or not the child hangs out with the right crowd, what TV shows they like, what celebrities they admire, how they treat their siblings as well as other family matters. I can ask personal questions about their boyfriends and girlfriends and activities in their spare time and whether or not they have health issues or an arrest record or extreme views on topics. Am I crossing the boundaries as to what’s appropriate – or legal – to ask in a job interview? Hell no! I’m not really interviewing the gen Zer. I’m instead interviewing the parents! They’re not the ones applying for the job so I’m not at risk of being sued by or fined or violating any statute. The world’s my oyster. And, as a parent, I also know this: many parents can be a lot more honest than you might think. Just dig a little into the last time their “perfect” child threw that party when they were out of town. Or ignored their pleas to mow the lawn. Or drank directly out of the milk carton after being told not to. Or shoplifted with their friends at the corner grocery store. A good interviewer, with a few winks and nods, can draw out this information from an unsuspecting parent. There’s no argument that parents love their children. But you know what they love even more? Complaining about their children. As a hiring manager, you want to hear these complaints to get a more honest picture of who this kid really is and whether or not they’ll be a good employee. Besides, isn’t society demanding that parents take more responsibility for their kids’ actions? Many are warning about a “wave of legal consequences” for parents who don’t take responsibility for their kids’ behavior. So in a way, we’re actually protecting the parents by having them step up and do what’s right. And they’re helping us to not make the wrong decision by hiring their lazy son or daughter. Win, win. So come on in, parents! Join the interview! We’ll nibble on biscuits. We’ll have a chit-chat. We’ll really find out what’s going on at home. You’ve got a lot of stories to tell about this prospective job candidate and I am all ears.",

        "title": "Struggle to damp down inflation leaves Tories’ election hopes high and dry",
        "content": "Conservative party members could be forgiven for believing that the economy had become their friend after the Liz Truss mini-budget debacle faded from view. Heading into 2024, there was an expectation of a return to growth. And the first three months of data showed that a bounceback from last year’s recession was in train and that household disposable incomes were on the rise. It was widely reported that Rishi Sunak’s election gamble was built, at least in part, on figures that showed the economy was on the up and a hope that this would in turn improve his prospects in a national vote. Last week, the plan began to unravel when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy had flatlined in April, with 0% growth. Bad weather was partly to blame, reducing the footfall on high streets and forcing building companies to delay some construction projects, but the cold and rain could not account for the downturn in manufacturing or the lack of growth in UK exports. Separate data for the jobs market in the three months to the end of April were also a disappointment. The figures showed a rise in unemployment and companies withdrawing job adverts in a sign of waning confidence in the outlook for the economy. Another test for Sunak is due on Wednesday, when the ONS will publish inflation figures for May. The consumer prices index (CPI) is expected to fall to 2% – the Bank of England’s target – from 2.3% in April. Significantly, though, that is not expected to be enough to persuade the Bank to cut interest rates when it announces its latest decision on Thursday. Sunak made five pledges last year, including one to halve inflation from above 10%. While this has been achieved, it has not happened quickly enough to convince the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) – at least for the time being – that it has been definitively beaten. The CPI index’s fall to 2.3% last month, from 3.2% in March, was not as much as analysts had expected. Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The big surprise when the figures were published last month was the strength of inflation across the services sector. And the big question this time is whether this was a one-off or whether state and private-sector services firms are consistently, month after month, increasing prices.” Wood – who is among those who predicts inflation will have fallen to 2% in May – is firmly in the one-off camp. He cites the increase in passport fees and the 6.7% rise in the TV licence fee in April as examples of one-off cost increases affecting household budgets. Mortgage borrowers, who have suffered a dramatic increase in monthly interest costs, will be hoping the Bank agrees. Last year, financial markets were expecting that the combination of a steep fall in inflation during 2024 and a stagnant economy would trigger – perhaps as early as May – the first rate cut by the Bank since 2020. As late as November last year, investors were betting that officials in Threadneedle Street would be viewing inflation as a transitory phenomenon, albeit for a longer transition period than they first forecast. Meanwhile, persistently low growth would mean the economy would need help from lower borrowing costs. That was then. These days, markets expect the MPC to hold interest rates at 5.25% at every meeting until November, betting that only then will borrowing costs begin to come down. The Bank appears to want further evidence that rising prices are no longer a concern. It will be watching the US Federal Reserve, which has signalled a long delay before it takes action to lower rates, citing strong cost increases in the services sector for its decision. Fed chair Jerome Powell described price growth as “still too high” after a modest drop from 3.4% to 3.3% in May. Wood says the falling costs of energy and food have fully run their course. That means services inflation needs to moderate or there is much less chance of the Bank making any interest rate cuts this year.",

        "content": "Everyone wants the Labour leadership to be more honest with the electorate about how it will pay for policies designed to drive growth, tackle the climate crisis and improve living standards. Without a jolt to the economy from tens of billions of pounds of extra spending, they argue, growth will remain sloth-like, only inching ahead, and the Labour project will be doomed. Tory-supporting newspapers are asking the question for their own reasons, saying Labour’s ambitions must still, despite being scaled down, herald higher taxes. Many Labour supporters who want a more activist state want to know why Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have refused to lay out a broader canvas, one that depicts an active, reformist programme. And they also want Starmer and Reeves to explain to the voting public that, in the absence of higher taxes, extra borrowing is the solution to a lack of funds and can be justified by the long-term benefits. Activists calling for this boldness say the party needs to pursue policies of devolution and nationalisation, lining up the billions of pounds needed to achieve both aims. Again, it follows that such grands projets could help give the nation the electric charge it needs to wake from a 14-year slumber. What seems strange, as the attacks against Starmer become more aggressive, is how little regard is paid to the electorate and what voters have come to understand about the economy since the 2008 financial crash. There is a leftist belief that the arguments for extra borrowing and a larger state are already won, or if not won, then could be adopted by the next Labour government safe in the knowledge they will succeed. Starmer and Reeves can see little evidence of voter support for an economic revolution based on either much higher taxes or higher borrowing. These are difficult economic times and people are understandably nervous. If they turn half an ear to reports by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), they will hear how the UK’s 97% ratio of debt to national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), is already too high. Should they turn on the evening news, they will see charts showing that by 2027-28 the ratio of tax to GDP is on course to reach its highest level since the second world war. The influence of ostensibly independent international arbiters of “economic laws” is always underestimated. One of the triggers for the political strife in France is a recent downgrading of its ability to pay debt interest by one of the big ratings agencies. Emmanuel Macron’s ministers have been scrabbling to save more than €10bn this year to prevent another downgrade should the ratio of debt to GDP reach 117%, as forecast. The cuts caused widespread discontent and damaged his expansionist reputation. These are not agencies that can be ignored. They influence the thinking of central banks, thinktanks and finance ministries. They dominate the economic debate. Starmer and Reeves know that if any progress is to be made, it must be by stealth. The rationalists will howl with dismay at such a strategy, but the English have only rarely embraced what we might call a help-thy-neighbour welfarism in preference to the John Bull spirit of the 19th century. We can point to the aftermath of the second world war as a period when Labour was bold, but the circumstances were radically different. We can refer to our neighbour’s higher taxes and nationalised industries, but France’s statist policies cannot easily be replicated. Neither can the regional apparatus and local banks that support the German economy. For one thing, Germany has been a collection of regional entities for centuries, defined through struggle and by arbitrary county lines drawn by civil servants, as in the UK. Then we need to ask: would the state do a better job of running the water companies, the railways and the energy companies? If you think so, what is your evidence? Britain’s state authorities cannot all be labelled ramshackle, but many have become rundown after more than a decade of austerity. The people running them are shellshocked and have become decision-phobic. The HS2 high speed train line between London, Birmingham and Manchester didn’t founder because engineering costs rocketed. That was a symptom of a state that couldn’t make up its mind what it wanted from the initial £38bn investment and that indecision helped push the bill far higher. Councils have made huge mistakes that cannot be explained by a lack of funding. Voters in Nottingham know what happened when the local authority tried its hand at selling electricity and gas. The company went bust, leaving behind a multimillion-pound bill for local council tax payers. Labour plans to be circumspect about how quickly it ramps up investments when it kickstarts the British energy scheme, and rightly so. Reeves and Starmer know the financial and institutional constraints ahead of them. They will need skill and guile to guide the ship of state, tacking this way and that to reach their destination.",

        "content": "When I began reporting on the gambling sector in 2015, I didn’t have any preconceptions about the industry. After all, it rarely seemed to make front-page news. One reason for this, I would later learn, is that problem gambling and addiction often fly under the radar, not just at a societal level but even within close-knit families. An addict can plunge their whole family into punishing debt with a few taps of their mobile phone, while their partner sits beside them on the sofa, blissfully unaware. Friday saw the start of Euro 2024, a huge moment for the industry to try to attract new customers through adverts. However, you won’t see any in the Guardian. One year ago today, we announced a global ban on gambling advertising. We could only do this because our journalism is powered by the financial support of our readers. Gambling adverts aren’t just a concern for people who already have a gambling problem. We live in a world shaped by the 2005 Gambling Act, which unleashed a tidal wave of betting ads, first through TV and radio but later through social media and online. Nearly 20 years later, little is known about the effect that such exposure is having on young people who have grown up surrounded by these ads. As I began to dig into the gambling sector and learn more about it, stories of exploitation and misery came bubbling up at such a rate that, having at first been jaw-dropping, they became almost routine. I would see the same patterns: happy, carefree people driven to despair, crime and even suicide, while powerful corporations lined their pockets, rarely questioning where the money was coming from. Nobody seemed to be doing anything to curb the worst excesses of the industry, least of all politicians. Indeed, many lawmakers seemed to walk arm in arm with the gambling companies, even taking lucrative second jobs with online bookmakers and casinos. Over the years, the Guardian has sought to shine a light on the dark side of this industry, providing a counterbalance to the hundreds of millions spent every year on adverts that give the impression that it’s all just a bit of fun. We dug deep into the dangers associated with fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which were eventually curbed in 2019, their stakes cut from £100 a spin to £2. Targeted use of freedom of information legislation allowed us to uncover the extent to which gambling companies relied on controversial VIP schemes, which reward the biggest gambling losers with freebies. We revealed details of the MPs who received hospitality or even salaries from gambling companies, while in a position to influence policy. The entanglement between football and betting is a subject we’ve returned to time and again, including our revelation that English football clubs were taking a cut of their fans’ losses. From high street slot machine farms exploiting vulnerable people to video game loot boxes that teach children the mechanics of gambling, from the Russian business links of the national lottery’s owner to the addictive side of crypto trading, every aspect of gambling regulation in the UK has featured on our pages at some stage. These stories can be difficult – practically, emotionally and legally – to tell. In-depth reporting takes time and money, as does the endless task of fending off pushback from the subjects of that reporting. Often, we meet with resistance from highly paid public relations consultants or law firms who want to manipulate what we write, or prevent it from being written at all. Thankfully, the Guardian’s reader-funded model means that rather than focus on cheap clicks, we can devote time and resources to independent journalism, knowing that we have the full force of the Guardian and its readership behind us. If you’re able to, we’d greatly appreciate it if you could join us in our mission today. You can support all the work we do from just £4 a month, or even with a one-off payment. Support from readers allowed the Guardian to take that landmark decision last year to stop accepting gambling advertising, a choice I was happy to be consulted on and which should give readers further comfort that we’ll never pull our punches when it comes to holding the industry to account. We couldn’t have taken that decision, and we couldn’t do the kind of journalism we do, without the continued support of our readers. That’s why we serve them above anyone else, reporting without fear or favour, often against the odds. Thank you.",

        "content": "Science labs, parks, health centres and community arts hubs, lecture halls, bowling alleys and even a submarine training centre. Former Debenhams stores across the UK are being reinvented with a dizzying array of new uses as councils and landlords battle to fill millions of square feet of space left empty after the demise of the department store chain in May 2021. The Debenhams name continues online under new owners but – three years after the department store chain left the high street – more than half of the former stores remain empty or are in the process of being redeveloped, according to research by Local Data Company for the Guardian. Only a third of the enormous sites, many of which are the keystone of local high streets, are now occupied by retailers, although a further 7% have a new occupier lined up according to the LDC research. Cities and towns including Basingstoke, Exeter, Middlesbrough, Nottingham, Sheffield and Swansea have yet to fill the large gap on their high streets or have not confirmed plans for the site, with several of those places also having lost a House of Fraser or a John Lewis as well. Only a handful of the former Debenhams shops have become new department stores, with independents Bobby’s and Bradbeers opening in Bournemouth and Salisbury respectively. Marks &amp; Spencer and the owner of House of Fraser, Frasers Group, have both filled a number of former Debenhams stores. Frasers has picked from its huge array of retail brands, from Sports Direct to luxury casual wear purveyor Flannels, Everlast gyms and its Frasers mini department store format to fill the spaces. Next and Primark have also taken large chunks of space while, last November, Ikea’s parent group bought the Brighton mall that previously housed Debenhams with a view to repeating its successful reinvention of the Kings Mall in Hammersmith in west London, where it also filled a defunct Debenhams. But with evidence that 52% of UK destinations have too much retail space, according to consultancy CACI, the majority of Debenhams sites are unlikely to be filled by more shops. Instead there are plans to turn former Debenhams into science labs in Oxford and Cambridge, a park in Cardiff, health centres in Basildon, Bangor and Carmarthen and lecture halls in Gloucester. Perhaps most unlikely, aerospace and defence group BAE Systems has bought the Debenhams in Barrow with a plan to build a training centre for submarine engineers. “It was a blow,” admits Michelle McPhee, the town centre manager for Middlesbrough, as she contemplates the struggle to fill Debenhams, an empty House of Fraser that sits opposite in the centre of town and a more recently closed Marks &amp; Spencer and Wilko. “But it wasn’t a shock. Department stores were closing as retail is changing and because of Covid. We were quite prepared.” Middlesbrough is one of the hardest hit town centres in the country from the mass closure of department stores, many of which continue to lie empty as few retailers continue to want the kind of space they occupied. While the town has 1.4m sq ft of space over just four retailers to fill, there is a will and determination not just to put any tenant in that space. The council has set a strategy with entertainment, retail and leisure zones within the town centre and is trying to build a mix of attractions to entice footfall back. Its Debenhams building, which was finally bought from administrators by a local property developer in January, and House of Fraser, which is now owned by the Tees Valley Combined Authority’s Middlesbrough Development Corporation, are likely to be redeveloped for a mix of uses – with retail on the ground floor and offices, a hotel or another form of accommodation above. “Anyone who comes into town can see it is difficult. But if you just think the town centre is over, you are never going to recover from that,” says Chris Cooke, the mayor of Middlesbrough. “What we didn’t do was abandon it and clear everything for hotels. It takes much more to make a proper, well thought out strategy.” Mark Robinson, chair of the government-backed High Streets Task Force and co-founder of developer Ellandi, says he believes some Debenhams sites are “going to be empty for quite some time” as there is little demand for new retail or leisure and converting to alternative uses generally requires public funding. He said it was not surprising that it had been difficult to fill Debenhams stores because many of the sites are fairly modern buildings that are “riddled with asbestos”, while the group had expanded rapidly under its private equity owners into buildings that had lengthy leases and unaffordable rents. Finding an alternative use for these sites is also trickier than it first seemed. While some owners or local authorities had planned to convert department store sites into much-needed homes, the increased cost of construction and finance mean the economics no longer stacks up in many places. The chunky shape of department stores also means they are not easy to adapt for residential because it is hard to get light into the centre of the building. New building regulations, which demand certain levels of energy efficiency, and delays in the planning system across the country, only add to the complexity and cost of reinventing the buildings, according to Jonathan Wallace at planning consultancy Lichfields, which has advised on a number of department store reinventions. He says many local authorities are keen to see these key buildings redeveloped but can face a battle with owners who do not wish to take a cut in the value of their asset or accept that no major retailer is going to take their site. In areas including Bristol, Leicester and Northampton, Debenhams sites are being razed to make way for flats or student accommodation – but that has caused local controversy in some cases because of fears of overbearing high-rises in the city centre. “There are a lot of ideas out there but it takes a long time to go from an idea to a scheme and then get planning and come out the other side,” Wallace says. Robinson says the way government money is allotted to town centre development needs a complete overhaul so that local decision makers can direct funds to where it is really needed in order to speed up redevelopment. “We have got to stop the Mad Max-style competition for funds and it has got to be devolved. Information is always more local than Whitehall,” he says. Middlesbrough’s mayor Cooke agrees that the government funding system needs an overhaul so that it does not just focus on large capital sums for buildings or renovations but bears in mind the need for ongoing revenue to keep a project running. He says, for example, that the town could have used £20m in levelling up funds to build “a lovely brand new library but we wouldn’t be able to staff it”. “My major plea to government is that they absolutely focus not on just giving money to have a big number but with a revenue stream attached so we can deliver the projects,” he adds. Despite the difficulties, he insists that Middlesbrough’s plan is working. The council has bought a local shopping mall and changed it into a more leisure-based centre and is hoping to put a health and community centre into another mall. It filled its once-empty BHS with upmarket chain Flannels, attracted more independents and new arrivals include a Wendy’s burger bar, and a soft play centre is set to occupy the former Wilko. Wallace from Lichfields says this kind of mix will be the way forward for many towns: “In the 1950s town centres had much more of a mix of uses. Then retail came along in the 80s and dominated it by the 90s. From a historical perspective, town centres are going back to where they were 70 or 80 years ago.” “We are giving people another reason to come to town – wellbeing, leisure, to work and to live, to visit and stay,” says McPhee. “It’s about education. A lot of local people are like – ‘It’s not got a Debenhams and an M&amp;S’, but most towns don’t have that now.”",

        "title": "Virgin Australia delays vote on controversial enterprise agreement that would cut pilots’ days off ",
        "content": "Virgin Australia has made a last-minute decision to delay putting a controversial pilots’ enterprise deal to vote, after outcry about its plan to cut days off and concerns that pilot rostering was nearing unsafe limits. The decision comes as Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Casa) officials flagged they were aware of fatigue concerns over Virgin Australia’s pilot rostering after the Guardian revealed internal disquiet on the issue among senior pilots and frustration at what they felt was an inadequate response from management. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Matthew Bouttell, the executive manager of Casa’s regulatory oversight division, told a Senate estimates hearing last month “there has been adjustments to [Virgin’s] roster where they’re getting closer to the limits of that fatigue risk management system”. Some pilots alleged they are routinely rostered to work maximum shift lengths – 12 hours and longer in the event of delays – on back-to-back days, while allowing for just the legal minimum rest period of 12 hours. Bouttell added that, in a recent 28-day pilot roster period, 45 crew removed themselves from duty due to fatigue – just under 5% of pilots at the airline. Casa later released a statement tempering the concern raised in Bouttell’s comments about rostering closer to approved anti-fatigue limits. It insisted Virgin was still operating on the safe side of the limits. However, Casa said “we are engaging with Virgin Australia on [fatigue] claims raised through the media”. Guardian Australia previously reported concerns from pilots that self-reporting fatigue can lead to less pay if they refuse a shift. Pilots have also expressed anger at outdated roster software which they claim has not been replaced despite a promise to do so by the owners of the airline, private equity firm Bain Capital. The frustrations and fatigue concerns have laid the groundwork for tense negotiations over pilots’ new enterprise deal. Virgin Australia and the Transport Workers’ Union (TWU) have been in a standoff over a proposal from the airline to strip pilots of six days’ annual leave. Under Virgin pilots’ existing enterprise agreement, which lapses at the end of June, pilots are entitled to 12 days off every 28-day roster period, of which there are 13 periods a year. For the new deal, Virgin Australia had been proposing that for six of the 13 roster periods, days off would be cut to 11. As part of the proposed deal – which has been agreed with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, a union which represents a majority of pilots at Virgin – pilots would receive a 9.38% pay rise in the first year, and 3% rises in the second and third years, in return for the loss of the six days off. The airline had initially dismissed the results of a TWU survey which found that of 180 pilot respondents, 93% intended to vote no to the proposed deal. However, after a series of “roadshow” town hall-style sessions with pilots over the past week, the airline has delayed the access period – a seven-day period before an enterprise agreement can be voted on – which had been due to start on Friday. “Discussions with our pilots during Enterprise Agreement (EA) roadshows this week have been valuable and constructive. We listen actively in these discussions and wherever we can, within the bounds of the existing pay offer, take on board the feedback,” a Virgin Australia spokesperson said. “Based on the feedback from our pilot team, there are a few small points with respect to the documentation which we are considering before we release the final EA document and commence the voting process.” Virgin is expected to finalise its enterprise agreement and commence the access period next week. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said this was “a positive turnaround from Virgin” and its owners, Bain. “Pilots have raised their voices on fatiguing rosters and the need to maintain their days off after the promise of a new rostering system was abandoned,” he said. “Virgin must return to the table and fix these outstanding issues to reach an agreement worth voting for,” he said.",

        "title": "Supermarket sandwich suppliers issue recall amid UK E coli outbreak",
        "content": "The sandwich maker Greencore, which supplies big supermarkets including Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s, is one of a number of companies recalling products after being potentially linked to an outbreak of E coli that has caused cases in the UK to almost double to more than 200. The company is recalling thousands of sandwiches, wraps and salads sold through those three supermarkets as well as Boots, Aldi, Amazon and the Co-op. The 45 products contain a certain variety of salad leaf linked to the outbreak identified this month by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Another company, Samworth Brothers, which supplies Tesco and its One Stop convenience store chain from its Manton Wood business, is recalling 15 kinds of sandwiches, wraps and subs for the same reason. A further manufacturer expected to issue a recall has yet to be identified as investigations are continuing into exactly which products may have been affected. News of the recall came as the UKHSA revealed on Friday that a further 98 cases had been linked to the outbreak, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 211, including 147 in England, 27 in Wales, 35 in Scotland and two in Northern Ireland. The agency said at least 67 people had been admitted to hospital. It expected the number affected by the outbreak to rise further as it carried out more research using genome sequencing to check which E coli cases were linked. Sources said the items being recalled were not believed to contain E coli, as the affected batch of salad leaves had now been used up, but customers and retailers were being asked to return the items as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said sandwich manufacturers were taking “a precautionary measure” to recall various sandwiches, wraps and salads in response to findings from investigations into the “ongoing outbreak” of shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec). Darren Whitby, the FSA’s head of incidents, said: “This is a complex investigation, and we have worked swiftly with the relevant businesses and the local authorities concerned to narrow down the wide range of foods consumed to a small number of salad leaf products that have been used in sandwiches and wraps. Following thorough food chain analysis, these products are being recalled as a precaution. “Infections caused by Stec bacteria can cause severe bloody diarrhoea and, in some cases, more serious complications. We therefore advise any consumers who have any of these products not to eat them.” Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: “Food safety is the highest priority for our members and those who sell or prepare food are well versed in food safety measures. “Retailers affected are taking swift action to remove these products from sale and are working closely with the Food Standards Agency to take any further action needed to minimise risk to their customers.” The Greencore recall covers 45 different products, including Asda’s chicken and bacon club sandwich, Boots’s BLT, Asda’s tuna crunch sub roll and Sainsbury’s peri peri chicken wrap. The Samworth Brothers recall covers 15 items including a Tesco chicken salad sandwich and a One Stop tuna crunch sub. Earlier this month, the UKHSA said 113 recent UK cases of E coli since 25 May were thought to be part of a single outbreak, which was likely to be linked to a “nationally distributed food item or multiple food items” owing to the wide geographic spread of cases. Supermarkets were issuing notices asking shoppers who had bought any of the affected products not to eat them but to return them to a store where they would be given a full refund. Greencore said in a statement: “As a precautionary measure, we have voluntarily recalled a number of sandwiches and wraps due to a potential food safety risk. “Greencore adheres to the highest standards of food safety, and we are working closely with the Food Standards Agency and our suppliers to better understand the possible source of any potential issue.”",

        "title": "French stock market plummets amid fears of far right election win",
        "content": "France’s stock market is heading for its biggest weekly fall in more than two years, amid fears that the country’s far-right party could win the upcoming parliamentary elections. French bonds were also hammered this week, as analysts warned of the risk of a Liz Truss-style market panic following Emmanuel Macron’s shock decision last Sunday to call snap national assembly elections. The CAC 40 index of the largest 40 stocks listed in Paris has had its worst week since March 2022. It fell by 2.7% on Friday, taking its losses for the week to over 6%. Friday’s selloff came after France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the country could risk a financial crisis if either the far right or left won the coming parliamentary election, because of their heavy spending pledges. “When I look at the far right, I see a programme that is made of lies,” Le Maire told franceinfo radio. The far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, has previously called for protectionist economic policies and proposed higher public spending, as well as lower VAT on fuel, electricity and gas. Le Maire also claimed that a new alliance of left-wing parties would cause “economic collapse” if it won power. France is aiming to bring down its budget deficit to 3% by 2027, to meet the maximum borrowing allowed under eurozone rules. Increased government spending, or tax cuts, could undermine that push. Asked whether the current political instability could lead to a financial crisis, Le Maire said “yes”. “This is because of the political programmes that are on the table with regard to the question if we will be able, yes or no, to keep financing this debt,” he added. The gap between France and Germany’s borrowing costs has widened to a seven-year high this week, as investors sold French bonds – pushing down prices, which lifted the yield, or interest rate, on the debt. This spread measures the premium that investors demand for lending to Paris, rather than the traditional safe haven of Berlin. The last time this gap was wider was in 2017, shortly before Macron defeated Le Pen in the presidential elections that year. A poll this week showed that National Rally was on track to win the snap election and claim a third of the vote, ahead of France’s leftwing bloc, which is forecast to take 22%, and Macron’s centrists with 19% of the vote. Heavy losses for centrist candidates would almost certainly spell the end of Macron’s pro-growth reforms, warned Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. A hung parliament could lead to gridlock, he said. “However, if Le Pen calls the shots in parliament and pursues major parts of her expensive fiscal and protectionist ‘France first’ agenda, the result could be a Liz Truss-style financial crisis. At the moment, we rate this as a serious risk, not as a forecast,” Schmieding added. If National Rally won power in the French National Assembly, France would be in a “cohabitation” scenario; Macron would remain president and Jordan Bardella of National Rally would probably become prime minister.",

        "content": "And finally…. France’s stock market has ended a choppy week, deep in the red. The CAC 40 stock index fell 2.7% today, taking its losses this week to over 6%, as worries over the upcoming national assembly elections revive market memories of the UK budget rout of 2022. The premium charged for lending to France, over Germany, remains at a seven-year high too (see earlier post for details). As Bob Savage of BNY Mellon puts it: The biggest story of the week is in France post the EU parliamentary vote and the Macron snap election call. The spread between German and French bonds is up 27 basis points in the week back to 2017 highs – trading 95bps today. The FinMin LeMaire warns of a financial crisis. More here: And here’s the rest of today’s business news: Both th US dollar and the gold price have rallied today. The dollar is up agains tthe euro and the pound, while gold has gained around 1% to $2,320 per ounce. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, explains: The dollar’s strength came primarily because of a weaker euro, which tumbled to below the $1.07 handle amid ongoing political turmoil in France – something which also hurt European indices and undermined other risk-sensitive currencies. Europe’s mainland indices were showing losses of 1.5% to 3.2%. The resulting risk-off trade further boosted the appeal of the precious metal as the spread between French and German 10-year government bonds continued to widen. The chairman of Tesco told investors today he had “no difficulty” defending the £10m pay packet awarded to CEO Ken Murphy. Gerry Murphy (no relation) told today’s AGM: “I have no difficulty in defending Ken’s absolute level of pay given the complexity (and) scale of the business, but also particularly its performance. “We do recruit from time to time at very senior levels from the global market and frankly we just have to be competitive with that market.” The sandwich maker Greencore, which supplies big supermarkets including Tesco, is one of a number of companies recalling products after being potentially linked to a recent UK outbreak of E coli that caused dozens of people to be hospitalised. It is understood that the company, which also supplies Asda and Sainsbury’s, is recalling thousands of items, including at least 30 different sandwiches and wraps containing a certain variety of salad leaf linked to the outbreak identified this month by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The other manufacturers issuing recalls have yet to be identified as investigations are ongoing into exactly which products have been affected. Sources said the items being recalled were not believed to contain E coli, as the batch of leaves affected has now been used up, but customers and retailers are being asked to return the items as a precaution. More here. Norwegian energy giant Equinor has suspended efforts to sell a stake in the giant Rosebank oil development in the UK North Sea due to fiscal uncertainty ahead of next month’s general election, sources close to the matter have told Reuters. In its manifesto, the Labour Party has pledged not to issue new licences to explore new fields in the North Sea, arguing that more drilling there would not cut bills and would accelerate the climate crisis. The Conservatives, though, are pledging to conduct annual licensing rounds of oil and gas production in the North Sea. Just in: US consumers are gloomier than expected this month, according to the University of Michigan’s latest sentiment report, just released. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu says: Sentiment is currently about 31% above the trough seen in June 2022 amid the escalation in inflation. Assessments of personal finances dipped, due to modestly rising concerns over high prices as well as weakening incomes. Overall, consumers perceive few changes in the economy from May. Back in the UK, Tesco’s shareholders have approved all the resolutions at its AGM today. Just 6.5% of votes were cast against the remuneration report, vs 93.5% in favour, despite the concerns over CEO Ken Murphy’s £10m pay packet (see opening post). European markets remain on the back foot today, says Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets. Soaring borrowing costs are already hitting the French government, as the perceived risk attached to a potential victory for the Far Right pushed the cost of sovereign debt higher. Comments from the French Finance minister over the potential financial crisis could be a potential warning sign to the electorate, but it also sends a message to the market which has clearly been heard. Defense stocks have been hit by the rise in support for the far right in Europe, Reuters reports. Shares in Rheinmetall, which makes artillery shells and military vehicles, are down almost 5% today, while the UK’s BAE Systems are down 2.8%. Reuters reports that ODDO BHF analyst Yann Derocles has suggested that Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ Social Democratic Party’s poor performance in the recent European elections weaken his position, making the governing coalition’s negotiations over the defence budget more difficult. The anxiety in European stock markets today extends beyond Paris. Italy’s FTSE MIB has had a rough day too, down 2.7%, while Germany’s DAX has dropped by 1.2%. In London, though, the FTSE 100 is basically flat. This week’s share selloff puts France at risk of losing its crown as the largest equity market in Europe, reports Bloomberg. They add: The euro is the worst-performing major currency this week against the dollar. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire added to the jitters in the markets today, by warning of the risk of a financial crisis if the far right were to win snap elections in the coming weeks. Le Maire told franceinfo radio early this morning that: “When I look at the far right, I see a program that is made of lies,” And he urged voters instead to back President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist party’s candidates. Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) party has promised to cut electricity prices, and lower the VAT on petrol, and increase public spending on services such as health. Ouch. The selloff in Paris is gathering pace, sending the Cac40 index down by 2.3% today. Politicial uncertainty is hurting stocks, with investors anxious that Emmanual Macron’s centrists could lose badly in the upcoming parliamentary elections, spelling the end of pro-growth reforms. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, suggests the consequences could be more wide-ranging, and suggests three potential scenarios: France ends up with a hung parliament in which neither the far right nor the united left nor Macron’s centrists call the shots. Amid gridlock, not much would get done, but no major reforms might be reversed either. The required fiscal consolidation would become even more difficult. At the EU level, further progress towards capital markets union, common defence projects, EU enlargement and other initiatives may stall. That would be unfortunate, but probably just about bearable. Marine Le Pen and her allies can determine the shape of the next government, and of fiscal and economic policies. However, if Le Pen then focusses on her main goal, winning the 2027 presidential election, she might still choose to not rock the boat too badly, concentrating on some signature policies (eg being tough on immigration) rather than on expensive or disruptive promises. If so, the result may be close to the first scenario: no more reform progress, but only a few damaging reversals. However, if Le Pen calls the shots in parliament and pursues major parts of her expensive fiscal and protectionist “France first” agenda, the result could be a Liz Truss-style financial crisis. At the moment, we rate this as a serious risk, not as a forecast. It’s also been a strong week for the pound against the euro. Sterling is on track for its biggest weekly gain against the euro in nearly seven months on Friday, up almost 1% since Monday morning. That would be the best performance since the last week of November 2023. The pound is trading at €1.1887 The gap between French and German borrowing costs has blown out to its highest level in seven years this morning. Investors are piling into safe-haven German debt today, amid anxiety over the French parliamentary elections. French bond prices tumbled on Monday, after president Macron called snap elections. There’s been a modest recovery since, but not enough to repair the damage. In contrast, German bund prices are rising today, which pushes down the yield (or interst rates on the bond). So, while German 10-year bunds are trading at a yield of 2.37% today, the French equivalent is 3.25%. Ad this chart shows, this is the biggest gap between Paris and Berlin’s borrowing costs since 2017. Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, explains: For reference, the last time it was this wide in 2017 came just before the first round of the presidential election that year, when Macron came first and set up a run-off in the second round against Marine Le Pen. Then spreads tightened again after Macron’s first-round win, as markets moved to price in a strong likelihood of a Macron presidency. The real concern unfolding is an outright election victory for Marine Le Pen’s RN party in the parliamentary elections, and a move away from the EU’s fiscal rules, says Chris Weston, Head of Research at Pepperstone. If there was fresh fiscal indiscipline (spending rises or tax cuts), France’s credit rating could be in focus once again. Weston explains: It is also worth considering that Le Pen is unlikely to go too hard on unfunded spending measures, as a blowout in the deficit could be taken in a similar light to the disastrous Liz Truss budget in 2022 and result in bond yields on French debt spiking, which would increase interest costs at a time when debt/GDP is looking like it might head towards 140% by 2040. It would also almost certainly lead to ratings agency Moody’s cutting France’s sovereign credit rating, joining Fitch and S&amp;P who have already done so. Over in Paris, shares are falling again today as political uncertainty continues to hit the French stock market. The Cac40 index of the largest companies listed in Paris has fallen by 1.7% so far today, taking its losses this week over 5%. Stocks have been hit by Emmanual Macron’s shock decision last Sunday to all snap parliamentary elections, which could lead to a win for the far-right National Rally (RN). Investors fear there could be “policymaking paralysis” if RN held a majority in parliament, leading to a “cohabitation” scenario in which the President is from a different political party to the Prime Minister. The BoE’s latest Inflation Attitudes Survey also found a small drop in inflation expectations – although prices are still expected to rise faster than its 2% target. The survey shows the public expects inflation of 2.8% next year (vs 3.0% one quarter ago) and 2.6% in two years (vs 2.8% one quarter ago). Professor Costas Milas, of the management school at University of Liverpool, tells us these are “very disappointing data on public inflation expectations”. He explains: These expectations matter because they set the tone for wage increases and therefore impact on future inflation. The BoE sets interest rates with the aim of hitting the 2% target two years ahead. From the Chart below, the correlation between the Bank’s base rate and public expectations of inflation two years ahead is only 0.16. Today’s data are quite disappointing and definitely point to no interest rate action this month, to say the least... The UK public are increasingly keen for the Bank of England to lower interest rates to help the economy. The BoE’s latest Inflation Attitudes Survey, released this morning, shows that 42% of people polled thought it would be best for the economy for borrowing costs to come down. That’s a small increase on February’s 41%, and – Reuters points out – the highest reading since 2008. In contrast, 10% of people thought higher rates would help the economy. When asked what would be ‘best for you personally’, 24% of respondents said it would be better for them if interest rates were to ‘go up’, up from 23% in February, 31% of respondents said it would be better for them if interest rates were to ‘go down’, down from 32% in February 2024. The CEO of the firm behind Netflix hit Bridgerton has opened trading at London Stock Exchange today. Shonda Rhimes is in the City, to mark the return of Bridgerton to UK TV screens – with Netflix claiming that the Regency-style drama (now on its third season) has boosted the UK economy by £275m. Bridgerton, which is produced by Rhimes’s company Shondaland, has supported 5,000 local businesses over the past five years, Netflix reports. The show has been filmed at many beautiful locations across the UK. Rhimes says: The Bridgerton universe occupies a special space in culture, resonating with young and old alike, creating conversation, starting trends and influencing everything from baby names to weddings. “The shows have also had a seismic impact on the UK economy, boosting it by a quarter of a billion pounds over the last five years and supporting thousands of jobs and businesses. “It is clear that the business of art and culture can make a huge economic contribution to local communities. I could not be prouder.” Julia Hoggett, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, said she was “thrilled to celebrate the significant economic and cultural impact” of the film and creative industries in the UK. Shares in Tesco have jumped 1.9% this morning, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Traders seem pleased with its Q1 results this morning, in which the company reiterates its guidance for the full year. That includes making retail adjusted operating profit of at least £2.8bn this year, slightly higher than the £2.76bn in 2023/24. Chris Beckett, head of equity research at Quilter Cheviot, says: Tesco has reiterated its guidance for flat profits, but we see this as somewhat conservative. Management is doing well, while private equity owned supermarkets – Asda and Morrisons – struggle as priorities are very different. Tesco has a good opportunity to take advantage of these trends especially as inflation continues to ease and disposable incomes recover.” In the City, shares in UK housebuilder Crest Nicholson have jumped over 9% after it rebuffed a takeover approach from rival Bellway. Crest told shareholders this morning that Bellway’s £650m all-share takeover offer “significantly undervalued” the group, and it had rejected it last month. Bellway’s proposal implies a value of 253p per Crest share, or almost 19% above last night’s closing price of 213p. This morning, Crest has jumped to 232p. Last night, Bellway declared there is “compelling strategic and financial rationale” for combining the two businesses. Bellway’s shares are down 3% this morning, which will reduce the value of its bid. The defence for Ken Murphy’s £10m pay packet is that he’s doing a good job running Tesco, and has earned the bonuses that helped to double his take-home pay. Today’s Q1 results from Tesco could bolster that argument, given it is adding to its market share. John Moore, senior investment manager at wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin, says: “Tesco is a strong business that only appears to be getting stronger. This latest set of positive results should stand the supermarket giant in good stead to achieve its target of £70 billion in revenue this year and, importantly, this is helping the bottom line. Market share is growing faster than competitors and it continues to hold the top – or bottom – spot on price. Simplification of the business is a major part of the success story, with the decision to sell Tesco Bank and reduce the share count through buybacks allowing for additional focus and investment in the core business – a stark contrast to other supermarkets such as Asda and Morrisons which are not in a position to do the same.” Tesco CEO Ken Murphy has also told reporters that the supermarket chain expects a gentle improvement in consumer sentiment in Britain, and sees food inflation in the low single digits for the rest of the year Murphy explained: “Our sense is that there is a gentle improvement, ongoing improvement in customer sentiment.” Murphy is also looking for ‘stability and consistency’ from any new UK government (here’s hoping, Ken!), and says he’s not “unduly worried” by the employment measures in the Labour Party’s manifesto, Getting back to Tesco, it has also reported a jump in sales this morning. In its financial results for the first quarter of the financial year, Tesco says UK like-for-like sales rose by 4.6% in the three months to 26 May. Tesco says it is growing its UK market share faster than all its “key competitors”, with food sales up 5% in the quarter. CEO Ken Murphy (he of the controversial £10m pay packet) says: “We’ve continued to build momentum in the business, with strong volume growth across the UK, Republic of Ireland and Central Europe supported by easing inflation. We continue to be the cheapest full-line grocer and are the most competitive we’ve ever been, with our value, product quality and service driving better brand perception and customer satisfaction Not all Tesla shareholders will share Musk’s jubilation, though. Some, including Norway’s $1.6 trillion sovereign wealth fund and Californian pension fund CalPERS, had said they would vote against the pay deal. And impact fund Tulipshare is disappointed that its proposal to tie CEO Elon Musk’s compensation to ESG performance was not accepted. Antoine Argouges, CEO and founder of Tulipshare, says he is “deeply concerned” that Musk’s pay deal was reapproved. “Once again, Tesla has chosen to bypass shareholder concerns at this year’s annual general meeting (AGM). Although Tulipshare did not secure majority shareholder support for our proposal to link CEO Elon Musk’s pay package to the company’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, we remain committed to our engagement with Tesla. “As a shareholder, I am deeply concerned that Musk’s compensation package has been reinstated. I see this move as shortsighted and one that will have detrimental consequences for Tesla’s future. It is imperative for the longevity of the company that Musk’s compensation be tied not only to financial performance indicators but also to ESG metrics, as our resolution suggested. Tesla’s future cannot be predicated on Musk’s erratic behavior and decision-making alone; there must be safeguards put in place to ensure the company’s long term financial stability and sustainability efforts. Musk should not be rewarded for declining earnings. Tesla’s situation has changed from 2018 and the CEO’s compensation package must reflect that. “Tesla’s poor handling of environmental, social, and governance issues has attracted notable criticism in recent years. In 2021, the National Labor Relations Board revealed that Tesla violated federal labor laws by terminating a union activist. Dozens of workers have also sued the company, alleging that Tesla enables a culture of racism and sexual harassment. Furthermore, Tesla has been battling allegations of child labor in its supply chains for years, as well as alleged improper hazardous waste handling, poor right to repair policies and its failure to develop a low-carbon strategy. Legal experts are cautioning that it is not clear if the Delaware court that blocked the Musk pay deal will accept the re-vote and allow the company to restore the pay package. Mathieu Shapiro, a managing partner at law firm Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell &amp; Hippel, argued (via the BBC): “The vote changes nothing. It only offers Tesla opportunities to try to use the vote to obtain a better decision going forward.” Elon Musk owes his shareholder victory, in part, to the army of small investors who own Tesla stock. Many were vocal in their support for his huge pay deal – in which Musk earned 12 different tranches of stock options after hitting revenue and market targets, and growing the Tesla share price (it’s up 1,100% over the last five years). One, Alexandra Merz, had told fellow investors: Your votes will help to remedy a true injustice. And it’s just the beginning. Don’t mess with Tesla Retail Shareholders. Merz also credited Tesla chair Robyn Denholm, who had warned that Musk might step back from the company if he lost the payout. Elon Musk is in jubilant mood after winning a victory last night over his pay deal currently valued at around $46bn. After shareholders reapproved the mega package, Musk posted a photo of a cake, on with “Vox Populi, Vox Dei”, and a heart, has been written. Tesla’s CEO says he’s sending it to Delaware – where a judge had blocked the payout back in January, prompting Thursday’s fresh vote to approve it (again). The voice of the people may well be the voice of God, but whether the Almighty would approve of a near-$50bn pay deal is quite another matter. Musk hailed his shareholders last night, telling a crowd of investors at the Tesla factory in Austin, Texas: “We have the most awesome shareholder base. Hot damn, I love you guys.” Investors also approved a second resolution, to reincorporate the electric-vehicle maker in Texas. Back in January, a Delaware judge ruled that Tesla’s board could not be considered independent from Musk’s influence and that the process of drawing up the pay package had been illegitimate. Last night’s vote could serve as a rebuttal to the judge’s ruling that struck down the award – making it easier for Tesla’s board to argue that shareholders were properly informed about the payment package, and the board members’ ties to Musk, before casting their votes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Pay packets are in the spotlight today. While Elon Musk celebrates Tesla shareholders voting to approve his multibillion dollar pay packet, UK supermarket chain Tesco will face criticism over its CEO’s wage deal today. Tesco must justify Ken Murphy’s £10m pay package at its AGM later today, with responsible investment NGO ShareAction planning to questioning why Murphy’s pay should double when contracted workers at its supermarket are poorly paid. Although Tesco’s store workers get the voluntary Real Living Wage (which is higher than the minimum wage), ShareAction say contracted staff – such as cleaners and security – don’t Dan Howard, Head of Good Work at ShareAction, explains: “In a world where Tesco are making a £2.3 billion profit a year, paying those who keep the stores safe and clean the real Living Wage shouldn’t have to be asked for – it should be automatic. “Unfortunately, Tesco are dragging their feet on taking the right steps to pay its third-party contracted staff the living wage. “Failing to recognise the financial hardship many of those who work for Tesco have faced during the cost-of-living crisis will damage Tesco’s reputation with both shareholders and customers.” We learned last month that Murphy’s pay had swelled from below £5m to £10m, due to bonus payouts. It means Murphy now earns more than 430 times the average pay at Tesco, up from a multiple of 197 in the previous year. The payout was blasted by the Unite trade union in May; they called it “a slap in the face” to millions of struggling households who paid for it through higher food bills. ShareAction is urging major supermarkets including Tesco to accredit as Living Wage employers, which would mean all staff including third-party contractors would be guaranteed the real Living Wage on an ongoing basis, and to set out a timeline for doing this. Tesco will face questions over Murphy’s pay, and other aspects of the business, at its AGM which begins at 11.30am at its Welwyn Garden City campus.

        "title": "Jaguar Land Rover to spend £1m to help police stop car thefts",
        "content": "Jaguar Land Rover is planning to invest more than £1m to support UK police to fight car thefts and fund intelligence gathering. The luxury carmaker said the money would be used to target theft hotspots and provide police forces “with additional dedicated resources to respond to vehicle thefts across the country”. The investment comes as the JLR chief executive, Adrian Mardell, called on ministers to increase spending on policing after the Range Rover maker was hit by a wave of thefts of its luxury vehicles. JLR said it would work directly with forces across the UK, who would determine how to spend the money based on intelligence, the Guardian understands. Insurance premiums for the company’s luxury vehicles have soared recently, prompting it to relaunch its own insurance cover last October. Some insurers have refused to cover Range Rovers. The Jaguar Land Rover UK managing director, Patrick McGillycuddy, said: “We are constantly developing our systems and security features and through our close collaboration with police, we stay ahead of any emerging methods and quickly deploy anti-theft measures. “This additional investment, coupled with our other ongoing and proactive action, shows our commitment to supporting the authorities in having a tangible impact on combating this issue in the UK.” JLR said it was already working with police to share information, helping to recover stolen vehicles and providing training for 650 officers, as well as working to make its vehicles less vulnerable. Of the 12,800 vehicles of the latest Range Rover sold since its launch in January 2022, only 11 were stolen during its first two years on the market. But some customers are seeing the cost of insuring their Range Rovers skyrocketing. Meryl Cabellos told BBC News that the cost of insuring his car increased from £2,000 to £4,000 last year, before receiving a best quote of £10,000 this year. “We’ve been Range Rover customers for many years, and it really feels as though we’re being priced out now,” Cabellos said. “We’re just really disappointed. We loved the car but because of the insurance the experience of owning it went downhill so quick.” According to Auto Trader data, the average price of a used Range Rover has fallen 9.3% since May to £35,224, compared with declines of 5.7% for all luxury SUVs and 2.8% for all cars. JLR, which is owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata, says it is spending more than £15m updating 450,000 older vehicles with new security software, and has installed it on 80,000 so far. It made a profit before tax and exceptional items of £627m in its third quarter, the three months to 31 December, up from £235m a year earlier. Sales rose to £7.4bn from £6bn, as wholesale revenues of its Range Rover – vehicles sold through dealerships – hit a quarterly record.",

        "title": "US bank Wells Fargo fires employees for ‘simulating’ being at their keyboards",
        "content": "The US bank Wells Fargo has fired more than a dozen workers for alleged “simulation of keyboard activity”, in an apparent attempt to fool their employer into thinking they were working. The employees were “discharged after review of allegations involving simulation of keyboard activity creating impression of active work”, according to a filing with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The filing, reported by Bloomberg, does not disclose whether the staff in question were using home or office computers. Wells Fargo indicates on its website that it embraces flexible working, stating that many of its corporate roles give staff the opportunity to “work from home on some days and at the office on others”. A company spokesperson said: “Wells Fargo holds employees to the highest standards and does not tolerate unethical behaviour.” Devices or software used to simulate computer mouse activity, known as mouse movers or mouse jigglers, are widely available on Amazon for less than £10, and many of them claim that they are “undetectable”. Designed to prevent computers from entering sleep mode, the devices work by placing the mouse on a platform or disc that rotates to imitate normal movement, while the software runs a program that moves a mouse around. Just over a quarter of paid working days in the US last month were work-from-home days, according to WFH Research, which surveys 20- to 64-year-olds. The pre-Covid figure was 5%, according to WFH, which is run by academics from a group of universities in the US and Mexico. Major banks have been among the employers taking a tough approach on working from home. In January, Bank of America sent “letters of education” to staff threatening disciplinary action over failure to show up at the office, while Goldman Sachs said in a memo to staff last year that it encouraged employees to “work in the office five days a week”. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, told the Economist last year that employees who did not want to commute to the office could find a job elsewhere. “I completely understand why someone doesn’t want to commute an hour and a half every day, totally got it. Doesn’t mean they have to have a job here either,” he said. The issue of workplace monitoring became more prominent during the Covid epidemic, which triggered a wave of work-from-home orders around the world. In 2020, Microsoft apologised for using software that singled out individuals and assigned them a “productivity score” based on emails sent and meetings attended. Last year the British thinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research called workplace surveillance “dystopian”, claiming that it disproportionately targeted minorities as well as female and younger workers. Jennifer Abruzzo, the general counsel of the US National Labour Relations Board, said in a 2022 memo that she was worried about keystroke monitoring software being used by some employers in order to discourage workers from unionising.",

        "content": "The UK’s biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, faced criticism over its chief executive’s near-£10m pay deal at its annual shareholder meeting on Friday. The campaign groups ShareAction and the High Pay Centre both questioned why Ken Murphy’s pay had more than doubled to £9.9m including bonuses, when some of those working in its supermarkets do not receive the real living wage. “Can the board explain why it is comfortable with chief executive pay doubling last year to 430 times [that of the] average employee and not comfortable with providing third-party contracted workers such as cleaners and security guards with the real living wage,” Peter, a Share Action activist, asked at the meeting. A member of the High Pay Centre said Murphy’s pay in relation to ordinary workers was “one of the most extreme pay ratios in the FTSE 100”. Although the majority of store workers get the independently verified living wage – which is higher than the legal minimum – ShareAction claims contracted staff, such as cleaners and security, do not. Murphy said on Friday: “I accept I am well paid. My remuneration is set by the board as delegated by shareholders. Over two-thirds of it is variable and dependent on reaching long-term financial goals.” He added that Tesco had made “record investments” in pay for ordinary workers over the past two years. He said he was “really proud of [the] fact we are a leading employer in terms of our total package for colleagues” and that Tesco was “not unduly worried” by Labour’s plans for improved workers’ rights as it already had in place many of the measures expected to be implemented if the party wins power. Gerry Murphy, Tesco’s chairman, later told the annual shareholder meeting that the company was recruiting in a global market for executives and “the fact is we have to be competitive”. However, Dan Howard, the head of good work at ShareAction, said: “In a world where Tesco are making a £2.3bn profit a year, paying those who keep the stores safe and clean the real living wage shouldn’t have to be asked for – it should be automatic. “Unfortunately, Tesco are dragging their feet on taking the right steps to pay its third-party contracted staff the living wage. “Failing to recognise the financial hardship many of those who work for Tesco have faced during the cost of living crisis will damage Tesco’s reputation with both shareholders and customers.” On Friday, Tesco, which owns the Booker wholesaler and supermarkets in Ireland and mainland Europe as well as UK supermarkets and convenience stores, said it continued to win over shoppers from its rivals with sales up 5.3% at its UK chain and 4.5% overall. Murphy said inflation was continuing to ease and was now less than 3%. He added that he expected it to remain at that level for the remainder of the year despite a rise in shipping costs, linked to problems in the Red Sea, and poor weather in the UK and Europe, which is affecting crops. He said the British strawberry season had been delayed and the asparagus season had been shorter than hoped but there were no shortages as Tesco had made “alternative arrangements”. Murphy added there was a “gentle ongoing improvement in customer sentiment” in the UK helped by a rise in the legal minimum wage that was ahead of inflation. However, he admitted that sales of nonfood items were weaker than food as the wet and cold weather continued to affect demand for summer clothing, barbecue kit and other seasonal items.",

        "content": "Crest Nicholson, the embattled housebuilder, has rebuffed a second all-share takeover approach from its larger rival Bellway valuing the group at about £650m. The FTSE 250 housebuilder this week reported losses in the first half and slashed its dividend in its latest profit warning as it continued to be hit by volatile mortgage rates and slowing demand in the housing market. Crest said in a statement that it had rejected an all-share preliminary proposal from Bellway received on 14 May. The proposal would have resulted in Crest investors receiving 0.093 shares in Bellway for each of their current shares. This would value Crest shares at about 253p – a 19% premium. In a statement Crest said the approach underestimated the value of its future standalone prospects. It confirmed it had rejected an earlier all-share approach from Bellway on 25 April in which it had proposed Crest investors would receive 0.089 shares in its rival. Bellway said in a separate statement it believed there was “compelling strategic and financial rationale” for a combination of Bellway and Crest Nicholson because of lower indebtedness and a larger landbank. It added that the deal could offer significant operational synergies. Shares in Crest – which have halved over the past three years – jumped by 8% to 230p in early trading. Crest Nicholson has been under pressure after issuing a string of profit warnings in the past year. Its chief executive, Peter Truscott, announced earlier this year he would step down to be replaced by Martyn Clark, who started in the role on Friday. Crest this week reported a pre-tax loss of £30.9m in the six months to the end of April, down from £28.4m in the same period a year earlier. It expects to make an adjusted pre-tax profit of £22m-£29m for the full financial year, below analyst forecasts of almost £39m. The latest approach by Bellway comes as housebuilders battle a challenging market while homebuyers struggle with higher mortgage rates. Confidence in the UK’s housing market has begun to falter as interest rate cuts are not now expected until much later this year. There has already been consolidation in the housebuilding sector. Barratt, the UK’s biggest housebuilder, proposed a £2.5bn all-share acquisition of its smaller rival Redrow earlier this year. The merged group Barratt Redrow is expected to build 23,000 homes a year and have a turnover of more than £7bn. Legal &amp; General is also in the process of marketing Cala Homes, a private homebuilder.",

        "title": "Tesla shareholders approve CEO Elon Musk’s $45bn pay package",
        "content": "Tesla shareholders have approved a $45bn (£35.3bn) pay deal for CEO Elon Musk, following a fiercely contested referendum on his leadership. The result, announced on Thursday, comes as the billionaire tycoon fights to retain the largest-ever compensation package granted to an executive at a US-listed company. “I just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys!” a gleeful Musk said as he appeared on stage following the vote. The vote took place after a Delaware judge nullified Musk’s payment – then worth around $56bn (£43.9)– in January, on the grounds that Tesla’s board could not be considered independent from Musk’s influence and reached that dollar figure through an illegitimate process. The result is a victory for Musk and the Tesla board after they ardently campaigned for shareholders to approve the deal. It could serve as a rebuttal to the judge’s ruling that struck down the award – making it easier for Tesla’s board to argue that shareholders were properly informed about the payment package, and the board members’ ties to Musk, before casting their votes. Tesla’s board warned Musk could turn away from the company if the package wasn’t approved, while Musk claimed on Wednesday evening that he had wide support of investors. Prominent shareholders such as Norway’s sovereign wealth fund and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System announced they would vote against the payment in the lead-up to the vote, while proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services also opposed the award. The vote does not automatically mean that Musk will receive the money, however, and there are likely to be further disputes. There are still numerous legal arguments around whether the board can be considered independent, and whether the package can be considered fair after the judge ruled otherwise. It is also possible new lawsuits may arise over the vote, potentially bringing the case back in front of a judge and raising the prospect of a protracted legal battle. Shareholders also approved a measure to move Tesla’s legal home from Delaware to Texas, potentially further complicating any challenges. Tesla originally devised Musk’s payment package in 2017, setting conditions for the CEO to receive 12 different tranches of stock options depending on whether the company hit certain revenue and market targets. Shareholders approved that package by a wide margin in 2018, but one investor filed a suit claiming that the board had been misleading and the package was unfair. Judge Kathaleen McCormick, who oversees Delaware’s court of chancery, ruled that Tesla’s board conducted a “deeply flawed” process to determine Musk’s payment. McCormick found that the board was rife with personal conflicts and stacked with Musk’s close allies, such as his former divorce attorney. Tesla’s board, which is likely to appeal McCormick’s ruling, sought to remedy her decision with a shareholder vote. Despite McCormick’s criticism of the pay package, the board put forth the same deal that the judge rejected – albeit now worth less money due to a fall in Tesla’s share price.",

Stellantis’s chief executive, Carlos Tavares, has criticised the EU tariffs on imported Chinese cars announced on Wednesday and said the world’s fourth biggest carmaker preferred to “fight to stay competitive”.

Europe’s car industry had been opposed to the tariffs, with German carmakers the most exposed to a trade war as almost a third of their sales came from China last year. “The German industry is very much exposed to Chinese business and this is the reason why Germany is expressing a negative option about those tariffs,” Tavares told journalists after an investor day. He added: “Correcting the tariff is correcting a lack of competitiveness… We prefer to race than to be told that we are going to be protected, because we do not believe that being protected is a long-lasting competitive position for a company like ours. “We are going to fight to be as competitive as we should be in the performance of the products, in the range, in the affordability; we’re going to compete because we are a global company.” Tavares said Stellantis would stick to its “asset-light” strategy in China, focused on exporting to the country rather than manufacturing there. Stellantis was created in 2021 from the €40bn merger between Italy’s Fiat Chrysler and the French owner of Peugeot, PSA. “What is clear is that we don’t want to be defensive,” he told investors in Michigan. “Our strategy, that remains an asset-light strategy, is about making sure that we are ourselves offensive and surfing the wave of the Chinese offensive. Our asset-light strategy in China is much more robust than that of many of our competitors.” Stellantis has bought a 21% stake in the Chinese carmaker Leapmotor and has formed a joint venture with it allowing the European company to sell and manufacture Leapmotor’s vehicles outside China. Stellantis leads the venture with a 51% stake and plans to export two electric vehicle models from China by the end of the year. The new EU tariffs come on top of the existing 10% levy on cars imported into the EU, meaning some Chinese-made electric cars face total tariffs of up to 48%. The tariffs are aimed at countering the alleged state support handed to China’s car manufacturing industry, which has allowed it to sell cars abroad at cheaper prices than those of global rivals. China criticised the EU tariffs on Thursday as protectionist behaviour and said it hoped the European bloc would correct its “wrong practices”. Stellantis shares closed 2.8% lower, similar to other European carmakers, due to uncertainty over how Beijing would respond to the tariffs. Tavares said that at least two of Stellantis’s plants in the US needed “significant turnaround”. “We know what to do,” he said.",

        "title": "Why government debt is not like household borrowing",
        "content": "Politicians have often struggled to explain how governments borrow money to fund their spending. The implications of higher or lower borrowing are also difficult to assess when the figures run into hundreds of billions of pounds. The temptation is to simplify the arguments by comparing the nation’s finances to a household budget or a credit card. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has talked about the Conservatives “maxing out the credit card”, and Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak have also used the analogy. But is it a fair comparison? A group of senior economists think not. They have complained to the BBC about one of its political journalists, Laura Kuenssberg, giving podcast listeners the wrong impression by using the household finance analogy when comparing day-to-day government spending with longer-term capital expenditure. What provoked the row? In a recent edition of the Newscast programme Kuenssberg, the broadcaster’s former political editor, suggested government borrowing was like a mortgage or taking out a credit card. She said: “One of the differences that is very important is the limit on borrowing for different kinds of spending. And just to give people some context, and I know some people object to trying to use metaphors to explain this stuff, I think actually it is quite important so you understand that borrowing for capital spending is a bit like if you took out a mortgage to buy a house or for day-to-day spending you buy loads of new frocks on your credit card: they are not the same kind of spending.” Who else has made the household finances comparison? Margaret Thatcher cited the family budget to defend limits on public spending during her three administrations in the 1980s. In 2008, the former leader of the Conservative party and now foreign secretary, David Cameron, said about Gordon Brown’s administration: “This government has maxed out our nation’s credit card – and they want to keep on spending by getting another.” Starmer said after the March budget that “the national credit card” was “maxed out”. Sunak and Reeves have also used the household analogy. What’s wrong with the comparison? Households have a limit on how much they can borrow because banks and other lenders put a cap on the amount. It means that once they have hit borrowing limits and can no longer afford to pay the interest bill, they tend to fall into arrears and before long creditors call in the debt. Thousands of households declare themselves bankrupt each year for this reason. A review of the BBC’s economics coverage by Andrew Dilnot, a former head of the UK Statistics Authority, said in 2022 that countries also do not “tend to retire or die, or pay off their debts entirely” like households, which is why comparisons with household debt – and suggestions the government must ‘pay off’ or ‘pay down’ the debt – “can cause intense debate”. How do governments borrow? A government has an income, mainly from tax receipts, but unlike a household, it can raise many billions of pounds more in the short term by increasing taxes. If this is not desirable or possible, it can borrow from domestic lenders and international investors. If that is not enough to cover the extra spending, there is another way it can generate income: it can print it. Unlike a UK household, the government has an independent central bank – the Bank of England – and its own currency. During the Covid-19 pandemic the Bank of England bought £450bn of bonds created by the government, in a process known as quantitative easing. These bonds funded about the same amount of spending by the government. The UK currently has a debt to GDP ratio – its total borrowings set against annual output – of 97%. However, it has been much higher, and hit 270% just after the second world war. What do the economists and the BBC say? Kuenssberg’s analogy is alleged to have breached guidance given to the broadcaster by Dilnot. The economists, among them Susan Newman, the head of economics at the Open University, said: “Andrew Dilnot was clear when he said language matters and that analogies between household debt and government debt are ‘dangerous territory, intensely contested, and can easily mislead’.” The BBC said it was “committed to impartiality at all times”. “The thematic review into taxation, public spending, government borrowing and debt was a very important piece of work which provided invaluable insights, and we are committed to implementing its findings.” • This article was amended on 14 June 2024. An earlier version said that the Bank of England had created £450bn of bonds and invited investors to buy them; the government actually created the bonds, which were then bought by the Bank of England.",

        "title": "Carlos Slim: who is the Mexican billionaire who has invested £400m in BT?",
        "content": "Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire who this week paid £400m for a 3% stake in BT, has traversed some of life’s highest peaks and lowest ebbs. He claims that in 1997, aged 57, he was briefly declared dead after suffering a massive haemorrhage on the operating table at the Texas Heart Institute during surgery to replace a faulty heart valve. Thirteen years later he was named the world’s wealthiest man by the American business magazine Forbes, his fortune estimated at $73bn. While Slim, the son of Lebanese immigrants, has fallen off the list of the top 10 richest people in the world amid the rise of tech bros such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, his net worth has swollen to $93bn. What’s more, his investment in BT shows that at the age of 84 he has not lost his renowned appetite for opportunistic investment, swooping on the company’s shares at a time when many analysts are predicting a brighter future under the new chief executive Allison Kirkby. Investors appeared cheered by Slim’s latest move: BT’s shares rose 4% on Thursday. He’s not the only billionaire on the share register: Altice, the group controlled by Moroccan-born telecoms mogul Patrick Drahi, is its largest shareholder. BT and Slim seem a good fit. The Slim empire was founded on telecoms, in particular América Móvil, which secured a virtual monopoly on the telephone business in Mexico, a country of more than 100 million people. But Slim also has interests in a sprawling array of sectors, including manufacturing, retail, energy and aviation. Many of his investments are housed within Grupo Carso, a holding company whose title is a portmanteau of the first letters of his own name and that of his late wife, Soumaya Domit, with whom he had six children. Slim cuts a divisive figure in Mexico, according to his biographer, Diego Enrique Osorno, author of Slim: A Political Biography of the Richest Mexican in the World. “There are Mexicans who look at Slim with pride and see him as an aspirational figure … and there are those who consider him to be the symbol of our inequality,” said Osorno. Slim is known for taking a simple but effective approach to investing, swooping on undervalued assets in times of economic turmoil and picking up bargains amid market panic. Amid the global financial crisis that began in 2008 he snapped up a $150m stake in the Wall Street bank Citigroup and loaned $250m to the New York Times – saving it from bankruptcy, by some accounts. He is said to have picked up his shrewdness for a deal from his father, Julián Slim Haddad, who arrived in Mexico in 1902 in order to avoid conscription into the Ottoman army. The Lebanese immigrant is said to have given his children ledgers to help them understand how to interpret financial transactions. The young Slim, who was a keen baseball player in Mexico City’s middle class Polanco suburb, would trade baseball cards in the playground, keeping a weather eye on his accounts. By 11 he had already bought his first government savings bonds. By 15 he had invested in Banco Nacional de México. Upon leaving university, he became part of a clique known as “los Casabolseros” – a group of slick young stock market players. According to Osorno and the political commentator Denise Dresser, the mathematical nous Slim gleaned during his childhood, together with his vision for a deal, have played a part in his success, but so too has an instinct to stay on the right side of political elites at opportune moments. Many of his business interests were picked up at rock-bottom prices during privatisations by a cash-strapped state. “Slim emerged as a Mexican prototype of the Russian oligarchs, as someone who multiplied their fortunes under the shadow of power,” said Dresser. Unlike some Russian oligarchs, though, Slim developed a reputation for maintaining a low profile, eschewing flamboyance or showy megamansions, with the possible exception of the Duke Semans mansion, an eight-storey home on New York’s Fifth Avenue which he bought for $44m in 2010. Slim does spend some of his vast fortune on art, though; his home has sculptures by Rodin, and paintings by Renoir and Van Gogh. In 1999, his wife died. Slim built an art museum and named it in her honour.",

        "title": "Will I need to spend a lot insulating my home to get a heat pump?",
        "content": "Heat pumps could be the single largest step a household can take to reduce their carbon emissions while saving money on their bills. But many in Britain fear that, even though millions of homes across Europe have benefited from the shift away from gas or oil boilers, the UK’s draughty old homes could prove too great a challenge for the technology. The concern is unsurprising given that the UK has some of the least energy efficient homes in Europe. A study by the smart home company tado° monitored 80,000 users across Europe to find how quickly properties lose heat when outdoor temperatures fall to zero. It found that UK homes lost on average 3C after five hours without heating, compared with just 1C in Germany and 0.9C in Norway. The previous article in the series concluded that while in the vast majority of cases properties of any age can successfully make the switch from a gas boiler, improving insulation helps. So is it necessary to spend a lot on insulation and other mitigating measures to make a heat pump work? The claim Heat pump sceptics argue that while they might work in the well-insulated homes of Norway, Finland and Sweden, the UK’s relatively mild climate and historically high gas reserves have allowed energy efficiency standards to lag, meaning they will not be as effective in UK homes. The devices rely on a constant flow of gentle warmth to build up to the desired temperature, which the unconvinced argue is harder to achieve in a draughty home. Mike Foster, the chief executive of the Energy Utilities Alliance, a trade body that represents gas boiler manufacturers, told the Telegraph that the state of Britain’s housing stock meant heat pumps were unsuitable for up to 54% of homes currently using gas boilers without the eye-watering cost of retrofits. He argued that while many neighbouring European countries were “ravaged by war” in the 20th century and needed to be rebuilt, the UK still has “an awful lot of buildings built before 1919”, which mostly have solid walls. These can be particularly disruptive to insulate as doing so involves extensive building work. There can also be large upfront costs of for insulation of up to £12,000 when applied externally or £7,000 when added internally. “When you have external walls like that, they leak heat, and they’re not ideal for heat pumps,” Foster told the paper. While experts point out that leaky homes are not ideal for any kind of heating, will the switch to heat pumps necessitate Britain spending billions on insulation? The science Independent experts argue that households don’t need nearly as much insulation as they might think for a heat pump. A study of almost 750 UK homes previously referenced in this series by the independent research and technology organisation the Energy Systems Catapult (ESC), found that 85% of homes – from south-east Scotland and Newcastle to south-east England – did not require any extra insulation to have a heat pump successfully installed. About 15% of properties required some energy efficiency upgrades – but in the majority of cases this was loft insulation, which costs less than £1,000 and can be done with minimal disruption. Only “a few” properties required cavity wall insulation – which carries a cost of about £2,700 – or the replacing of old doors. This finding is backed up by UK data collected by Heat Geek, a startup that trains specialist heat pump installers and helps to match them with potential customers. From a dataset of more than 100 properties it found that heat pumps were still able to warm uninsulated homes more efficiently than gas boilers. In one example, a mid-century, mid-terrace house with uninsulated cavity walls recorded a heat pump efficiency score of 4.99 (a score of 3 or above means the device is cheaper to run than a gas boiler). Heat Geek found even a detached home built before 1900 with uninsulated solid walls recorded an efficiency of 4.24. Both homes had loft insulation. Andrew Sissons, a deputy director at Nesta, a charity which undertakes research into home heating innovation, said: “Insulation is a good thing to do in its own right – but your home doesn’t need to be insulated to get a heat pump.” A well-insulated home can make heat pumps run more efficiently but it is more important to make sure that the correct size heat pump and radiators are installed, he said. Some of the least disruptive and lower-cost insulation measures, such as draught proofing and loft insulation, can offer significant energy savings, he said. Meanwhile, more disruptive measures, such as solid wall insulation, are expensive and do not always justify their cost in terms of the savings that can be expected – both in terms of cash and carbon emissions. The caveats Home insulation upgrades are unlikely to be as expensive as heat pump sceptics suggest – but that doesn’t mean that the price of relatively low-cost improvements to radiators and a new water tank don’t still add up. For the 750 homes in the ESC study which installed a heat pump, the total cost was about £14,800 – including the pump, any home upgrades and installation costs. The government’s £7,500 grant towards this work helps, but for many households this upfront cost would pose a financial challenge. There are also a number of home improvement costs that may be non-negotiable for a heat pump to work effectively: larger radiators, a hot water tank and updated pipework. Not all homes require a radiator upgrade but in the ESC study, 93% of homes had theirs replaced as part of the heat pump installation. It also found that 81% had a hot water tank fitted. The need to upgrade old pipework is far less likely. A minority of homes built in the late 1980s and early 1990s were fitted with “microbore” pipes with a diameter of under 15mm. These were compatible with gas boilers and cheaper and quicker to install than a full-sized pipe system. If you are unlucky enough to have these in your home they will need replacing, because heat pumps run at a flow temperature of about 40C, compared with a gas system’s 50-60C . Therefore they require larger pipes to allow for greater volumes of water to transmit heat around the home. This is also why larger radiators and underfloor heating – which have a greater surface area – can make an important difference to how well a heat pump system performs. A study by Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, an applied research organisation, revealed that heating systems which included underfloor heating achieved an efficiency rating of between 3 and 5 while households with radiators only fell between 2 and 4. So are there homes which should not install heat pumps until they’re properly insulated? Yes, says Sissons. These are households struggling with fuel poverty. They should first take advantage of the government funding available to low-income and vulnerable households to improve their insulation at no cost. This would bring immediate benefits to the household – in lower bills and a warmer home – and make it easier to design a heat pump system which can deliver the largest possible cost savings over the long-term. The verdict If you currently live in a home where the heating system keeps rooms comfortably warm, it is very likely that you won’t need to undertake any extra insulation before installing a heat pump. A certified installer can give advice on each individual property. However, if you can afford to invest in low-cost measures like draught exclusion, double glazing and loft insulation, you would get this money back in lower bills over the long term. If you live in a poorly insulated home and are on a low income, you should check whether you are eligible for Great British Insulation – the government scheme that could pay for your insulation as well as covering a new heating system from a qualified installer.",

        "title": "US producer prices slide as inflationary pressures ease; UK housing market weakens – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up…. here’s today’s main news stories so far: Stocks are rallying on Wall Street in early trading, as traders hail the easing of inflation pressures. The tech-focused Nasdaq index has hit a new intraday record high; it’s up 112 points, 0.64%, at 17,721 points. But shares are weakening in Europe today; in London, the FTSE 100 share index has now dropped by 52 points, or 0.65%, at 8162 points. The US producer prices report shows “a sustained easing in pricing pressures”, as the tide turns against inflation, says Ken Tjonasam, portfolio strategist at Global X. Tjonasam explains: “The softer PPI figures, coupled with other recent inflation data, start to throw cold water on the Fed’s overtly cautious comments from yesterday’s FOMC meeting. These shifts suggest a more favorable path ahead, potentially accelerating discussions around easing monetary policy. In short, the data is clear: We’re on a more favorable path, with potential rate cuts becoming more likely as inflation continues to cool.” Today’s “soft” PPI report adds to the better inflation news from the US, says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. Ashworth explains: The 0.2% m/m decline in final demand producer prices was principally due to a 7.1% m/m drop back in gasoline prices but, even excluding food and energy, core producer prices were unchanged. The annual rate of producer price inflation moderated to 2.2%, with core producer price inflation down to 2.3%. Just in: US producer prices unexpectedly fell last month, by the most since last October, another sign that inflationary pressures are moderating. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the producer price index for final demand decreased 0.2% in May, compared with April (when they rose by 0.5%). PPI is a guide to what goods and services producers charge for their wares, so is a good guide to inflationary pressures in the US economy. On an annual basis, the PPI index rose by 2.2% compared with May 2023, down from 2.3% in April. The monthly fall in the PPI index was driven by an 0.8% drop in prices charged for goods, thanks to a 7.1% decline in prices for gasoline. Th BLS adds: The indexes for diesel fuel, chicken eggs, electric power, jet fuel, and basic organic chemicals also fell. Conversely, prices for cigarettes rose 3.3 percent. The indexes for hay, hayseeds, and oilseeds and for residual fuels also moved higher. Services producer prices were unchanged in May after increasing 0.6%. Coming on top of yesterday’s fall in consumer price inflation, this is another welcome sign that the price pressures in the US are easing. It’s the sort of evidence the US Federal Reserve will like to see, as it assesses when it can start lowering US interest rates (after keeping them on hold yesterday). Over in the US, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment support has risen. There were 242,000 seasonally adjusted initial claims last week, an increase of 13,000 on the previous week’s figures. That suggests an increase in US companies laying off workers, as initial claims are a proxy for job losses. More people are missing their direct debit payments, a sign that the cost of living squeeze has not relented. Thre was a 2% jump in the Direct Debit failure rate in May compared with April, according to the Office for National Statistics. On an annual basis, it was 12% higher than in May 2023. A cut to UK interest rates might help to revitalise the housing market, but one doesn’t look imminent. The money markets indicate there’s just a 9% chance that the Bank of England cuts interest rates, from 5.25% to 5%, at its next meeting in a week’s time. Currently, a rate cut is only fully ‘priced in’ for the November meeting, but the Bank could start ease policy in August or September instead, if it is confidence that inflation is falling. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: Mortgage misery is set to endure, as the Bank of England sits on its hands. The swaps market has moved recently, because it’s expecting higher rates to endure for longer, so banks are paying more for their fixed rates, and are passing this onto borrowers. We’ve seen fixed rates from the high street giants rise, and Moneyfacts says the average two-year fixed rate is now 5.97% - the highest since the middle of December last year. RICS figures have revealed that this has already hit the property market, with fewer people looking for a new home and fewer sales agreed. With so many new properties still flooding onto the market, it means agreed prices are on their way down too. The good news is that this shouldn’t endure for too much longer. The market isn’t fully pricing in a cut until November, but it may have gone too far. An August cut isn’t out of the question, so if the data starts to point towards an earlier cut, we could see rates pull back in the coming weeks and months. Greg Abbott, Texas governor, has congratulated Elon Musk on (apparently) winning the shareholder vote on his pay deal, and on moving Tesla from Delaware to Texas. Abbott adds: Welcome to a state that has neither a personal nor a corporate income tax. Incidentally, the value of Musk’s pay deal was estimated at up to $56bn in January. At the current share prices, it’s more like $45bn, we reckon. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, predicts the UK housing market will pick up once the general election campaign is over. “Political uncertainty and fading hopes of a summer rate cut mean demand for UK housing has fallen in recent weeks. Supply remains strong in many areas, which means there is downwards pressure on prices. We expect a stronger autumn market once the election is over and a rate cut moves onto the agenda and average UK prices should rise by 3% this year.” Keir Starmer, the front-runner to become prime minister after the election, has pledged today that Labour will “reform the planning rules,” and build the homes and infrastructure that Britain needs. More here. Eurozone manufacturers made a weak start to the second quarter of this year, new data today shows. Eurozone industrial production fell by 0.1% month-on-month in April, and was 3% lower than a year before. Statistics body Eurostat reported that, over the last year, production of heavy-duty capital goods fell by 5.3%, while output of intermediate goods (used in final products) was down 2%. Production of durable consumer goods fell 3.1%, while non-durable goods were up 0.7%, and energy output fell 1.1%. Technology analyst Dan Ives says the ‘overhang’ created by the row over Elon Musk’s pay packet is now lifting (although we don’t have the final shareholder vote details yet!). Shares in Tesla are rallying in pre-market trading, after Elon Musk posted that shareholders are voting in favour of his $56bn pay award. They’re up around 6.6% at $189, which would recover some of their 28% fall so far this year (they began January near $250). AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says the results of today’s AGM (which begins in almost 12 hours time) will have an impact on Tesla’s share price: “A crunch vote on Elon Musk’s pay at Tesla’s AGM later could either provide a further catalyst for the share price to stall or remove an overhang and allow the shares to power up once more. “Musk, no stranger to controversy, has gone on record as saying his blockbuster pay package will pass by a wide margin but there has been considerable disquiet about its size relative to the recent performance of Tesla. He also says the move to incorporate the business in Texas, linked to the renumeration issue, will get through. “The company’s attempt to protect market share and invest in areas like automation and artificial intelligence has diluted margins and the shares have lost nearly 30% of their value since the start of 2024. Defeat could further undermine Musk’s credibility. “Somewhat unusually ordinary investors, which make up around 30% of the shareholder register, will have a major part to play in the destiny of the vote.” The Moscow stock market has dropped to its lowest level since last December, after the US ratched up sanctions on Russia’s “full war economy”. The MOEX index, which tracks the largest companies listed in Moscow, hit a near-six month low this morning, and is currently down 1.5%. The selloff came after the US has broadened its sanctions on Russia, including a fresh crackdown on banks dealing with sanctioned entities. The US Treasury announced: Today’s actions ratchet up the risk of secondary sanctions for foreign financial institutions that deal with Russia’s war economy; restrict the ability of Russian military-industrial base to take advantage of certain U.S. software and information technology (IT) services; and, together with the Department of State, target more than 300 individuals and entities both in Russia and outside its borders — including in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and the Caribbean — whose products and services enable Russia to sustain its war effort and evade sanctions. In response, the Moscow Exchange announced the immediate suspension of trading in dollars and euros. Russia’s central bank added: “Companies and individuals can continue to buy and sell U.S. dollars and euros through Russian banks. All funds in U.S. dollars and euros in the accounts and deposits of citizens and companies remain safe.” The rouble has fallen by 1% against the US dollar this morning, to 88 to the $, on the foreign exchanges. Short-term UK mortgage rates are hovering close to the 6% mark today, having risen earlier in the spring. Financial data provider Moneyfacts reports that: The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.97%. This is unchanged from the previous working day. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.53%. This is unchanged from the previous working day. Two months ago, the average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate was 5.81%, while longer-term five year mortgages averaged 5.38%. UK housebuilder Crest Nicholson has tumbled into the red, highlighting the struggles in the property sector. Crest made a pre-tax loss of £30.9m in the six months to the end of April, down from a £28.4m profit a year earlier. It completed 11.9% fewer homes than a year before, down from 894 to 788, and was also hit by a fall in reservations at the end of last year. It now expect to make an adjusted pre-tax profit of £22m-£29m for the full financial year, below analyst forecasts of almost £39m. CEO Peter Truscott says the housing sector faces “several macro headwinds”, including stretched affordability, volatile mortgage rates, and low consumer confidence. He told shareholders: Over the last six months, the UK economy has experienced a mix of challenges and positive developments. Inflation, while starting to decline, has remained a persistent issue, impacting consumer purchasing power and business costs. The timing of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England has been a subject of speculation, adding to economic uncertainty. Mortgage rates have been volatile, initially decreasing but rising again due to SWAP3 rates increasing, which has impacted the housing market. Shares in Crest have dropped 10% in early trading. There are signs this morning that the UK housing market is losing momentum, as recent increases in mortgage rates dampen demand from home buyers. The latest poll of UK property surveyors has found that a net balance of 8% saw home buyer demand falling rather than rising in May. That’s the weakest reading since November 2023, Buyer demand was weakest in the South East and South West of England, the report said. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) also reported signs of house prices weakening; its net balance of house prices fell to -17 from a downwardly revised -7 in April, the lowest reading since January. Survey participants also reported a fall in the number of sales agreed during May, although this is expected to rise over the next quarter. Rics chief executive Justin Young said: “Despite an improving overall outlook, today’s data reveals that confidence in the housing market is beginning to dip – just as parties launch their manifestos. “Greater attention must be paid to improving conditions for ‘generation rent’, who are faced with rising rents and a lack of suitable options. “This particular demographic – typically made up of people aged between 18 and 40 – has doubled in the last two decades, so politicians need to focus on them, as well as homeowners, as a means of gaining the support of a growing portion of the electorate. “The housing market needs policies that think longer term, not short, and awareness that the different tenures are interlinked, so there is no one solution that will fix the situation. “With the market under strain, the supply and demand gap in both lettings and buy side continues to create issues.” Julian Jessop, economist at the right-wing thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs, says Rics’s data shows the need to cut UK interest rates soon: SpaceX and its chief executive, Elon Musk, were sued on Wednesday by eight engineers who say they were illegally fired for raising concerns about alleged sexual harassment and discrimination against women, their lawyers have said. The lesson of the Tesla pay packet saga, our financial editor Nils Pratley wrote this week, is that being a director of a listed company involves more than being a cheerleader in the Elon Musk fan club. Nils explains: But before this saga slips out of the headlines, there is the small matter of what the Delaware judge, Kathaleen McCormick, actually said in her 200-page judgment in January. Read the whole thing and the board of Tesla in 2018 comes across as a collection of patsies who were so in thrall to the boss that they were incapable of running even a semi-robust process for setting his incentives. Nobody disputes that Tesla’s share price had to perform a minor miracle to deliver Musk’s prize in full: from a valuation of $50bn-ish, the requirement was to get above $650bn by 2028 (which actually happened in just three years). Rather, the problem was the people Tesla put in charge of negotiating with Musk to determine a fair jackpot. As the judge noted, Ira Ehrenpreis, the lead director, had a 15-year business relationship with Musk. Another member of the working group, Antonio Gracias, went on holiday with Musk’s family. A third was Todd Maron, Musk’s former divorce attorney and the company’s general counsel, “whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition”. McCormick concluded that the process behind the award was “deeply flawed” and the terms “not entirely fair” to all shareholders: in essence, Musk said what he wanted and received minimal push-back. Even if Tesla’s shareholders do approve Musk’s mega pay deal, the company also needs to persuade an already skeptical Delaware judge to recognize it. My colleague Nick Robins-Early explains: However, it is unclear if a court that blocked the deal will accept the re-vote, which is not binding, and allow the company to restore the pay package and move its HQ. A Delaware chancery court judge nullified Musk’s pay package in January. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the board’s process of reaching the dollar figure, which she called “unfathomable”, was illegitimate and that Musk’s ties with board members were too extensive for them to be considered independent. Today is a red letter day for Tesla, which is asking its shareholders to approve a massive compensation package for CEO Elon Musk worth at one stage up to $56bn (£44bn). The package is up for approval, again, after being thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year – which has prompted the electric car manufacturer to also seek investor approval to shift its legal base to Texas. Tesla has been urging shareholders to back the package – the largest ever granted to an executive at a US-listed company – with chair Robyn Denholm warning that Musk could step back if it was blocked. Despite that plea, some major shareholders are opposing the package, including Norges Bank Investment Management, and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS). And major proxy firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had urged shareholders to reject the pay package. Musk, though, has declared this morning that shareholders are voting to approve the package, and the move to Texas, by “wide margins”. Rolling out the red heart emoji, he posted: “Thanks for your support!!” The AGM starts at 9.30pm UK time tonight. Reuters points out that shareholders are allowed to change their vote up to the start of the annual meeting…. The pay package was first agreed by Tesla’s board, and backed by shareholders, in 2018. For Musk to qualify for the money, Tesla had to hit various revenue, profit and share price targets, which were met. But back in January, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in favor of a Tesla shareholder who argued that the company’s board inappropriately set the pay package. The judge agreed Musk’s pay package was unnecessary in keeping Musk dedicated to Tesla, an argument that company officers made during the trial. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Financial markets are clinging onto hopes of a soft landing after the world’s most powerful central banker hailed a fall in US inflation. Under a soft landing, central bankers tame inflation and eventually cut interest rates while avoiding a recession. Sticky price pressures in the US have made this scenario seem less likely, as we’ve moved through 2024. But investors are cheered by yesterday’s data showing that US consumer price inflation weakened to 3.3% in May, along with a fall in underlying inflation. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell bolstered that optimism, telling reporters last night that it was “certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.” Powell was speaking after the Fed left US interest rates on hold, at a two-decade high. And its latest dot plots showed that Fed officials now expect just one interest rate cut this year, down from three forecast in March. They also expect inflation to be more stubborn this year than they thought in the spring. But Powell also hinted that the Fed is ready to cut rates if inflation falls quickly, or if the economy weakened, saying: “If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond.” This lifted stocks on Wall Street, where the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at record highs for a third straight session. Traders are encouraged that the Fed doesn’t see a big slowdown on the horizon, and sanguine that this may mean fewer rate cuts than hoped this year. After all, the Fed now sees an extra rate cut in 2025. So while the landing may be delayed, it may not be too bumpy. Analysts at ING say the Fed wants to see three things: More evidence of inflation pressures easing, more evidence of labour market slack, and softening consumer spending. They add: If we get all three of these, we believe the Fed will indeed seek to move monetary policy from “restrictive” to “slightly less restrictive” with 25bp rate cuts at the September, November and December FOMC meetings. Also coming up today Leaders from the G7 are meeting in Borgo Egnazia in the southern region of Puglia, where they’re expected to approve a plan to use the interest from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine The latest index of US producer prices will test the soft landing narrative, with economists predicting a slowdown in price rises in May.

        "title": "Wake up, fund managers: the Royal Mail bid needs more scrutiny | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "There are two reasons to be suspicious of the Daniel Křetínský-led £3.6bn takeover offer for the parent company of Royal Mail. The first is the suitability of the lead bidder and his 44% co-investors, J&amp;T, which could be one for the next government. The other is purely financial: is the Czech billionaire offering a fair price for International Distributions Services (IDS)? Is 370p a share any good? IDS is recommending acceptance, but there is a weirdness here. The directors’ rejection of Křetínský’s opening shot at 320p in April was pitched in such strong terms that one assumed chair Keith Williams, a boardroom heavyweight not scared of a corporate ding-dong, was digging in to resist his 27% shareholder. Instead, May’s 15% improvement in terms – decent, but not otherworldly – prompted an about-turn. The leap from “highly opportunistic” and “significant undervaluation” (320p) to “fair and reasonable” (370p) needs a better explanation than any offered by IDS so far. For all the crises since privatisation at 330p in 2013, its shares have still spent more time above 400p than below. The initial City chatter in April, note, homed in on 400p as the level at which IDS’s board would be obliged to talk. So, well done Columbia Threadneedle Investments, with its 5% stake. It is the sole big shareholder to protest. “The bid at 370p undervalues the business and doesn’t fully reflect its long-term intrinsic value,” it said a fortnight ago. “We believe that the management team has done a good job to turn the company around and additional equity value can be delivered over time for long-term shareholders.” Consider how an imaginary defence document could go. First, IDS could say 214p, the price before the action started, should be ignored as a base valuation because it was depressed by special factors: the sleepy UK stock market; extra illiquidity as a result of Křetínský’s large holding; and uncertainty over the pace of regulatory reform in an election year. Second, it would emphasise the £300m of annual cost savings if regulator Ofcom accepts a proposal for a reduced second-class service. There’s no guarantee Ofcom will agree to anything, of course, and, yes, Royal Mail has just had a strike-afflicted year of operating losses of £348m. But political breezes have definitely shifted on reform, and new working practices, the product of a peace deal with the CWU union, are only now being implemented. It’s not hard to imagine Royal Mail could eventually generate 3% margins again; when annual turnover is almost £8bn, that’s serious money. Third, IDS could hammer home the value in GLS, its very profitable Dutch logistics company. In the past, City analysts have put standalone valuations on it as high as 350p a share. Fourth – and this really deserves more attention – a defending board could expand on its line from April about “the significant underpin of value through the group’s extensive freehold property portfolio [and] the pension scheme in material surplus”. How much property could be turned into cash as Royal Mail sends more volumes through its shiny new mega-hubs? The company has never said. As for pension surplus, “material” is the right description: it was £1.02bn, according to IDS’s last full-year report. Trustees run the scheme, of course, and, in any case, Křetínský’s EP Group would not be able to access a penny for five years under its undertakings. But the rules allow any surplus to be refunded to the company at buyout or wind-up, IDS confirms, and one or the other will happen eventually. Even if a future surplus is unknowable, £1bn is an attractive position today. Where are the other big fund managers in the valuation debate? Schroders manages a 6.8% stake and won’t comment. Redwheel, with 6.3%, was vocally opposed to 320p but hasn’t opined on 370p. Nothing has been heard from top 10 shareholder Jupiter. Given that the bid is structured to require 75% acceptances, even just a handful of objectors could make a difference. The relevant fund managers are all members of the brigade that normally sings the virtues of engaged experts who know companies intimately. They’ve had ages to ponder. They should say what they think.",

        "title": "UK housebuilder Crest Nicholson slides into loss amid property market woes",
        "content": "The UK housebuilder Crest Nicholson has tumbled into the red and slashed its dividend, highlighting the struggles in the UK property sector. Warning for the fourth time in a year that profits would be below expectations, the FTSE 250 company said it continued to be buffeted by volatile mortgage rates and slowing demand in the housing market. Crest reported a pre-tax loss of £30.9m in the six months to the end of April, down from a £28.4m in the same period a year earlier. Its number of home completions fell 12% in six months when compared with a year earlier. It now expects to make an adjusted pre-tax profit of £22m-£29m for the full financial year, below analyst forecasts of almost £39m. Shares fell 8% in early trading on Thursday. The housebuilder said momentum had “softened slightly” since April, reflecting market expectations that interest rate cuts will come much later in the year than previously expected. It said the general election was also “creating some short-term uncertainty”. Crest is taking a one-off charge of £31.4m – almost double its previous estimate of £15m – after completing a review of costs to fix building defects at four of its sites. It cut its interim dividend by more than 80% to 1p. The housebuilder said that the economic uncertainty that followed the mini-budget in September 2022 had continued to affect the housing market. “While mortgage rates have been stable in the period, there has been little impetus for consumers to enter the market, with many consumers waiting for a reduction in rates,” the company said, adding that planning matters also continued to take longer to progress. The housebuilder’s results are the latest indication that confidence in the UK’s housing market is beginning to falter as markets increasingly bet interest rate cuts will come later in the year. City traders expect the Bank of England will hold off reducing the cost of borrowing from 5.25% when policymakers meet next week. Earlier this year, financial markets expected four quarter-point rate cuts but now expect two at the most, with the first not until late summer or early autumn. A study from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) published on Thursday found that a net balance of 8% of property professionals said homebuyer demand fell rather than rose in May, marking the weakest reading since November 2023. Buyer demand was weakest in the south-east and south-west of England, the report said. However demand continues to outstrip supply in the private rented sector, leaving tenants facing rises in the cost of living and falling affordability levels, Rics said. A net balance of 35% of professionals said tenant demand rose rather than fell. On Thursday, Virgin Money reported strong profit growth bolstered by the effect of higher interest rates. The lender, which is the subject of a proposed £2.9bn takeover by the building society Nationwide, reported a rise in pre-tax profit to £279m in the six months to the end of March, up from £236ma year earlier. However, it said that in its mortgages division, balances reduced by 2% in the first half to £56.6bn, reflecting a subdued market for completions.",

        "title": "‘Perilous for democracy, good for profits’: is big business ready to love Trump again?",
        "content": "Chief executives of some of America’s largest companies will meet privately with Donald Trump later on Thursday, and many CEOs who were once critical of his unprecedented conduct appear increasingly open to the former president’s return to office, a Guardian analysis has found. The private audience with the former president will take place at the quarterly gathering of the Business Roundtable, a powerful Washington lobbying group that advocates for the interests of chief executives of big US firms. Joe Biden was also invited; his chief of staff will attend while the US president is abroad, a Business Roundtable spokesperson said. The meeting comes less than five months before the election and less than four years after CEOs raised the alarm about political polarization and threats to democracy when Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election and incited an insurrection at the US Capitol. Back then, the Business Roundtable – whose members include Apple’s Tim Cook, General Motors’ Mary Barra and JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon – led a chorus of condemnation from corporate America. “The country deserves better,” the Business Roundtable said in a statement on 6 January 2021, calling on Trump and his administration “to put an end to the chaos and to facilitate the peaceful transition of power”. Today, with Biden and Trump tied in the polls, Trump can expect a far warmer reception from corporate bosses. “The reality is … we as CEOs and we as a Business Roundtable, we’re going to work with whoever is in the White House,” Chuck Robbins, the lobby group’s chair and the CEO of Cisco Systems, told Fortune in March. “The way we think about it is, if we have a Trump administration or if we have a Biden administration, regardless, there are going to be things we can align on in both,” Robbins said. While corporate America’s views appear to have changed, Trump’s have not. The former president still has not accepted the results of the 2020 election, nor has he committed to accepting the 2024 outcome. He maintains that the supporters who he urged to storm the Capitol “were there with love in their heart”. And Trump and his campaign have promised a range of divisive and anti-democratic initiatives if he is re-elected, from mass firings of non-partisan government officials to the weaponization of the US Department of Justice against his perceived enemies. Yet a second Trump term promises benefits for CEOs and their companies in a variety of policy areas, from lucrative tax breaks – Trump’s recent pledges include a “business class big tax cut” – to sweeping rollbacks of Biden-era efforts to promote market competition and strengthen worker power. “It has always been clear that the CEOs of the Fortune 500 are not what is going to preserve democracy, and that the CEOs of the Fortune 500 work for their investors who demand insatiable amounts of profit,” said Lindsay Owens of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group. “If they think that President Trump is perilous for democracy but good for profits, I think it has always been clear where they are going to land on this question.” ‘A sad time for our country’ A few days after the 2020 election, dozens of CEOs gathered on a hastily organized 7am Zoom call to discuss Trump’s refusal to accept that he had lost. The executives met “to share observations and talk about what possible roles they might play in encouraging a smooth transfer of power”, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor who has spent decades counseling chief executives, and who convened the post-election Zoom, later wrote. Attending the call were the heads of some of America’s largest corporations, including Walmart, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Blackstone, Comcast and Goldman Sachs. The next day, the Business Roundtable, which counted many of the attending CEOs as members, issued a high-profile statement congratulating Biden and Kamala Harris and urging “elected officials and Americans across the political spectrum to work in good faith to find common ground”. A similar pattern played out in the days surrounding the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol: CEOs and their companies quickly distanced themselves from Trump. Many pledged to stop making campaign contributions to Republican politicians who voted against certifying the election results. Executives were portrayed in the media as patriots who put their self-interest aside and their reputations at risk to speak out. “It’s just a sad time for our country,” Robbins, the Cisco boss, told the New York Times. “At a time where we have so many challenges, the partisanship is astounding.” “Our leaders must call for peace and unity now,” tweeted Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, on 6 January. “There is no room for violence in our democracy. May the one who brings peace bring peace to our country.” While the full list of attendees of the 2020 Zoom call has not been published, the Guardian contacted a dozen companies and trade groups whose current or previous CEOs or members were reported to have joined the call or expressed concerns about Trump’s commitment to the democratic process, such as Cisco and Salesforce. The Guardian sought comment from the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers, another corporate lobbying group, which on January 6 called for Trump’s cabinet to consider removing him from office using the 25th amendment. One company declined to comment. Of the other firms and trade groups, none responded to inquiries about whether they remained concerned about Trump’s commitment to democracy, or whether they would speak out if Trump were to express an unwillingness to accept the results of the 2024 election if he loses. ‘They’ve done the math’ Corporate America’s relationship to Trump is complicated. “The narrative that the business community is hedging their bets and that CEOs are ‘softening towards Donald Trump’ is escalating and fast becoming a fact-free echo chamber of unsupported pronouncements,” Yale’s Sonnenfeld argued earlier this year. Few chief executives of large US companies are personally donating to Trump’s campaign, Sonnenfeld noted. “The money trail, or lack thereof, speaks to the frayed ties between Trump and the business world.” In an interview with the Guardian, Sonnenfeld pointed to a number of policy issues on which CEOs disagreed with the former president. Chief executives “are pro-immigration reform. They are not xenophobes. And … they are not protectionist. They believe in a globalized economy,” Sonnenfeld said. “They also believe in social harmony, either out of personal character, patriotic values or enlightened self-interest. They don’t want furious communities tearing apart the social fabric. They don’t want shareholders screaming at them. They don’t want employees sabotaging each other. They depend on social harmony to navigate their businesses.” “Today, there’s no support of any public CEO for Trump, even though … the polls are far more favorable to him than they were in the earlier two elections,” Sonnenfeld said. But experts and advocates noted that on a range of issues – among them, tax cuts, efforts to undermine collective bargaining and worker power, and regulatory rollbacks, especially environmental protections – CEOs have plenty of reasons to expect that a second Trump term could prove lucrative. “We actually don’t need to overanalyze it,” said Michael Linden, a former Biden administration official who is now a fellow at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “At the end of the day, corporations and CEOs have always liked low taxes. They’ve always liked deregulation. “For all of Donald Trump’s heterodoxy on some issues, [on] those things” – taxes and regulations – “he is standard. He is indistinguishable from Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney or George W Bush or pick your standard Republican.” “I think they’ve done the math,” said Timi Iwayemi of the Revolving Door Project, which tracks corporate political influence. “They can say, ‘We’ve already seen Trump. We had Trump 1.0. Yeah, sure, it was bad, but it wasn’t the end of America. America is still here.’” ‘The stakes are huge, and they are real’ One of Trump’s few legislative achievements as president was a huge tax cut that permanently slashed the corporate tax rate by 40%. A recent report by the non-partisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (Itep) found that the law saved some of America’s biggest and most profitable companies $240bn in taxes between 2018 – the first full year it was in effect – and 2021. Walmart, for instance, paid an average effective tax rate of 31% between 2013 and 2016. After Trump signed his tax cuts into law, the company’s average rate fell to 17%, Itep found. The change saved the consumer goods giant $9bn between 2018 and 2021. Salesforce, meanwhile, paid only $175m in federal taxes over the first five years of the Trump tax cuts, according to previous Itep research. Salesforce brought home about $6bn in profit during the same period. “Obviously, the US government is a large customer of Salesforce, and depending on who’s in office, it creates a whole stir with a different part of our employee base,” Salesforce’s Benioff told Bloomberg in January. “So that’s just a reality. But the reality is that, hey, we are the same company regardless of when that election is going to occur and regardless of who that president will be.” Trump has promised to reduce the corporate tax rate even further if he wins a second term. But corporations are gearing up for an even bigger tax fight next year. Cuts to individual income and estate taxes, as well as business “pass-through” rates – changes that overwhelmingly benefited wealthy and white Americans – are set to expire next December. “Whether they just expire, whether they get replaced by something, whether they get extended, is a massive question, and it will be a question that Congress has to deal with and the president has to deal with one way or the other,” said Equitable Growth’s Linden. “And so the stakes are huge, and they are real.” For corporations, these stakes are even higher following their failure earlier this year to secure passage of a congressional tax deal that would have rolled back some of the taxes meant to pay for Trump’s 2017 tax law. Companies and their trade groups lobbied aggressively for these provisions, which could have saved them hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, the Guardian previously reported. “I think they assume under Trump they will not only get an extension of the status quo, which is very beneficial to them, but they will also have another bite at the apple to get even more than they currently have,” said Owens of the Groundwork Collaborative. ‘A huge turn-off to business leaders’ In other policy areas, a second Trump administration would have more leeway to unilaterally pursue an agenda friendly to big business – and would enter office with a savvier understanding of how to achieve it. “In 2024 Trump will be a much more professional operation,” said the Revolving Door Project’s Iwayemi. “They have a much more clear and deep understanding of the executive branch. And they would have a team that would be fully equipped.” Last year, the rightwing Heritage Foundation published “Project 2025”, a policy-by-policy, agency-by-agency roadmap to “dismantle the administrative state”, as the organization’s president described it. Project 2025 includes a range of policy levers that would roll back efforts to promote economic competition and protect workers. Many of the recommendations align with positions that corporate interests have already taken. For instance, Biden’s Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved new requirements for public companies to disclose some of the risks that climate change presents to their businesses. The final SEC rule was weaker than the agency’s original proposal, and even incorporated recommendations from the Business Roundtable and other trade groups not to require companies to track or report on the climate impacts of their supply chains. Nevertheless, immediately after the rule was finalized, Republican state attorneys general and the US Chamber of Commerce, another corporate lobbying group, sued the agency. “Everybody here [at the Business Roundtable] is committed to climate change, to controlling our carbon footprint,” Robbins told CNBC the day after the SEC finalized the climate disclosure rule. “But some of the requirements – first of all, we’re not sure it’s the SEC’s remit to do that. But secondly … it’s just an incredible amount of work that actually increases costs at a time when we’re talking about inflation …” Project 2025 goes even further, suggesting that Congress prohibit the SEC from requiring these types of disclosures in the first place. It also encourages repeal of other reporting rules that became law after the 2008 financial crisis, such as a requirement that public companies disclose the ratio of CEO compensation to median worker pay. The Business Roundtable spent years opposing federal efforts to require companies to disclose this measure of executive compensation. Another agency that has drawn borderline-obsessive corporate ire is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which under Biden has taken a far more aggressive approach to challenging corporate power than any administration – Republican or Democratic – for decades. Earlier this year the FTC finalized a landmark ban on non-compete clauses. The ban, as the FTC chair, Lina Khan, described it, helps make sure workers “have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business or bring a new idea to market”. “Something that I think Americans have been hungry for, for a long time” is for government “in a muscular way [to] protect them not just as consumers but also as workers and small businesses from serious abuse from big corporations”, said Elizabeth Wilkins, a former White House official who recently stepped down as the FTC’s chief of staff. “This is stuff that people want, but … it’s also stuff that big corporations have been getting away with for a long time,” said Wilkins, now a fellow at the anti-monopoly American Economic Liberties Project. “I am sure that they aren’t happy about it.” The day after the FTC finalized the ban on non-competes, the Business Roundtable filed a lawsuit to stop what it called “this unwarranted regulatory overreach”. “The Federal Trade Commission is a huge turn-off to business leaders,” said Yale’s Sonnenfeld. “Corporations recognize that there’s an alphabet soup of government agencies with the power to properly enforce longstanding laws and, when necessary, crack down [on] corporate exploitation,” said Iwayemi. They “recognize that if you pull any acronym out of the pot – take the SEC or the FTC or whichever – they have the potential to sell out public interest. And that is just much more likely under the Trump administration.” ‘They are not the central heroes of the economic story’ Despite their complaints about the Biden agenda, the fact remains that US corporations have thrived during Biden’s time in office, routinely reporting record profits and awarding sky-high CEO pay. In 2023, the median head of an S&amp;P 500 company took home more than $16m, an increase of nearly 13% from the previous year, according to a recent AP and Equilar analysis. Workers’ wages grew only 4%, the report found. Meanwhile, corporations are salivating over hundreds of billions of dollars in new tax incentives created by Biden-era legislation to tackle climate change and spur domestic investment in infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing. And far from freezing out corporate America – as some progressives had hoped – the Biden White House has aggressively solicited executives’ input. Wilkins described the administration conducting “an enormous amount of outreach to the corporate community”. “They engage, for sure,” Robbins told CNBC in March. “There’s open communication – there always is. So that’s not the issue.” Still, bosses appear increasingly fed up with Biden’s rhetoric. While the Biden administration has “been great for business” and most CEOs are not actively supporting Trump’s re-election bid, that “doesn’t mean that they’re pro-Biden,” Sonnenfeld said. “There are plenty of issues that they have [with Biden] on certain areas. They don’t like being vilified on the tax front, even though maybe some should pay some higher taxes. They smart on setting up a class warfare.” The president “puts workers at the center of the economic universe: unions and labor power and competition and higher taxes on the rich”, said Linden. Corporations “really get offended when people suggest that they are not the central heroes of the economic story. They really don’t like that.” Trump might praise wealthy CEOs, or at least refrain from saying they should pay higher taxes or suffer new consumer protections. Yet one of the former president’s defining characteristics remains his fanatical pursuit of grudges against perceived enemies and those who he believes have slighted him. This track record suggests that CEOs’ silence today – perhaps a result of Trump’s coin-flip odds of ending up back in the White House – may not guarantee their protection from his vindictiveness tomorrow. That, however, is a gamble that many executives appear willing to make. For CEOs: “There may be limited downside to making nice noises about Trump,” suggested Rosanna Weaver, a consultant for the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. “If Trump is elected you have some credit with him. If Biden is elected, he is unlikely to hold the same kind of vindictive grudge that Trump would.”",

        "title": "Australia’s unemployment rate dips to 4% as economy adds 40,000 new jobs",
        "content": "Australia’s unemployment rate eased last month as employers shrugged off rising costs including higher interest bills to keep adding to their workforces. The jobless rate was 4% in May, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. That was in line with economists’ predictions and was a slight drop from April’s 4.1%. The economy added a net 39,700 jobs last month. Economists had predicted the tally of job gains to come in at about 30,000. Full-time roles, which cover 35 hours or more per week, rose by 41,700 in May. Part-time jobs fell by about 2,000, the ABS said. “The latest jobs numbers show our labour market is an important source of strength in difficult times,” the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said. “Despite our economy weakening substantially as a result of higher interest rates, persistent inflation and ongoing global uncertainty, our labour market remains resilient and that’s clear from today’s result.” Chalmers said 880,000 jobs had been added since Labor won office two years ago – the most by any first-term government. Labour market figures are among the most closely watched by the Reserve Bank of Australia as it tries to wring inflation from the economy while maintaining as many extra jobs generated since the Covid disruptions as possible. The RBA and Treasury expect the jobless rate to remain at 4% next month before rising to about 4.3% by June 2025. Signs of unemployment rising too quickly would likely increase the chances of a near-term RBA interest rate cut while excessive jobs growth might prompt another cash rate rise to preclude a revival of inflation. Belinda Allen, a senior economist at the Commonwealth Bank, estimated Australia needed to generate about 40,000 extra jobs a month to keep up with the swelling workforce. Investor reaction to Thursday’s news was modest, with the Australian dollar hovering about the 66.5 US cent mark and stocks holding on to most of the morning’s 0.5% gains. That response indicated investors didn’t think the latest jobs figures would sway the RBA much. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The participation rate remained unchanged at 66.7%. The number of hours worked eased back 9m, or little change in a total of almost 2bn. Bjorn Jarvis, the ABS’s head of labour statistics, said the number of those unemployed fell by 9,000 in May, reversing some of April’s 33,000 increase. “There are now almost 600,000 unemployed people,” Jarvis said. “However, that is still nearly 110,000 fewer people than in March 2020, just before the pandemic.” Across the states, Western Australia’s jobless rate last month was the lowest in the nation at 3.6%, improving from April’s 3.9%, seasonally adjusted. New South Wales also posted a drop to 3.8% from April’s 4%, while Victoria went the other way, rising to 4.4% from 4.2% to be the highest in Australia. Queensland, where state polls loom in October, had an unemployment rate of 4%, compared with 4.1% in April. The ACT was steady at 3.8%, the equal second-lowest in the land. Labour market clearly cooling, economists say Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, said “it’s clear the labour market is cooling”. “In trend terms, unemployment rose to 4% from 3.9% previously,” he said. “Rather than an uptick of layoffs or redundancies, employers are instead tempering their hiring plans and shaving off the hours they offer to their employees. We see the unemployment rate hitting 4.4% by the end of the year and topping out at 4.5% by the middle of 2025.” Krishna Bhimavarapu, an economist at State Street Global Advisor, said the labor market was cooling faster than during previous adjustments. “The annual growth in full-time non-seasonally adjusted employment … is now 85.2% down from its peak in October 2022, greater than the average fall (59.5%) of the nine previous cycles,” Bhimavarapu said. “The RBA will do well to take that into consideration during their policy discussion next week.” The RBA board meets on 17-18 June and is widely expected to leave the cash rate on hold at 4.35% for a fifth meeting in a row.",

        "title": "Federal Reserve holds interest rates at two-decade high as it waits for inflation to cool",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve held interest rates at a two-decade high on Wednesday, as it awaits more signs of inflation cooling. Officials at the US central bank expect to cut rates just once this year, according to projections released on Wednesday after their latest two-day meeting. As recently as March, the last time these projections were released, policymakers expected the Fed to cut rates three times this year. This time around, they opted to keep rates between 5.25% and 5.5%, where they have been for nearly a year. While the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, described price growth as “still too high”, he welcomed official data released on Wednesday which signaled that it had eased. “We want to gain further confidence,” Powell said during a news conference. “Certainly more good inflation readings will help with that.” Inflation cooled slightly in the US last month, according to new consumer price index data that was also released on Wednesday, as consumers’ frustration over high prices continues to loom over November’s presidential election. The consumer price index rose at annual pace of 3.3% in May, slipping back from the previous month’s reading of 3.4%. Price growth has fallen dramatically since surging above 9% two years ago, to its highest level in a generation, during the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. But with many Americans still feeling the pinch, the consumer price index has yet to fall as far as policymakers want. While fuel prices and airline fares fell in May, and grocery price inflation was flat, rising shelter costs, including rent, helped prop up the headline rate of inflation on the year. On a month-to-month basis, however, prices were unchanged overall – bolstering hopes that inflation is heading back towards normal levels. The so-called “core” consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also rose at a weaker-than-expected monthly rate of 0.2%. Still, the slight cooling was not enough for Fed officials on Wednesday, who emphasized that they were waiting for inflation to hit their target of 2%. “The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” the Fed said in a statement on Wednesday. The Fed must balance inflation with the labor market, which can weaken when interest rates are too high. But so far, the labor market has proven strong amid high interest rates. In May, the number of jobs added to the economy surpassed expectations, and unemployment has been under 4% for the last two years – the longest stretch in more than 50 years. Anxiety over the state of the economy continues to linger. Nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month. Unemployment is nearing 50-year lows, and Wall Street has risen sharply since the fall. But as Joe Biden seeks re-election to the White House, surveys indicate he is struggling to reassure voters that the economy has strengthened on his watch. Wall Street opened higher on Wednesday morning as the latest inflation data raised hopes that the Fed could cut rates several times before the end of the year. “We still need several more months of this, but the fundamentals are encouraging,” said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, who suggested a rate cut as soon as September was “still in play”.",

        "title": "How will new EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles work?",
        "content": "The EU has told Beijing that it plans to impose new tariffs on imports of Chinese electric vehicles into the trading bloc, potentially triggering a trade war. So what are the details, how will it affect the industry and will the price of cars on the dealership forecourt be affected? What are the tariffs? The tariffs are aimed at countering the alleged state support handed to China’s car manufacturing industry, which has allowed exported vehicles to be sold at cheaper prices than those of global rivals. It follows a nine-month investigation into alleged unfair state subsidies into Chinese battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and the level of the tariffs differ depending on the brand. The MG owner, SAIC, faces the top tariff. Geely, which owns a stake in Volvo, faces a tariff of 20%. A 17.4% duty will be applied to BYD brands, which include the Dolphin and Seal cars launched in the EU last year. EV manufacturers that cooperated with EU investigators will face a tariff of 21%, while those that did not face the top tier of 38.1%. A 17.1% tariff will push the cost of an entry level €30,000 car up by €5,250. A 38.1% tariff will translate to a €11,450 increase in price. The charges come on top of the existing 10% levy on cars imported into the EU, meaning Chinese-made EVs face total tariffs of up to 48%. When will they kick in? In theory, 4 July. But Chinese companies have until then to provide evidence to challenge the EU’s findings. The rates could then be adjusted. The European Commission has held out the prospect of resolving the dispute through talks before the tariffs provisionally come into force on 4 July. If a consumer ordered a car before this date and the price is already locked in they should avoid the price hikebut they should check their contract. The EU believes that conglomerates like BYD can absorb the level of subsidy and still compete with European rivals by not completely passing tariffs on to the consumer. What is the extent of the Chinese state support the EU alleges? The EU contends that every stage of the EV manufacturing process, from the mine that produces lithium used in batteries to the shipping of cars to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge are subsidised in China by the state at national, regional and local level. Its investigation also found cheap or free land given over to car factories. It found there were case-specific subsidies with alleged provision of lithium and batteries below market price, with battery suppliers acting as public bodies implementing national industrial policy. It also found there were tax exemptions for the battery sector. The investigation discovered a suite of financing advantages including green bonds issued at a lower rate than available in international markets and preferential refinancing rates for funds dispersed in support of the sector. Xi Jinping hopes to achieve global domination in the green tech sector, which also includes solar panels, heat pumps and wind turbines. What is the impact on the European industry? The EU claims that the state support not only enables Chinese car suppliers to directly undercut European rivals, but is causing the slowdown of the EU’s transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to BEVs. The EU plans to end the sale of new ICE cars by 2035. According to the EU, China-made cars accounted for 25% of the EU market in 2023, up from 3.9%. The EU argues that the brutal trade wars in China that have forced prices down at home are now being played out in Europe, with China effectively forcing EU manufacturers to suppress their own prices and in turn hurting their profits and future potential investment. What have the Chinese said? A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, Lin Jian, said the EU’s investigation was a “typical case of protectionism” and tariffs would damage China-EU economic cooperation and the stability of production and supply chains of vehicles globally. He said Beijing would take all necessary measures to “firmly safeguard” its rights and interests. What has the German government said? It is not happy. Not only are its carmakers facing competition at home but an impending trade war will be a blow to its exports to China. “The European Commission’s punitive tariffs hit German companies and their top products,” said the German transport minister, Volker Wissing. China is an important market for Germany’s carmakers – in particular Volkswagen, Europe’s largest auto manufacturer, which has a joint venture with SAIC. Olaf Scholz, the chancellor, has noted that half of EVs imported from China were produced by western manufacturers. What have German car makers said? After the EU announcement, Volkswagen said it rejected the imposition of the duties. “The negative effects of this decision outweigh any potential benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry,” a Volkswagen spokesperson said. Germany’s VDA auto industry association said it was in favour of “free and fair trade”. The Mercedes-Benz chief executive, Ola Källenius, added his voice to the concerns, saying that “what we do not need, as an exporting nation, is rising trade barriers”. And what about other manufacturers? Sweden’s Volvo has said it is “analysing” developments in the investigation, Vauxhall owner Stellantis said it “does not support measures that contribute to the world fragmentation” and Chinese EV maker Nio said that “this approach hinders rather than promotes global environmental protection, emission reduction, and sustainable development”.",

        "title": "Obsessing over the inflation rate misses one key point: the economy is more than just how fast prices are rising | Greg Jericho",
        "content": "Over the past few weeks some economists and commentators have become rather obsessed and unhinged about Australia’s inflation rate. You can, I guess, understand people focusing on inflation, but that should not mean forgetting that an economy is a bit more than how fast prices are rising. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, displayed his inflation myopia when he recently retweeted a chart showing that among “peer” countries of the US, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the eurozone, Australia has had inflation accelerate since December last year. Such political lines are understandable, but less clear is why commentators and economists would parrot them. Last week came the news that Canada’s central bank and the European Central Bank (ECB) had cut their interest rates by 25 basis – this, commentators were quick to argue, proved we need higher rates to get inflation below 3%. For example, the Australian Financial Review’s economics editor, John Kehoe, tweeted in excitement: “Canada becomes first major economy to cut rates, lifting market mood. This is what happens when you get inflation down to 2.7% and lift the cash rate to 5%. You can cut interest rates! Australia inflation is 3.6% and cash rate 4.35%.” Yeah. Woohoo. Alas, we need to add a bit of context. Firstly, Canada’s cash rate has now been lowered to 4.75%, which is still higher than Australia’s current cash rate. I’m not sure that cutting interest rates to a level still higher than Australia’s counts as a win. Also, it is worth remembering Australia’s inflation began to consistently rise above 3% later than other nations such as the US, UK and Canada. It peaked later as well, and other than the December 2022 jump due to one-off travel prices, our inflation peaked lower: If the graph does not display click here So it’s not surprising that Canada’s inflation might have come down earlier. Also given Canada’s inflation rose sooner than ours, its central bank (and others) began raising rates sooner than the Reserve Bank of Australia. The ECB raised rates to 4.5% – marginally above Australia’s current cash rate of 4.35%. Is anyone really arguing that 15 basis points is the difference between getting inflation below 3%? If the graph does not display click here And as for the RBA not being tough enough, in the first six months after raising rates, Australia went harder than the US, UK or Canada: If the graph does not display click here Sure, the RBA (thankfully) did not increase rates by as much as they did in the US or Canada or the UK, but this is not surprising because our economy is rather different. Remember that only two months ago the International Monetary Fund released a report that looked at the impact of interest rate rises in 25 major economies. Australia was rated as the economy in which monetary policy had the strongest power. The US came in 10th, the UK 17th and Canada 18th. The main reason is that a lot more people have fixed rate mortgages in those countries: If the graph does not display click here Arguing Australia’s interest rates should have gone up as fast and as high as they did in Canada is to argue that Australians should have been hurt more than those in Canada for no reason other than to be able to walk around talking about how tough our central bank is. But here’s the real context. Canada’s unemployment rate is 6.2%; Australia’s is 4.1%. Even worse, since March 2022, when inflation began to rise around the world and central banks began raising rates, Canada’s unemployment rate rose 0.7 percentage points from 5.4% while Australia’s has thus far risen just 0.1 percentage point. Is this a situation Angus Taylor would like to see occur here, given he seems to envy other “peer” economies? If the graph does not display click here While Italy’s unemployment rate has dropped considerably, it also has the highest rate across all G7 nations. And yes, the ECB cut rates, but the unemployment rate in the eurozone is 6.4%. Does anyone want to change places? Angus? Similarly, the percentage of people aged 15-64 with a job in Australia has risen from 76.4% in the March quarter of 2022 to 76.9%, while in Canada it has fallen from 75.2% to 75%: If the graph does not display click here One very salient point though regarding Canada is that in the past year its wages have risen 5.2% while here they grew 4.1%. That Canada can have stronger wage growth while also having lower inflation than Australia rather dents the argument that wages are the main driver of inflation. Still, if conservative commentators and politicians here want to call for Australians to get wage rises above 5%, I am all for it! None of this is to say Canada’s economy is in dire shape, or that the RBA have been geniuses or Australians are doing better than anyone else. But this is what a soft landing mostly looks like – inflation coming down slowly while unemployment does not rise too significantly. Those who salivate over other nations’ inflation and interest rates with barely any care for people losing their jobs really need to think about their priorities.

        "title": "UK GDP stagnated in wet April; Wall Street hits record high as US inflation falls – as it happened",
        "content": "Time for a recap… The UK economy flatlined in April, held back by wet weather, as the signs of a recovery from last year’s recession began to fade. In a blow to Rishi Sunak’s hopes of signalling a strong bounceback before the general election on 4 July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said monthly growth slowed after a 0.4% increase in March. The economy was unable to maintain its momentum after being weighed down by the struggling retail sector, a downturn in manufacturing and a drop in construction output. The 0.0% growth figure matched the forecast by City economists, who blamed the month’s heavy rains for difficulties faced by workers on building sites and the lack of shoppers on the high street. Sunak really can’t catch a break, says our economics editor Larry Elliott: The latest growth figures are not strong enough for him to boast about on the campaign trail but not weak enough to persuade the Bank of England to cut interest rates next week. City economists pointed out that the economy did grow over the last three months, by 0.7%, suggesting the recovery was holding up. But unions blamed the government for the UK’s weak economic performance over several years. Meanwhile in America, inflation has cooled slightly – triggering a rally in stocks and bonds, and a weakening of the US dollar. The consumer price index rose at annual pace of 3.3% in May, slipping back from the previous month’s reading of 3.4%. In other news… The world is on track for a major oil surplus by the end of the decade, according to the International Energy Agency. The EU has notified Beijing that it intends to impose tariffs of up to 38% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles. Rishi Sunak must be cursing the British weather, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott: He got soaked to the skin when announcing the general election outside 10 Downing Street last month. Now it appears wet weather has brought a halt to the UK’s economic recovery. Statisticians always caution against reading too much into a single month’s figures and on a quarterly basis things don’t look too bad for the prime minister. Indeed, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to April, compared with 0.6% in the quarter ending in March. But during an election campaign each piece of economic data takes on heightened importance and Labour was quick to exploit the fact that there was zero growth in April. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said it exposed the damage caused by 14 years of “Conservative chaos”. Today’s US inflation report increases the odds of a September rate cut. That’s the verdict of analysts at ABN Amro, who explain: US monthly core inflation rose by 0.2% m/m in May, below consensus expectations of 0.3%. It marks the first sub-2.0% annualized figure since March 2021. Annual core inflation decreased to 3.4% y/y. The downward surprise in core inflation was predominantly driven by a negative contribution from transportation services, which had been running hot over the past year, mostly on the back of large rises in car insurance premiums. In May, car insurance premia decreased by 0.1%, but the largest driver was a 3.6% m/m decrease in airfares. Shelter inflation again put upwards pressure on inflation, rising by 0.4% m/m. Supercore inflation, which excludes shelter, actually fell by 0.04%, the first negative reading since September 2021. Headline inflation came in lower at 0.0% m/m, a mere 0.1% annualized, largely due to falling gasoline prices (-3.6% m/m). The surprise in CPI inflation bodes well for PCE core inflation - the Fed’s primary target - which usually comes in lower, and will be released later this month. The release is good news for the FOMC meeting taking place later today. The surprisingly benign reading shows that the Fed is still making progress on inflation, relieving some of the worries of the first quarter of this year. These inflation figures are a step in the right direction, but policymakers will want to see a couple more months like this before deciding to make a move. Today’s development therefore supports our view that the Fed will cut rates by 25 bps in the September meeting Software giant Oracle is the top riser on the S&amp;P 500 in early trading. Oracle’s share are up 11% after it announced cloud deals with Google and OpenAI last night, which cheered traders despite fourth-quarter results that missed Wall Street expectations. DIY chain Home Depot are the top riser on the Dow, up 4%, followed by Apple which has jumped 2.5% after announcing new artificial intelligence features earlier this week. Boom! The S&amp;P 500 share index, and the tech-focused Nasdaq index, have both opened at new all-time highs on Wall Street. Investors are clearly excited by the drop in US inflation, both headline and core CPI, last month. But….Charlotte Daughtrey, equity investment specialist at Federated Hermes Limited, sounds a note of caution: “US inflation has proven sticker than anticipated so far in 2024, so today’s print will be welcomed by the market. That said, it may be premature to extrapolate this single data point and we would expect the Fed to continue to exert caution, with the prospect of limited rate cuts over the remainder of this year. Ongoing data will continue to be scrutinised as the underlying economic picture emerges.” While the markets are now excited by falling US inflation in May, experts in Britain are still reacting to the news that the UK economy stagnated in April. Here’s Adrian Wright, Associate Dean and Director of the Institute for Research into Work, Organisations and Employment at the University of Central Lancashire: “The April figures for GDP growth are indicative of the huge challenges that lie ahead for the UK economy. We should be guarded against making concrete predictions based on one month’s data alone, especially off the back of a rise in the first quarter of the year. But these figures do show the volatility in economic conditions. It appears that manufacturing, construction, production, wholesale and retail are declining in the economy, and while the decline in construction and retail can be put down to the weather, the same cannot be said for manufacturing. Looking forward, it is uncertain whether this news will influence a change in intention when it comes to interest rates, but what we do know is that high energy bills, food costs and interest rates feed through to high mortgage rates and, therefore, costs on households.” And Professor Costas Milas, of the management school at the University of Liverpool: Today’s GDP reading is disappointing and brings back into the picture a possible interest rate cut later this month. I am surprised government officials have not (yet) “exploited” today’s disappointing reading to re-iterate their plan of tax cuts (announced only yesterday by Rishi Sunak). Would their tax cuts revive GDP growth? The existing economic literature provides some helpful answer. Cuts in national insurance contributions are expected to boost private consumption (as workers will have more money to spend!) and, consequently, stimulate GDP but only in the very short run (less than a year, that is). Nevertheless, these tax cuts will also put upward pressure on inflation for at least two years and, consequently, force the Bank of England to either delay interest rate cuts (in the best case scenario) or increase interest rates (in the worst case scenario). In other words, Sunak’s tax cuts might do more harm than good... Here’s Daniele Antonucci, chief investment officer at Quintet Private Bank, on today’s fall in US inflation: The latest US inflation figures could give the Fed some respite, but only at the margins. After a string of upside surprises, this time around, headline inflation slowed to 3.3%, against consensus expectations of an unchanged reading from the previous month. Core inflation, which strips out volatile components such as energy and food, decelerated somewhat more than envisaged, too. The main issue, though, is that this progress is unlikely to be enough for the Fed to lower rates later today. What’s more, the new projections are likely to show a maximum of two rate cuts this year, not three as shown in the current ones. Markets too now price in between one or two cuts by year-end. This should be seen in the context of an economy that might well be showing signs of slowing, but not when it comes to the jobs market. US bonds have recovered all their losses from last Friday, when a stronger-than-forecast jobs report spooked investors: Here’s a neat chart showing how the markets reacted to the US inflation report: (bond yields move inversely to prices). The US stock market is set for a positive start too. The S&amp;P 500 index is on track to jump 0.8% according to the futures markets, with the Russell 2000 index of small companies jumping 2.7%. Stocks are rallying harder in London too, with the FTSE 100 share inded now up 79 points or almost 1%. Another important development: The yields (or rate of return) on US government bonds are falling sharply as traders react to the drop in inflation. Sovereign bonds in Europe are also recovering, with the yield on UK two-year gilts falling to the lowest in a month. The US dollar is dropping against other currencies, as May’s inflation report bolsters hopes of interest rates cuts in the months ahead. The Fed is setting rates at 7pm UK time tonight! But we’re not expecting policymakers to ease policy quite that soon. Even so, the dollar’s weakness has pushed up the pound by a cent, to a three-month high of $1.2844. May’s US inflation report should give the US Federal Reserve “some degree of further confidence” that the CPI index is heading back towards its 2% target. Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, explains: “While such data will support the view that April’s cooler price data was not a one-off, it is unlikely, on its own, to provide the FOMC with enough confidence to deliver a rate cut just yet, with the next FOMC decision due later today. Nevertheless, the data does lessen the chances of a hawkish shift in Chair Powell’s rhetoric at the post meeting press conference, even if the dot plot is likely to show a median expectation of 50bp, from 75bp, of cuts this year. Markets, as near as makes no difference, now price 2 cuts as the most likely outcome, in line with our base case expectation, for cuts to begin in September, followed by another such 25bp reduction in December.” The US Bureau of Labor Statistics adds: Indexes which increased in May include shelter, medical care, used cars and trucks, and education. The indexes for airline fares, new vehicles, communication, recreation, and apparel were among those that decreased over the month. Newsflash: Inflation across the United States has slowed, news that will be welcomed at the White House and the US Federal Reserve. Consumer prices were flat, month-on-month, in May, having risen by 0.3% during April. And on an annual basis, US CPI inflation slowed to 3.3%, down from 3.4% in the year to April. Economists had expected inflation to come in at 3.4% again, so this is better than forecast! Cheaper gasoline at the pumps helped to ease the cost of living squeeze, while housing costs continued to rise. Today’s US inflation report says: More than offsetting a decline in gasoline, the index for shelter rose in May, up 0.4 percent for the fourth consecutive month. The index for food increased 0.1 percent in May. The food away from home index rose 0.4 percent over the month, while the food at home index was unchanged. The energy index fell 2.0 percent over the month, led by a 3.6-percent decrease in the gasoline index. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, rose 0.2% in May alone, and was 3.4% over the last year – also lower than in April. Parcel delivery firm Fedex is planning to cut between 1,700 and 2,000 back-office jobs in Europe. The cuts, revelaed in a filing on Wednesday, come as Fedex struggles with weak freight demand. Reuters has more details: The cuts will be carried over an 18-month period, the company said, adding that it was expecting a pre-tax cost of $250 million to $375 million related to legal fees and severance benefits. FedEx expects the job cuts to help save between $125 million and $175 million on an annualized basis beginning in fiscal 2027. Ian Plummer, commercial director of Auto Trader, hopes the UK won’t follow the EU’s lead and impose tariffs on Chinese EVs. Plummer explains: “The European Union’s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles is disappointing, and we hope the UK isn’t tempted to take similar action. UK drivers already face a lack of affordable choices when it comes to electric cars, so it doesn’t make sense for us to limit those options even further for consumers. We need to bring more buyers into the market by cutting down the “green premium” which means EVs are usually 35% more expensive than diesel or petrol cars. We’ll only do that with open competition to foster innovation, not by reducing choice for consumers. Chinese entrants are already partnering with UK retailers to deliver a quality, affordable product and they will have an important role to play in the UK’s ongoing transition to electric vehicles.” The oil price has gained around 1% today, showing it wasn’t dragged down by the UK’s economic stagnation or the prospect of a glut by the end of the decade. City economists widely expect the Bank of England to cut UK interest rates in August, a new poll has found. Reuters asked 65 economists for their expectations and all but two predicted the BoE will start cutting interest rates in August. Most of them expect at least one more reduction this year. But, disappointingly for Rishi Sunak, they all expect the Bank to leave interest rates on hold at its June meeting, next Thursday. Fatih Birol, the head of the IEA, has suggests that the surplus in supply over the next decade should prompt oil companies to reassess their strategies: Over in Europe, a trade war could be brewing after the EU has notified Beijing that it intends to impose tariffs of up to 38% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles. The move will trigger duties of more than €2bn (£1.7bn) a year, and will be applied provisionally from next month in line with World Trade Organization rules, which give China four weeks to challenge any evidence the EU provides to justify the levies on imported EVs. The move follows a nine-month investigation into alleged unfair state subsidies into Chinese battery electric vehicles (BEVs) including top brands such as BYD and Geely, which part owns the Swedish brand Polestar, and Shanghai’s SAIC, which owns the British brand MG. The EU said in a statement today: “The provisional findings of the EU anti-subsidy investigation indicate that the entire BEV value chain benefits heavily from unfair subsidies in China, and that the influx of subsidised Chinese imports at artificially low prices therefore presents a threat of clearly foreseeable and imminent injury to EU industry.” In the energy sector, the world is on track for a major oil surplus later this decade, according to the International Energy Agency. In its latest monthly report, the IEA – the energy watchdog – predicts that growth in global oil demand will slow in the coming years as “energy transitions advance”. At the same time, global oil production is set to ramp up, easing market strains and pushing spare capacity towards levels unseen outside of the Covid crisis, it estimates. The global economy consumed around 102 million barrels of oil per day last year. The IEA predicts this global demand will “level off” near 106 million barrels per day towards the end of this decade. It says: Based on today’s policies and market trends, strong demand from fast-growing economies in Asia, as well as from the aviation and petrochemicals sectors, is set to drive oil use higher in the coming years, the report finds. But those gains will increasingly be offset by factors such as rising electric car sales, fuel efficiency improvements in conventional vehicles, declining use of oil for electricity generation in the Middle East, and structural economic shifts. At the same time, the IEA adds, there will be “a surge in global oil production capacity” led by the US and other producers in the Americas such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada and Guyana. The IEA predicts total supply capacity will hit 114 million bpd by 2030, which it calls “a staggering 8 million barrels per day above projected global demand”. This, the IEA adds, could have significant consequences for oil markets – including for producer economies in Opec, as well as for the US shale industry. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, reckons the odds of an August interest rate cut have dipped following today’s growth report: “These growth data further complicate the MPC’s upcoming interest rate decisions. Rate-setters will keep rates on hold in June, but now a cut in August looks a little less likely.” Dutch bank ING are optimistic the UK economy will grow in the current quarter, although not quite as quickly as in Q1 (when it expanded by 0.6%). ING’s developed markets economist, James Smith, says: It may be hard to pick out much in the way of a trend from the UK GDP figures right now at an industry level, but the economy does seem to have built up steam so far this year. We expect 0.4-0.5% GDP growth in the second quarter The UK growth slowdown in April hasn’t dented the mood in the stock market this morning. The FTSE 100 share index has jumped by 0.8%, or 63 points, to 8210, recovering most of its losses yesterday after Wall Street hit record highs last night. Pest control firm Rentokil are the top riser, up 12%, following reports that activist investor Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners have taken a stake in the business. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould points out that Peltz (Brooklyn Beckham’s father-in-law) has turned his attention to Rentokil after losing a battle with Disney: Mould says: Having failed to catch a mouse at Disney, Nelson Peltz is now chasing rats at Rentokil. Shares in pest control specialist Rentokil surged as it emerged activist investor Nelson Peltz’s Trian vehicle had acquired a stake in the business. “Now a top 10 shareholder in the firm, Peltz is likely to pursue a big shake-up of a company which has struggled in comparison with its US peer Rollins, both in share price terms and financial performance. “Given Rentokil does a large chunk of its business across the Atlantic this could include a push to shift its primary listing to the US, which would be another blow to the prestige of London as a listing venue. Trian pursued a similar approach with Ferguson which made the move in 2022.” UK banks are also rising, with Lloyds up 1.9%, while retailer Marks &amp; Spencer are up 2% Here’s a neat thread of the key points from today’s UK GDP report, from James Smith of Resolution Foundation: The big picture, Smith adds, is the UK’s weak productivity over the last 14 years: When the UK growth report was released at 7am, we flagged that production output fell in April, by 0.9%. This fall was driven by a 1.4% drop in manufacturing output – and that was principally due to a 6.1% fall in production of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations. Pharmaceuticals had grown 7.6% in March, so clearly it’s a volatile part of the economy. April’s stagnation is, hopefully, a blip in the UK’s economic recovery from last year’s short, shallow recession, City economists say. Philip Shaw of Investec says that poor weather was “at least partly” the cause of the economy stalling in April, adding: This follows a run of firmer outturns over Q1 this year (Jan +0.3% m/m, Feb +0.2%, Mar +0.4%), resulting in growth over the quarter of 0.6% as the economy escaped a very mild recession over H2 last year. We consider though that April’s numbers represent a blip in the recovery story rather than the start of a new downturn and that activity will crank up a gear or two over the coming months as the special negative factors disappear. Tom Pugh, the chief economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, suggests the drop in growth in April is “a bump on the upward path”, rather than a return to stagnation. Pugh explains: Overall, today’s data reinforces our view that Q4 last year will represent the nadir of a particularly painful period of stagnation for the UK economy. But Q1 represented a turning point. The weakness in April is just a small bump in the road. Interest rate cuts are likely to come in the summer, growth should continue in the first half of this year, and pick up further after the summer and into 2025. Indeed, we’re expecting growth to average 0.3% q/q over the next year, a much stronger performance than the last five. The Conservative Party point out that the economy did grow in the February-April quarter (as flagged earlier). They’re also sticking to the PM’s claim the economy is turning a corner (despite April’s stagnation resembling a cul-de-sac rather than a motorway). A Conservative Party spokesman says: “Today’s figures show our economy grew by 0.7% in the three months to April. There is more to do, but the economy is turning a corner and inflation is back down to normal. This election is choice. Under the Conservatives, we can keep the economy growing with our clear plan to cut taxes on work, homes and pensions, or we can risk all that progress with Labour’s £2,094 of tax rises on every working family.” Reminder: Sir Keir Starmer has rejected that tax rise claim as “absolute garbage”: In another sign of economic weakness, furniture retailer DFS has issued its second profit warning of the year this morning. DFS blamed much of the drop on delays to deliveries and higher shipping costs caused by the Red Sea crisis. It told shareholders that the upholstery market is “very weak” and that since its last financial results in March: …consumer demand in the upholstery sector has remained challenging and Red Sea routing issues have persisted resulting in delays to customer deliveries and higher freight costs. DFS, which owns 118 shops across the UK, said it expected pre-tax profits of £10m-£12m for the year ending 30 June 2024, well down on the £20m-£25m predicted in March. The lack of growth in April will make it hard for Rishi Sunak to repeat his controversial claim that the UK economy is going ‘gangbusters’. As the Financial Times puts it this morning: In his campaign appearances ahead of the snap July 4 election, Sunak has frequently cited Britain’s first-quarter growth of 0.6%, which ended a brief technical recession, as a sign of the country’s economic strength. The prime minister has sought to persuade voters that the UK is enjoying “gangbusters” growth — a word he ascribed to the ONS, but which the statistics agency said was not intended as a comment about the overall state of the economy. The “gangbusters” line was used by the ONS’s chief economist in a briefing with journalists in May, when the UK officially exited recession, and led to an investigation: Here’s more from shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves (who we heard from earlier) on the news that the economy flatlined in April: Reeves says: “Rishi Sunak claims we have turned a corner, but the economy has stalled and there is no growth. “These figures expose the damage done after 14 years of Conservative chaos. “We are now in the third week of this General Election campaign and in that time the Labour Party has set out its plan to grow the economy by bringing back stability, unlocking private sector investment and reforming our planning system. “All the Conservatives are offering is more of the same, with a desperate wish list of unfunded spending promises that will mean £4,800 more on people’s mortgages. Rishi Sunak’s plan is a recipe for five more years of Tory chaos. “It’s time for change. The election on July 4 is a chance to vote Labour so we can end the chaos, turn the page and rebuild our economy.” We really mustn’t forget that monthly GDP data can be very volatile. Quarterly growth figures give a better picture; on that basis, the economy grew by 0.7% in the three months to April compared with the three months to January. Simon French, economist at investment bank Panmure Gordon, has posted a chart showing monthly GDP fluctuates, partly due to ‘events’ such as bank holidays, funerals, and the weather: The Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates at its next meeting, on 20 June, despite the economy flatlining in April, predicts Suren Thiru, ICAEW economics director: “These figures suggest that the UK economy stumbled noticeably in April as poor weather and the lagged impact of previous interest rate rises weakened key drivers of GDP, notably manufacturing and construction. “This lacklustre outturn should be the low point, with the uplift to people’s incomes from weaker inflation likely to drive output higher in the coming months, aided by the expected boost to consumer activity from Euro 2024. “The longer-term outlook will be heavily influenced by the extent to which whoever wins the general election is able to tackle the long-standing structural issues holding back our economy, including poor productivity and high economic inactivity. “Despite these disappointing GDP figures, a June interest rate cut looks improbable with the Bank of England likely to be a little wary of shifting policy in the middle of a general election campaign.” The City agrees. This morning, the money markets indicate there’s juat a 9% chance of a rate cut next week. April was another poor month for the UK construction sector, today’s GDP report shows. Monthly construction output is estimated to have decreased by 1.4% in April, its third consecutive monthly fall. New work (eg: building new houses) shrank by 1.9%, while repair and maintenance dropped by 0.8%). Bad weather was clearly a factor, as was the squeeze on the property sector from high interest rates. Clive Docwra, managing director of property and construction consultancy McBains, says today’s digures are “a further blow for the industry”, which remained in recession in Q1 2024. “A close to two percent fall in new work across the board highlights the continuing caution shown by investors being reluctant to commit to new projects while so many economic uncertainties remain. New work in private housing in particular remains in the doldrums, seeing a fall of more than four percent. “Many in the industry are crossing their fingers for a post-election boost, but today’s figures show that whichever party forms the next government has a job on its hands to restore confidence and encourage growth. Emma Fildes, founder of the buying agency Brick Weaver, points out that the main contributor to the monthly decrease in construction activtiy was “private housing new work”: Michael Wynne, director of the sustainable housebuilder Q New Homes, says:: “Construction output is still shrinking, and the industry once again has the unwanted distinction of being the weakest sector in a weak economy. “Today’s data is disappointing on virtually every level. The contraction isn’t just confined to certain subsectors of the construction industry either, with seven out of nine heading in the wrong direction. “And while April’s poor weather – which delayed work on many building sites – might explain the sharp drop in that one month, April was no anomaly. The less volatile quarterly measure of output also shows a 2.2% contraction – the sixth time in a row it has been stuck in reverse. The next government must focus on structural reforms, and ways to boost public and private investment, to get the economy growing faster, says Hailey Low, associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research: Today’s subdued GDP figures signal that the UK remains fragile on its route to a sustained economic recovery. However, the broader perspective remains an economy grappling with stagnation as low productivity and high economic inactivity curtail growth potential. Structural reforms and policies to boost public and private investment should be the focus for the next government, to enter a new era of higher economic growth.” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chancellor, has posted that today’s GDP data dents the prime minister’s claim that the economy has turned a corner: Rishi Sunak claims we have turned a corner, but the economy has stalled and there is no growth. The Conservatives have failed. It’s time for change. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak says: “Our economy is slowing yet again. This has been the worst government for growth in modern times – and working people have paid the price. “Real wages are still worth less than 2008. Unemployment is rising at the fastest rate in the G7. And economic inactivity is at record levels. “The Conservatives can spin all they like. But the last 14 years have been dismal for growth and living standards. “They have turned Britain into a stagnation nation.” The lack of growth in April shows the need to rebalance the UK economy in favourof working people, argues Unite general secretary Sharon Graham: “Once again, the latest GDP figures show how far away we are from the kind of high economic growth that politicians keep promising is over the next hill. The hard truth is there won’t be any return to significant growth unless we get to grips with the UK’s collective bargaining and under-investment crises. “It’s crunch time. If it wants to avoid yet more managed decline the next government will have to make different choices. Simply restoring collective bargaining to 1996 levels would increase GDP by 2.8%.” Digging into today’s GDP report, we can see that the “information and communication” sector was the fastest-growing part of the services economy in April. It grew by 2.3% in April, driven by growth of 3.2% in computer programming, consultancy and related activities, as well as growth of 1.7% in telecommunications and 4.9% in publishing. But at the other end of the scale, output in consumer-facing services fell by 0.7% – driven by a drop in activity in the retail sector (as bad weather kept people away from the high street). Wet weather in April derailed the economy’s growth push, experts are explaining this morning. Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, says: “The great British weather can be thanked for today’s poor GDP figures, as persistent rain has kept consumers from spending and caused economic growth to grind to a halt for the month with no growth registered. With rainfall in April 55% higher than average and the wettest April since 2012, it is perhaps no surprise to see the economy struggle as a result, with sectors such as retail, construction and pubs all severely impacted. “Whilst the weather has thankfully improved of late, likely boosting May’s reading, the second quarter is off to a slow start and has a lot of catching up to do if it is to match the 0.6% growth seen in the first quarter. Ben Jones, lead economist at the CBI, says the cost of living squeeze, as well as the rain which bucketed down in April, also hit growth: “After one of the wettest Aprils since records began it’s no surprise that rain dampened consumer spending, with many households also feeling the pinch from higher prices and bills. “But consumers and firms alike are going to start to feel the benefit of lower inflation, which in turn should boost confidence and support spending as we head into a summer packed with major entertainment and sports events, like the Euros. April’s GDP reading is the worst since last December, when the economy also stagnated, and ends a three-month run of growth: Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, says: The stagnation in GDP in April doesn’t mean the economic recovery has been extinguished, but it’s hardly great news for the Prime Minister three weeks ahead of the election. Happily, Dales doesn’t believe the economy is “on the precipice” of another recession; he points out that other indicators, such as the activity PMIs, suggest the economy is still expanding. Britain’s economy was dragged down by the factory sector, and by the building sector, in April. The ONS says: Services output grew by 0.2% in April 2024, its fourth consecutive monthly growth, and also grew by 0.9% in the three months to April 2024. Production output fell by 0.9% in April 2024 following growth of 0.2% in March 2024, but grew by 0.7% in the three months to April 2024. Construction output fell by 1.4% in April 2024, its third consecutive monthly fall, and fell by 2.2% in the three months to April 2024. Newsflash: the UK economy stagnated in April, a blow to Rishi Sunak’s claim that it has turned a corner. UK GDP was unchanged month-on-month in April, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows, following growth of 0.4% in March. That is in line with City expectations, and shows the economy struggled to maintain momentum in April after leaving recession in the first quarter of 2024. Although the services sector grew, there was a contraction in production (which include manufacturing) and across the construction sector. Today’s GDP report will paint a picture of the UK domestic economy, says Thomas Watts, investment analyst at abrdn Portfolio Solutions, and one which the electorate will pay attention to: GDP is often considered the broadest measurement of the health of an economy, gauging the change in the total value of all goods and services produced by a country. With the UK having just exited a shallow recession with economic growth having re-entered positive territory, many will be hoping that the trend can continue. The data also takes on added significance as it acts as one of the final pieces of big economic data before the upcoming general election and will be sure to influence voter thinking when heading to the polls. The Euro 2024 men’s football tournament could give the UK economy a lift this summer. A survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has found that 6% of shoppers expect to buy a new TV or electronic device to watch the tournament, which begins on Friday, and in which both England and Scotland are playing. Some 13% of people plan to spend more on groceries, beer, wine and spirits and takeaways to enjoy while watching the Euros; retailers could also benefit from merchandise sales. Kris Hamer, director of insight at the BRC, says: After sluggish spring sales, shoppers are expected to kick off their summer spending at the Euros. Here’s hoping England and Scotland can make it all the way to the final.” 🤞🤞 On an annual basis, the UK economy is forecast to have grown by 0.6% in the year to April, down from 0.7% in the year to March. That would be a sluggish performance, reflecting the drop in GDP recorded in the second half of 2023. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Rishi Sunak’s claim that “the economy has turned a corner” is about to be tested. New gross domestic product data, due at 7am, will show how the UK economy fared in April. It’s the last official healthcheck on UK economic growth before the election, a day after we learned that unemployment rose in the February-April quarter. The City, on balance, expect no growth during the month, in which bad weather hit retail sales spending. A Reuters poll of economists found that the consensus forecast is for 0% change in GDP in April. But there’s a range of predictions – from an optimistic +0.2% growth to a gloomy -0.3%. Even the top of those forecasts would be a slowdown compared with March, when the UK grew by 0.4%, helping the economy exit recession. Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, Sanjay Raja, is among those predicting stagnation in April, saying: After a thumping end to Q1-24, we expect the UK economy to start out flat as we enter Q2-24. UK GDP, we think, will likely stall in April, weighed down by falls in both the services and manufacturing sectors. Risks are skewed to a slightly stronger print based on our nowcasts. Jefferies’ economists Modupe Adegbembo and Mohit Kumar expect growth of 0.2% in April, telling clients: Growth momentum remains robust in the UK, but monthly numbers tend to be volatile and impacted by factors such as weather. In April, the UK saw one and a half times more rain than usual which is likely to have dampened activity in construction and services.

        "title": "EU to put tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese electric vehicles as trade war looms",
        "content": "The EU has notified Beijing that it intends to impose tariffs of up to 38% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, triggering duties of more than €2bn (£1.7bn) a year and a likely trade war with China. The tariffs will be applied provisionally from next month in line with World Trade Organization rules, which give China four weeks to challenge any evidence the EU provides to justify the levies on imported EVs. The charges come on top of the existing 10% levy on cars imported into the EU, meaning Chinese-made electric cars face total tariffs of up to 48%. China immediately hit back, promising to “resolutely take all necessary measures to firmly defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies”. The move follows a nine-month investigation into alleged unfair state subsidies into Chinese battery electric vehicles (BEVs), including top brands such as BYD, Geely – part owner of the Swedish brand Polestar – and Shanghai’s SAIC, which owns the British brand MG and has a joint venture with Volkswagen in China. In a statement, the EU said: “The provisional findings of the EU anti-subsidy investigation indicate that the entire BEV value chain benefits heavily from unfair subsidies in China, and that the influx of subsidised Chinese imports at artificially low prices therefore presents a threat of clearly foreseeable and imminent injury to EU industry.” Under the plan, Brussels will apply five levels of tariffs. EV manufacturers that cooperated with EU investigators will face a tariff of 21%, while those who did not will be hit with the top tier of 38.1%. The MG owner, SAIC, faces the top tariff. Geely, which owns a stake in Volvo, faces a tariff of 20%. A 17.4% duty will be applied to BYD brands, which include the Dolphin and Seal cars launched in the EU last year. The tariffs could come in as early as 5 July, adding a potential €5,250 to the cost of a €30,000 entry-level BYD car. In theory it means that a Volkswagen car produced in China but sold in Europe could be more expensive than a BYD brand, but officials said research showed the German manufacturer’s Chinese products were not sold in Europe. Officials said Chinese-owned car plants in the EU, including a planned BYD factory in Hungary, were not included in the scope of this investigation, underlining the EU’s preferred trade strategy of creating jobs in the bloc. It is understood that Tesla cooperated with the EU and may initially face the 21% tariff. The EU indicated this could be revised next month to its own individually calculated duty rate after assessing evidence submitted by the US company. The EU vice-president Margaritis Schinas said the provisional results of the investigation showed the car production in China benefited from “unfair subsidisation, which is causing a threat of economic injury to EU battery electric vehicles producers”. The investigation by the EU presented to China on Wednesday included data showing “injury” and “threat” to the European car sector. It claims the EU’s transition from combustion engines to BEVs has slowed because of the competition from China. If not addressed it would lead to loss of investment and jobs in a sector that employs almost 13 million people in Europe, sources said. Schinas said the EU had “reached out to the Chinese authorities to discuss these findings and possible ways to resolve the issue”. European manufacturers are bracing themselves for retaliatory measures. The value of all EU vehicles exported is valued at close to €200bn in 2023, making China the bloc’s third most important market by share (%) after the US and the UK. The EU fully expects China to impose further counter-duties on exports from other sectors, ranging from French cognac to dairy products. The move heightened tensions in Germany, which wants to protect its exports to the massive China market. “The European Commission’s punitive tariffs hit German companies and their top products,” Berlin’s transport minister, Volker Wissing, posted on X, formerly Twitter. “Cars must become cheaper through more competition, open markets and significantly better business conditions in the EU, not through trade war and market isolation.” However, insiders say China’s overcapacity in car manufacturing is a live global issue that will be raised at the G7 leaders summit in Italy on Thursday. The EU hopes to persuade other leaders that the response to China’s overcapacity in cars, steel and other items including solar panels and electric vehicle batteries needs to be “targeted”, limiting the harm to non-Chinese G7 member states. Sources point to Joe Biden’s recent decision to slap 100% tariffs on Chinese EV imports and Turkey’s recent tariffs of 40%. Those familiar with the subject also say there are worries among G7 members that overcapacity of Chinese production could hit emerging economies such as Brazil, Mexico and India. The EU Chamber of Commerce in China, which represents the interests of European companies in the country, said that any tariffs levied must be “transparent and consistent with WTO rules”. Sigrid de Vries, the director general of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, said: “What the European automotive sector needs above all else to be globally competitive is a robust industrial strategy for electromobility.”",

        "title": "Legal & General to expand pensions and sell housebuilder Cala",
        "content": "The new boss of Legal &amp; General has announced a shake-up of the company, including a sharper focus on its booming pensions arm and putting its housebuilding business up for sale. The insurance and asset management group’s new chief executive, António Simões, a banker who started in January and previously worked for Santander and HSBC, promised a “simpler and better-connected” business, focused on three divisions. In his first big strategy announcement, Simões said the £14bn FTSE 100 company would double down on the rapidly growing market for corporate pension deals, in which companies pay insurers to take on their retirement liabilities. L&amp;G, the UK’s biggest provider of defined contribution pension schemes, is aiming to complete between £50bn and £65bn of deals in the UK by the end of 2028, up from a previous target of £40bn to £50bn. Last year, it agreed £13.7bn globally, including £12bn in the UK. Simões said it represented a significant opportunity, as only 10% of the £6.6tn of defined benefit pension assets in the UK, the US, Canada and the Netherlands have so far transferred to insurers. He said the transfers represented a “store of future profit”. “We need these reliable earnings after that for years to come – we’re talking about decades,” he added. As part of the shake-up, L&amp;G will create one global asset management business, rolling Legal &amp; General Capital, which invests in infrastructure and building projects, into its traditional asset manager, Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), including a new private markets division. Michelle Scrimgeour will step down from her role as chief executive of LGIM. The company is looking globally for a chief executive to lead the new bigger division. The company is aiming to sell “non-strategic” assets, the biggest of which is the housebuilder Cala Homes, along with legacy land and real estate, such as a shopping centre in Bracknell, Berkshire. However, it will continue to invest in affordable homes, which Simões described as a “key strategic business”. Notably, the announcement did not feature the “inclusive capitalism” phrase used frequently by his predecessor, Nigel Wilson, who invested in “socially useful” assets such as science parks, student accommodation and retirement housing. Simões insisted that a “deep sense of purpose” remained central to the strategy. Despite the sweeping changes, which analysts viewed as positive, Simões said there would be no redundancies but that he planned to make “efficiencies” across the business, including using fewer cloud providers. “This is a growth plan, and we’re investing to grow the business, so this is not about redundancies,” he said. The company said the changes were intended to make the business sustainable in the long run, even when the pensions transfers dry up. L&amp;G said it would return more to shareholders in the coming years than planned, with a first share buyback of £200m this year, along with a 5% rise in the dividend. This will be followed by 2% dividend growth a year until 2027 and further share buybacks. The company’s share price fell more than 5% on Wednesday.",

        "content": "Co-operative Bank customers have hit out at the lender after a glitch led to payments being taken twice from some business accounts. Customers said they had been pushed into their overdrafts because of the problem, which has resulted in previous payments, sometimes made several weeks before, being duplicated. One business owner said on social media that they had been left “almost £5,000 down”, while another claimed they had only realised that money had been taken when they could not buy petrol. Others have complained that the incident has meant they have been unable to buy supplies and run their businesses. The bank said: “We are aware there are a small number of SME account holders who have duplicated payments showing in their balances and are in the process of correcting this issue. “We apologise for any inconvenience caused and are supporting customers during this period.” The Guardian understands that if any customers have suffered financial detriment as a result of the problem, the Co-op Bank is looking to remediate accordingly. The Co-op Bank has almost 5 million customers, including 95,000 accounts for small and medium-sized businesses. The Guardian has contacted the Co-op to ask how many customers have been affected. After the incident, other customers complained on social media that they had been stuck on hold on the bank’s support line for long periods. One customer posted on X: “You’ve destroyed my working day due to this, I’ve ended up stranded at a van hire office for two hours, having been stuck on hold on the phone to you for over an hour, with no pick up.” Another business tweeted on Tuesday night: “A full 24 hours in and account still in debit, not a single update, business not able to pay suppliers, I’m using my personal account to get by, this is very poor service indeed.” Despite apologising on its X account, the company’s website did not have any details about the problem. Coventry Building Society said in April it would buy the bank from its hedge fund owners in a deal worth £780m. Coventry said this could result in the Co-op Bank brand disappearing within several years. In March, Co-op announced it would look to cut 400 jobs in a bid to cut costs and restructure the business.",

        "title": "Another washout for Rishi Sunak as rain dampens UK growth",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak must be cursing the British weather. He got soaked to the skin when announcing the general election outside 10 Downing Street last month. Now it appears wet weather has brought a halt to the UK’s economic recovery. Statisticians always caution against reading too much into a single month’s figures and on a quarterly basis things don’t look too bad for the prime minister. Indeed, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to April, compared with 0.6% in the quarter ending in March. But during an election campaign each piece of economic data takes on heightened importance and Labour was quick to exploit the fact that there was zero growth in April. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said it exposed the damage caused by 14 years of “Conservative chaos”. In truth, it looks as if Reeves will inherit an economy in a slightly better state that she might have imagined a few months ago. The economy is out of recession and inflation is expected to be back to the government’s 2% target when the May figures are released next week. What’s more, the economy would have grown in April had it not been for a 1.7% drop in construction output and a 2% fall in retail activity. Both declines were almost certainly weather-related. That’s not to say the economy would have exactly been booming had April not been so cold and wet. Manufacturing output, which is not affected by the weather, fell by 1.7%. Sunak really can’t catch a break. The latest growth figures are not strong enough for him to boast about on the campaign trail but not weak enough to persuade the Bank of England to cut interest rates next week. Threadneedle Street is expecting growth in the second quarter to be just 0.2% but that looks overly pessimistic. It would only take monthly growth of 0.1% in both May and June for the economy to expand by 0.4% in the second quarter. Unless something truly unexpected happens in the next three weeks, Reeves will be installed in the Treasury by the time borrowing costs start to come down.",

        "title": "UK economy flatlines in blow to Rishi Sunak’s hopes of recovery",
        "content": "The UK economy flatlined in April, held back by wet weather, as the signs of a recovery from last year’s recession began to fade. In a blow to Rishi Sunak’s hopes of signalling a strong bounceback before the general election on 4 July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said monthly growth stalled after a 0.4% increase in March. The economy was unable to maintain its momentum after being weighed down by the struggling retail sector, a downturn in manufacturing and a drop in construction output. The 0.0% growth figure matched the forecast by City economists, who blamed the month’s heavy rains for difficulties faced by workers on building sites and the lack of shoppers on the high street. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the underlying weakness of the economy was revealed by figures that showed growth so far in 2024 had only recovered lost ground from the recession last year. “Rishi Sunak claims we have turned a corner, but the economy has stalled and there is no growth,” she said. Sunak said in March that the economy was “bouncing back” from a downturn in 2023. Responding to Wednesday’s figures, a spokesperson for the Conservative party said: “There is more to do, but the economy is turning a corner and inflation is back down to normal.” Manufacturing output fell by 1.4% month on month in April, while construction activity was 1.4% lower and retailers lost 2% of their trade. These declines were balanced out by a 2% rise across the whole services sector, boosted by rises in IT and communication services, professional businesses (1.2%), and arts and entertainment (2.6%). The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, said the economy’s stagnation was causing long-term harm to households’ incomes. “Our economy is slowing yet again,” the TUC leader said. “This has been the worst government for growth in modern times – and working people have paid the price.” He said analysis of official figures showed that annual growth had averaged 1.5% since 2010, the worst performance for a government since the great depression. Wages, after taking inflation into account, were worth less than 2008, Nowak added, and unemployment had risen at the fastest rate in the G7 this year. “The Conservatives can spin all they like. But the last 14 years have been dismal for growth and living standards.” Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the economy could begin to grow again during the summer. “Despite the stalling of the recovery in April, the dual drags on economic growth from higher interest rates and higher inflation will continue to fade throughout the year. That will generate a bit of an economic tailwind for the next government,” he said. Separate surveys of private sector businesses show most areas of the economy have expanded month on month since the beginning of the year. Figures released last month showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to the end of March – the strongest rate of quarterly growth since the end of 2021 – confirming the UK had officially exited recession after the economy contracted in the second half of last year. In the three months to the end of April growth was 0.7%, the same level forecast for the whole year by the International Monetary Fund in its biannual outlook in spring. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently downgraded its prediction for UK growth this year from 0.7% to 0.4%. The Paris-based organisation said longer-term issues faced by the UK, including a major skills shortage, high prices in the shops and elevated interest rates, accounted for the gloomy outlook. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said April’s zero growth rate in national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), was unlikely to encourage the Bank of England to cut interest rates at its meeting later this month. “Despite these disappointing GDP figures, a June interest rate cut looks improbable, with the Bank of England likely to be a little wary of shifting policy in the middle of a general election campaign,” he said.",

        "content": "The furniture retailer DFS has issued its second profit warning of the year, blaming much of the drop on delays to deliveries and higher shipping costs caused by the Red Sea crisis. The retailer, which owns 118 shops across the UK, said it expected pre-tax profits of £10m-£12m for the year ending 30 June 2024, well down on the £20m-£25m predicted in March, amid supply chain disruption and weaker consumer demand. This comes just months after the company revised down its initial profit forecast of £30m-£35m for the year. The company said in an update on Tuesday that the fall in profits was driven in part by Red Sea routing problems caused by the attacks by Houthi militants in Yemen on commercial shipping vessels travelling through the stretch of water. It added that this was leading to higher than expected freight rates for deliveries of goods, which had also affected profits. The attacks, which began in November, have made many of the world’s biggest shipping firms stop taking ships through the Red Sea, instead redirecting them around the tip of South Africa, passing the Cape of Good Hope. This diversion can add 10 days to a journey and increase fuel costs by 40%. The disruption has also sent freight rates rocketing, with the British Chamber of Commerce reporting earlier this year that some of its members had experienced a 300% increase in container hire since the attacks began. DFS said this had resulted in a lower level of customer orders arriving on time, with about £12m-£14m of deliveries being delayed because of the Red Sea disruption. These will now be moved into next year’s results. The company also pointed to slowing consumer demand, as sales in the upholstery sector had dropped by 10% annually, adding that trade began the year at a weak level. DFS said it had been encouraged by an upturn in its fourth quarter, with orders up by 9% compared with the previous year. This was partly driven by successful initiatives such as strengthening the ranging and pricing of its Sofology range and reintroducing a four-year interest-free credit option for buyers. It said: “While the economic outlook remains hard to predict we expect the widely predicted lower inflation and interest rate environment to have a positive impact on upholstery market demand levels with the declines experienced across the last three years starting to reverse and the market slowly recovering in our FY25 period.” DFS shares fell 10% in early trading on Wednesday after the announcement.",

        "title": "Poor investment in UK regional cities curbed economic growth, report finds",
        "content": "A failure to invest in the UK’s main regional cities has held back economic growth and meant standards of living lag behind the US, France and Germany, according to a report before the 50th G7 summit in southern Italy this week. The Centre for Cities thinktank said the major difference between the UK and its main rivals was the low level of productivity in cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Sheffield and Nottingham. It said the higher level of productivity – measured by the output of each worker per hour – could be seen in cities outside Paris and Berlin of a similar size to their UK counterparts. The study found that investment was also spread more evenly across a wide range of US cities, which have performed well after benefiting from local financial support and, more recently, the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and Chips Act, which offer more than £800bn worth of subsidies over 10 years. Lyon and Frankfurt were ranked more highly than Birmingham and Manchester and made the difference between the UK being the top-ranked G7 economy behind the US and remaining a middle-ranking country. Canada, Italy and Japan were ranked lower than the UK, according to a measure of output per hour. In a report titled Climbing the Summit: Big Cities in the UK and G7, the thinktank said London was flagging as a consistent provider of income and wealth to the rest of the nation, leaving other cities even more exposed. It urged the next government to focus on a broader investment programme to help consolidate digital industries in regional cities. Andrew Carter, the thinktank’s chief executive, said: “The message for policymakers is to take note of why the US, France and Germany perform so much better than the UK. While not the exclusive reason, a major part of this is the success of their big cities. “The size of cities like Manchester and Birmingham means they should have an advantage in attracting cutting-edge businesses. This is exactly what cities like Chicago, Munich and Lyon do, offering access to skilled workers, high-quality office space and ‘spillover’ benefits from neighbouring firms.” Carter said ministers should give cities the power to physically expand, allowing them to build attractive suburbs near public transport links. These areas could attract businesses and especially firms with high levels of pay that export their services, such as finance, graphic design, marketing, software and publishing. The report said “urban areas where more clustering of knowledge happens tend to be more productive”. In 2022, a measure of G7 productivity as a proportion of annual national income ranked the UK as fourth behind the US, Germany and France. UK productivity was about 16% below the US and Germany. “There are 112 cities in the G7 the size of Nottingham or larger, but of the bottom twenty for productivity, seven are British. They are in effect the sick men of the G7, with the recent stuttering of London adding to the UK’s woes,” the report said. A ranking of cities with service industries that rely on staff with digital skills found the UK was the lowest of the G7. The G7 summit takes place in the city of Fasano from Thursday to Saturday. Last year Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, scrapped the northern leg of the HS2 high-speed rail project between Birmingham and Manchester in a move seen as a setback to efforts to level up the economic imbalance between the south-east of England and other parts of the UK. In a submission to parliament, the thinktank said: “If the goal is to improve the economic performance of the North then it will only be successful if HS2 is treated as a small part of a broader package of investment. “The focus should be on investment in the skills of local populations via FE [further education] colleges and spending on transport within cities.”",

        "content": "The owner of South West Water has warned that global heating will increase the risk of outbreaks of the parasite that caused diarrhoea and vomiting in south Devon. Pennon Group said that “gradual and significant increasing average and high temperatures” could pose “risks to water quality and water treatment” – including the cryptosporidium parasite – in its annual report, published this week. The parasite, which spreads from faeces, causes cryptosporidiosis, a disease that often entails fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. The Devon outbreak has put the spotlight on the UK’s water quality, after years of scrutiny of the amount of sewage being dumped in British rivers and seas. It has also become an election issue, and the Conservative party manifesto on Tuesday promised to ban executive bonuses if a water company “has committed a serious criminal breach” and to invest in river restoration. About 17,000 household customers of South West Water near the seaside town of Brixham in south Devon were last month advised to boil their tap water before drinking it, after more than 100 people reported symptoms. Pennon’s report said global heating would increase the likelihood of floods from rain and rising sea levels and lead to more heatwaves and storms, all bringing higher costs. A series of risks to water quality were also listed, including “odour, discolouration, dissolved organics, cryptosporidium”, plus “increased microbe propagation and survivability” and increased invasive species. Each of those problems would require costly maintenance or treatment to rectify. Paul Johnston, of Greenpeace Research Laboratories, said water companies should redirect money away from shareholder dividends and executive bonuses towards increased resilience. “Extreme temperatures will provide greater opportunities for toxic algae and pathogenic and parasitic organisms to appear in water sources and find their way into our water supply,” he said. “This is a significant risk, but blaming this all on climate change is disingenuous. The risk stems largely from our shoddy water supply and distribution system that has suffered from many years of underinvestment by water companies.” In the latest cryptosporidium outbreak, South West Water said that it had started treatment of a tank at the hamlet of Boohay with ultraviolet light, which kills the microbes. It had previously treated a tank at nearby Hillhead. The company has also flushed the pipes and cleaned them using “ice pigging”, which uses a slurry of ice and water to push out any dirt. Before parliament was dissolved ahead of the general election, the MPs’ select committee on environment, food and rural affairs wrote to Susan Davy, Pennon’s chief executive, requesting that she appear before the committee to answer questions over the outbreak. It is unclear whether a new committee will take up the request after the election on 4 July, but Davy would also be likely to face questions about her pay. Despite giving up her annual bonus for 2023 in response to anger over sewage dumping, Davy’s total pay increased by £300,000 as share awards from 2021 vested.",

        "title": "China’s glut of idle property causes headache for the government",
        "content": "All across China, from Beijing in the north, to Shenzhen in the south, millions of newly built homes stand empty and unwanted. There were nearly 391m sq metres of unsold residential property in China as of April, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That is the equivalent of Manchester and Birmingham combined – and then some – sitting as vacant, unwanted property. This glut of idle property has caused a headache for the government, shaken the world’s second largest economy and raised tensions over the purpose of housebuilding in a nation where property investment had been viewed as a safe bet. Since the real estate sector was sent into a tailspin in 2020, caused by the pandemic and a sudden regulatory crackdown, the industry that has traditionally powered about one-quarter of GDP has been in a downward spiral that policymakers have struggled to halt. The crux of the problem is that, with shaky faith in the economy and big property developers failing to deliver on paid-for apartments, potential homebuyers are keeping their money out of the market. In one recent Weibo post, a user wrote: “In this magical country, investment = gambling. No matter what you invest in, whether it’s buying a house or opening a small shop, if you lose money or go bankrupt, it has nothing to do with the country. It’s all your own fault for wanting to gamble.” The post has since been censored. Local authorities have tried various tactics to encourage people to roll the dice on the property market once more. Shenyang in north-east China is offering 100 yuan (£11) a sqmetre subsidies for some homebuyers. Kaifeng in central Henan province is offering an income tax refund to anyone who buys a new property within a year of selling their old one. Changhsa, the capital of Hunan province, is encouraging developers to offer no-questions-asked refunds of housing deposits if a buyer changes their mind within seven days. None of them have worked. Between January and April, sales of newly built residential properties were down more than 30% on last year. That is a big problem, especially for the already overleveraged property developers whose cash is now tied up in unsold housing stock, pushing the developers to the brink of bankruptcies. The government was forced to step in. Last month, the state-owned People’s Bank of China (PBOC) unveiled a 300bn yuan relending fund to support local governments and state-owned enterprises to buy up unsold stock and turn it into affordable housing. The central bank also lowered the minimum downpayment required for prospective buyers. Tao Ling, an official with the PBOC, said that local state-owned enterprises would be encouraged to use the funds to buy “reasonably priced” homes and turn them into affordable accommodation. But analysts say that the stimulus – Beijing’s most aggressive yet – will be a drop in the ocean compared with the real estate sector’s woes. And local governments, which are already saddled by $13tn (£10tn) of debt, are unlikely saviours when they are also under pressure to balance their books. “The scale of this policy is really way too small to really provide more affordable housing to the people who need it,” says Dan Wang, the chief economist of Hang Seng Bank. The policy is “more about containing the risk” for property developers than boosting the housing market, argues Wang. Andrew Collier, the managing director at Orient Capital Research, a financial research company, says that previous attempts to redevelop slum housing in China’s sprawling cities have encountered difficulties because of corruption and the lack of financial viability for local authorities. “Although the will may be there in the central government, local governments, which actually disbursed the funds in the previous programme, are in a weaker fiscal position,” Collier says. “While these local players are desperate to prove they can continue to deliver growth, they will be struggling with other priorities and unwilling to add to their debt obligations for investments that won’t provide any long-term profits.” Last year, a pilot scheme involving eight cities received little interest. Local authorities often do not see affordable housing initiatives as being commercially viable. State media reports indicated that only a fraction of the 100bn yuan made available in the voluntary scheme was used. Analysts expect the nationwide scheme to be similarly lacklustre Even if local governments did want to hoover up all, or most of, the vacant housing, the newly available lending would not be sufficient. Based on the average price a sq metre for newly built homes in China, the value of the unsold stock is more than 4.3tn yuan, far outstripping the 300bn yuan stimulus. The authorities “know there isn’t really market demand” for the acres of unsold property, says Alicia García-Herrero, the chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, an investment bank. The relending facility is just a way of “avoiding additional problems”. García-Herrero expects that there will be more fiscal reform to boost the impact of the policy, likely at the long delayed meeting of the Chinese Communist party’s central committee in July. As part of the efforts to cool what was once an overheated housing market, the government has stressed the mantra that “houses are for living in, not for speculation”. By that metric, the government has had some success. The average time it takes to sell a new home in China’s wealthiest cities is now over two years, up from less than 10 months in 2017. In the capital, the average time it takes to sell is around four years. But now the market has cooled too much. And “the central government does not have a lot of options to turn around the property market,” Collier says. “It’s a giant hole that sucks in money.”",

        "title": "Four major UK supermarkets accused of misleading ‘freshly baked’ bread claim",
        "content": "They were the best thing since sliced bread. Supermarket bakeries, with their aroma of oven-hot goods, attracted customers who wanted a fresher product than the standard pre-packed offering. But campaigners have cast doubt on just how fresh these baked goods are, with four big supermarkets accused of misleading claims and breaches of consumer protection regulations. The Real Bread Campaign, run by Sustain, has submitted a trading standards complaint over how Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Lidl and the Co-op are marketing their bakery products. Of Sainsbury’s, the group said that its bakery section products use claims including “freshly made every day” and “freshly baked bread”. The supermarket giant is switching from scratch baking, essentially making products from basic ingredients, to rebaking bread made elsewhere, which the campaign group says means the “claims are increasingly unrepresentative of the company’s in-store bakeries in general”. Last month, Sainsbury’s announced that more of its in-store bakeries would move to a “bake-off model” as part of wider proposals that could see 1,500 roles cut across the business. The supermarket did not respond to a question from the Guardian about how many of its stores still use baking from scratch. A spokesperson said the company reviewed its “bakery services and recipes earlier this year” to ensure “good food affordable for everyone”. The spokesperson said: “More of our stores now bake pre-prepared dough in-store, as it allows us to offer customers the best quality in-store bakery products at great value. Our bakery items are also clearly labelled in line with legislation and trading standards.” On Monday 10 June, the campaign group submitted a complaint to Oxfordshire county council trading standards. It has made similar complaints about Tesco, with the group accusing the supermarket of misleading claims including saying “expertly baked in store since 1968”, and “baking fresh from our ovens every day” on packaging, store displays and its website. The Real Bread Campaign claims Tesco uses such marketing at stores where no bread is freshly baked from scratch on-site, at which baking expertise is not required, and in ones that did not exist in 1968. Tesco bakeries have products made from scratch in 400 out of almost 3,000 UK stores. A Tesco spokesperson said: “In some stores where we don’t have the space to bake everything from scratch, we work closely with our bakery suppliers who prepare dough for us that trained colleagues bake every day in store. “The signage we use in each individual store reflects the different ways we prepare bread, and our approach has been agreed with our trading standards primary authority.” There are regulations protecting consumers from falsely described or presented foods, and it is primarily down to trading standards to enforce the law. The campaign also challenged Lidl’s use of claims including “our fresh in-store bakery” and “baked for you throughout the day” despite not baking any bread fresh from scratch at any of its UK stores. Instead, pre-made products are put into ovens to be baked for a second time for a browner, crisper crust, the group said. Lidl has been approached for comment. A complaint was also submitted about how the Co-op labelled and marketed its “freshly prepared”, “sourdough” baguette, which the campaign understood was manufactured and baked by a third party and then baked again in Co-op stores. Four months later, the Real Bread Campaign claims it is still chasing a resolution from Manchester city council, the company’s primary authority for trading standards. A Co-op spokesperson said: “As a convenience retailer, we pride ourselves on offering an affordable and great quality in-store bakery range for our member owners and customers – including our much-loved Irresistible sourdough baguette which is freshly prepared and baked by trained colleagues across our stores every day.” Manchester city council said it is looking at the referral and has been in contact with the Co-op and the Real Bread campaign.",

        "title": "Two former BHS directors ordered to pay at least £18m over wrongful trading",
        "content": "Two former directors of the collapsed department store chain BHS have been ordered to pay at least £18m after the pair were found liable for wrongful trading and breaching their corporate duties. The ruling against Lennart Henningson and Dominic Chandler, members of the Retail Acquisitions team that bought BHS for £1 from Philip Green in 2015, comes eight years after the retailer collapsed into administration owing creditors, including its pension fund, more than £1bn. A hearing relating to a further director, Dominic Chappell – the thrice-bankrupt leader of Retail Acquisitions who spent millions of pounds from BHS on a yacht, a Bentley Continental and other luxuries – is expected later this month. He was jailed for six years in 2020 over “brazen” non-payment of tax. He was released late last year but returned to prison in March after breaching his licence conditions by partnering with the chef Marco Pierre White and his son to set up a trio of restaurants. FRP Advisory, the firm acting as liquidator to BHS, brought the case against the directors on behalf of creditors and said the £13m wrongful trading award it had won from Henningson and Chandler was the largest since the introduction of the Insolvency Act 1986. Wrongful trading occurs when a company’s directors have continued to trade despite knowing there was no reasonable prospect that the company could avoid insolvency. A 533-page high court judgment by Justice Leech indicates that, on top of the £13m, the pair have been ordered to pay a further £5m for breaching their corporate duties. The £5m is the first time a claim of so-called misfeasance trading has been successfully recognised in the UK, FRP said. Henningson and Chandler – along with Chappell – may have to pay an even larger amount of up to £133.5m combined, which would ultimately be handed to creditors. That award, which Leech said Chappell could be liable for half of, relates to the directors breaching their fiduciary duties by continuing to trade rather than putting BHS into an insolvency process, thus failing to promote the success of the company in not considering the interests of their creditors. A final decision on the overall amount the former directors will have to pay will be made after a further hearing later this month. The retailer’s creditors include the employees’ pension fund and its former suppliers. Henningson and Chandler said they had £20m of insurance cover including defence costs. Leech said he recognised this would not be sufficient to cover the amount they had to pay, including costs. He said he agreed with the liquidator’s legal representative who said “to do so would be to send the wrong message to risk-taking directors that they could escape liability if they did not obtain adequate cover to indemnify themselves against wrongful trading”. A former bankrupt and former racing driver with no retail experience, Chappell bought BHS from the billionaire Green for £1 in March 2015. Just a year into his ownership, the chain collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a £571m pensions black hole. In 2020, Chappell was ordered to pay £9.5m into the BHS pension schemes after he failed in his appeal against a ruling by the Pensions Regulator, which had already secured a £363m cash settlement with Green to rescue the schemes. Green, once well known for his high-profile parties, retreated from public life after the collapse of his Topshop empire in 2020. He paid £8m to settle claims against former BHS directors including Darren Topp, the chief executive who stayed on after Green sold the business. A lengthy parliamentary select committee investigation into the collapse of BHS in 2016 found that its demise had created “many losers” including its employees, the 20,000 members of its pension scheme, and “the reputation of business”. But its concluding report added: “The episode is not, however, without winners. Many of those closest to the decisions that led to the collapse of BHS have walked away greatly enriched despite the company’s failure.” A spokesperson for FRP said the legal action was part of its efforts “to readdress that balance” and its efforts had “led to very substantial recoveries for the estate including, in particular, the Pension Protection Fund”. Lynn Dunne, a dispute resolution partner at global law firm Ashurst, said: “The success of the wrongful trading claim and a finding that the directors acted in breach of their duty to promote the success of the company is a coup for the liquidators. Succeeding in these types of heavy fact-specific claims is extremely rare and, indeed, most never make it to trial, not least given the difficulties in proving both causation and loss.”",

        "title": "Strong wage growth will further delay cut in UK interest rates, City believes",
        "content": "Persistently strong wage pressure is set to delay a cut in interest rates until well after the election despite mounting evidence that the UK jobs market is cooling, the City believes. Financial markets indicate that traders expect the Bank of England will hold off reducing the cost of borrowing from 5.25% until it is convinced earnings growth has decisively fallen from levels seen as incompatible with hitting the government’s 2% inflation target. Earlier this year, markets were pencilling in four quarter-point rate cuts but now expect two at the most, with the first not until the late summer or early autumn. Annual pay was 5.9% higher in the three months to April than a year earlier, unchanged on the March figure, but for the private sector the rate of growth eased from 6.1% to 5.8%. The earnings data was in contrast with the rest of the Office for National Statistics report, which showed unemployment up by 138,000 in the three months to April and the unemployment rate at 4.4% – its highest in more than two and a half years. In the last set of labour market figures before the general election, job vacancies also continued to fall – dropping by 12,000 to 904,000 in the three months to May. Meanwhile, the number of people not working because of long-term ill health was up by 55,000 to a record 2.83 million. Despite the near 10% increase in the national minimum wage, which affected more than 3 million workers, there was tentative evidence that pay growth may have peaked. In April alone, earnings overall were 5.5% up on the same month in 2023, compared with 6.4% in the year to March. In the private sector, the annual increase was 5% in April, down from 6.8% in the year to March. Pay in real terms is rising because wages are increasing faster than the annual inflation rate, which was 2.3% in April. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said: “The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%. The recent weakening in demand for staff has been attributed to a lack of roles and firms delaying hiring decisions. This is consistent with a broader trend of retaining existing labour, and could signal that firms expect a pickup in activity so that they could utilise their existing staff more.” Using data provided by HMRC, the ONS said its early estimate for May showed the number of employees falling by 3,000, although the total was 167,000 up on a year earlier. Stephen Evans, the chief executive at the Learning and Work Institute, said: “The last labour market stats before the election show a further drop in employment and rise in economic inactivity. “Some 3.2 million people are out of work but want a job: the next government needs to widen employment support to all who want to work, given today only one in 10 out-of-work disabled people get help to find work each year. “Average earnings are rising in real terms as inflation falls but are a staggering £12,000 a year below what they’d be on pre-financial crisis trends. This shows the scale of catch-up needed in the years ahead.” Liz Kendall, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “Today’s figures confirm that the Tories have no hiding place after 14 years of abject failure. Labour’s plan will get Britain working by cutting NHS waiting lists, introducing a new national jobs and careers service, making work pay and supporting people into good jobs across every part of the country.” Nye Cominetti, the principal economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said it was worrying that employment was closer to its mid-pandemic lows, than its pre-pandemic highs. “Turning around this poor performance, and kickstarting the kind of jobs growth Britain experienced in the 2010s will be a key task for the next government,” he said. “But while the jobs market weakens, pay packets remain resilient. This recent spurt of real wage growth, the strongest in an almost a decade, will be a relief to workers and a worry for the Bank of England. But it can’t be sustained unless productivity picks up.”",

        "title": "Severn Trent boss paid £3.2m despite firm’s fine for sewage spills in river",
        "content": "The boss of Severn Trent Water has been awarded a £3.2m pay deal, including a £584,000 bonus, despite the company being fined £2m for spilling 260m litres of sewage into the River Trent. Liv Garfield, who has been the head of the utility firm for a decade, saw her pay increase by 2.1%, bringing her total take-home pay during her time as Severn boss to more than £28m. Garfield received just over 60% of the total amount of bonus she was eligible for during the year to the end of March. The reward was curbed in part because Severn did not hit environmental targets due to the £2m fine this year. Severn, which serves 4.6m households and businesses from Bristol to the Humber, and mid-Wales to the east Midlands, was fined by Ofwat in February for polluting the River Trent between November 2019 and February 2020. Ofwat’s investigation found that the Strongford treatment works in Stoke-on-Trent discharged more than 260m litres of sewage, the equivalent of 10 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Last month Garfield was forced to defend her pay packet while telling the BBC that the 60,000 spills Severn was responsible for in 2023 did not make her feel good. The news of Garfield’s bonus comes just a day after it was revealed that Susan Davy, the boss of South West Water’s parent company, Pennon, received a £300,000 pay increase, despite an outbreak of diarrhoea caused by a parasite in Devon’s water supply. The increase came despite Pennon executives agreeing to forgo bonuses due to its poor performance on sewage dumping. The UK’s three main political parties have all promised tough action on water companies and their bosses who dump sewage in waterways. The Conservative manifesto, which was published on Tuesday, pledged to work with the regulator to hold companies to account and ban executive bonuses if a company has committed a serious criminal breach. On Monday, the Liberal Democrats’ manifesto promised to convert water companies into public benefit companies and “ban bonuses for bosses until the discharges and leaks end”. It comes as the environmental campaigner Feargal Sharkey called for a public inquiry into the water industry and claimed that they were “scamming” customers. Speaking at a fringe event at the GMB annual conference in Bournemouth, the former Undertones singer said: “We have ended up with every river in England being polluted, while £72bn of your money has been stripped out.” He added that every chief executive of a water company and the regulator should be “hauled” before a public inquiry. A Severn Trent spokesperson said: “Delivering for our customers, our communities and the environment underpins our approach to remuneration. “Just under three-quarters of executive pay is directly linked to performance, with stretching targets in place. “In 2023-24 we maintained our position as a sector-leading performer, delivering against our operational targets for customers, investing £1.2bn across our region and achieving a four-star rating from the Environmental Agency for a fourth consecutive year.”",

        "title": "The PwC scandal sparked scrutiny of advisory firms. Is Australia’s consulting sector about to see a reckoning? ",
        "content": "A federal inquiry is due to release its final report into consulting services on Wednesday in long-awaited findings that could redefine how the sector operates in Australia after the PwC tax leaks scandal. The parliamentary committee is set to address issues of accountability and regulation in its recommendations, as it grapples with the risks posed to the public sector by the growing reliance on a small number of consultants. The final report will also address the transparency of work undertaken by consultants and measures required to prevent conflicts of interest, according to the terms of reference. What sparked the Senate inquiry? The inquiry was triggered by allegations PwC Australia used its role as a government adviser to obtain confidential information to help its international clients avoid tax, rubbing against attempts by authorities to combat the rise of tax havens and other opaque structures. The scandal raised questions about the structure of the broader professional services sector, dominated by the big four – PwC, Deloitte, EY and KPMG – and apparent conflicts of interests. The inquiry heard that the practice of advising government departments on the design of tax laws, while creating tax arrangements for clients, created a potentially devastating conflict. In PwC’s case, the alleged breaches occurred despite there being confidentiality arrangements in place. PwC has since divested its entire government consulting business in Australia and retrenched staff while it faces multiple investigations. It has also overhauled its internal governance structures, although the bipartisan Senate committee has described some of the changes as largely “symbolic”. Why are the issues important? The scrutiny of PwC showed there was a heavy reliance by government departments on a handful of firms, exposing the apparent hollowing out of the public service. Consultancy firms have been described as “a shadow public service” and the inquiry was warned they may be tailoring advice to earn more money, instead of giving frank and fearless advice in the best interests of taxpayers. Professional services firms are paid by the government to provide policy advice and are then often retained to help implement the recommendations. At the same time, separate divisions within the firms charge businesses for their insights and specialist knowledge. The issue also shone a light on potential tax avoidance, which can deprive a country of anticipated income, an area of significant focus for the Australian Taxation Office in recent years. Cross-border tax avoidance occurs when a company declares profits in a low-tax jurisdiction when the income was generated in a higher-taxing country. What has the inquiry found so far? There have been two interim reports, both critical of PwC. The first recounted a “calculated breach of trust” and called on PwC to cooperate fully with investigators, while being “open and honest” with the parliament and public. The second accused PwC of attempting to cover up the tax leaks scandal and criticised extensive leadership failures by the firm’s former executives. The parliamentary committee and PwC’s head office have clashed over the professional services firm’s refusal to comply with a request from the federal parliament to release a report detailing the actions of international partners, citing legal professional privilege. While the committee members have accused PwC of hiding behind legal privilege in order to contain the fallout to the Australian operations, the firm has argued it has a “basic legal right” to not release the report. PwC was contacted for comment on Tuesday. The firm has previously said it had taken considerable steps to transform, which includes the appointment of an independent board chair – being the first big four consulting firm to do so in Australia.",

        "title": "Pre-election UK interest rate cut unlikely despite cooling jobs market and rising mortgage arrears; Moody’s warns France over snap election – as it happened",
        "content": "Time for a recap: Hopes that UK interest rates could be cut before July’s election are fading, after UK real wages grew at their fastest pace since 2021. The money markets indicate there’s only a 10% chance that the Bank of England lowers borrowing costs next week. Rate cuts are unlikely after the latest labour market data showed a pick-up in real wages, while nominal earnings rose at the same pace as a month ago. Pay held up despite the number of people unemployed in the UK rising by 138,000 in the three months to April amid growing signs of a weaker jobs market. In the last set of labour market figures before the general election, the Office for National Statistics said employment and job vacancies were down and joblessness had increased. Economists warned that the UK workforce was sicker and poorer than at the start of the parliament, after the number of people off work with long-term sickness hit a new high. Sir Keir Starmer said he was confident that interest rates would fall under a Labour government. Elsewhere, anxiety over political instability in France has hit the financial markets again today. Moody’s warned that the French snap parliamentary elections are negative for the country’s credit rating, adding: “Potential political instability is a credit risk given the challenging fiscal picture the next government will inherit.” French bonds have weakened again today, while European stock markets are on track for their biggest one-day drop in two months. And in other news… French bank shares are having another poor day, amid the worries over the political outlook for the EU’s second largest economy. Credit Agricole are down 4%, while Société Générale have lost 4.15% and BHP Paribas is off 3.3%. Moody’s warning that France’s snap parliamentary elections are a “credit negative” event (see 9.27am) has refocused attention on the prospect of the far-right National Rally party potentially becoming the largest party. There is an irony in today’s earnings figures – in that, while it’s excellent news that pay is rising faster than inflation, it does dampen the prospects of a cut to borrowing costs… Over in Brazil, inflation has nudged higher. Official data released today shows that prices rose by 3.93% in the year to May, up from 3.69% in April. In May along, prices rose by 0.46%. This ends a seven-month stretch of falling inflation, and will increase the pressure on Brazil’s central bank to leave interest rates on hold next week, at 10.5%. Alison Rose, who lost her job running NatWest in the debanking row with Nigel Farage last summer, has a new role – senior adviser at private equity firm Charterhouse. Private Equity News are reporting that Charterhouse, the London based private equity investment firm [not to be confused with chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s private school…] appointed Rose in April. News of the appointment comes nearly a year after Rose resigned, after admitting she had been the source of a controversial BBC story about Farage’s bank accounts. PE News says: Rose was a rare example of a female chief executive of a major bank, having taken the reins of NatWest from Ross McEwan in November 2019. A regular on Private Equity News sister publication Financial News’s 100 Women in Finance, she last made the cut in 2022 as she was ousted from the state-owned bank before the 2023 list was released. Rose did not get “good leaver” status, the bank confirmed on 10 November, meaning she went without nearly £7.6m in unvested share awards and bonuses for 2023. Last December, she also had her name removed from a government-backed review into female entrepreneurship. Shares have fallen further in London today, putting the blue-chip FTSE 100 share index on track for its worst day in almost two months. The FTSE 100 is now down 82 points, or 1%, at 8146 points, its lowest since early May. That would be its biggest one-day drop since 16th April. European stock markets have also dropped deeper into the red, as invesstos are spooked by the political turmoil in France. The euro has dropped to its lowest level in around six weeks; it’s down 0.3% at $1.0733, adding to Monday’s losses after Emmanual Macron called a snap election after a significant defeat by the far-right in the EU vote. The revolving door between Whitehall and British industry is spinning like a wind turbine, with energy company EDF appointing former top civil servant Sir Alex Chisholm KCB as its chairman. Chisholm only recently stepped down as chief operating officer for the civil service in April, effectively its second-in-command. He also served as Permanent Secretary to the Business Department from 2016 to 2020, where he worked on the plan to build Hinkley Point C power station – which is running late and over budget, and for which EDF has taken a €12.9bn (£11bn) impairment charge. Chisholm was also chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority from 2013 to 2016. Simone Rossi, EDF’s UK CEO, says appointing Chisholm will help EDF hit its net zero goals: “EDF will be tackling some of the most significant opportunities and challenges associated with assuring Great Britain’s future needs for a secure, low carbon, more electric economy. Sir Alex brings great private and public-sector leadership, governance and regulatory experience that can help steer the company’s efforts to help Britain achieve net zero.” Newsflash: The Opec cartel has trimmed its estimate for oil demand growth in the first quarter of this year, but is maintaining its forecast for 2024 as a whole. In its latest monthly report, Opec forecast that world oil demand will rise by 2.25m barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 and by 1.85 million bpd in 2025, the same as a month ago. OPEC lowered its estimate of total demand in the first quarter of this year by 50,000 bpd to 103.51 million bpd, but increased its forecast for the second quarter by 50,000 bpd, meaning no change in the overall forecast. Opec said the stability in the services sector would support demand for energy, explaining: “It is projected to be the main contributor to the economic growth dynamic in the second half of 2024, particularly. supported by travel and tourism, with a consequent positive impact on oil demand.” Strikes by British workers fell to the lowest in more than two years ahead of the general election on 4 July, Bloomberg reports. They say: The number of days lost to strikes dropped to 17,000 in April, the lowest since February 2022 and down sharply from the levels seen at the peak of industrial strife after inflation hit double digits. The respite may be short-lived, with junior doctors planning industrial action and unions warning of more walkouts regardless of who wins the election. Economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon points out that UK mortgage arrears are still well below the levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis, despite rising to an eight year high today (see 10.25am): Interest rates would come down under a Labour government, Sir Keir Starmer has said, after economists criticised Rishi Sunak for making a similar claim, PA Media reports. Asked whether he was confident interest rates would fall if Labour came to power, Sir Keir told reporters he was, as his party would “stabilise the economy”. He added: “That’s why we’ve set out our six steps which are the things that we will do on July 5, on the first day if we get the opportunity, and the first thing is to stabilise the economy, for the very reason I said. “If you lose control of the economy it’s working people who pay the price and I’m not prepared to let that happen.” The money markets are predicting rate cuts in 2025, as well as one this year. UK interest rates are forecast to drop to around 4.25% by the end of next year, which implies four quarter-point rate cuts over the next 18 months. UK tech firm Raspberry Pi has made a sparkling stock market debut. Cambridge-based Raspberry Pi, which sells low-cost computers aimed at helping children to learn about computing, has floated in London at a market capitalisation of £541.6m, or 280p per share. And traders are piling into the company, pushing up its share price by a third to 370p. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, says the float proves the UK can attract tech flotations: “Investors of all shapes and sizes have feasted on a slice of Raspberry Pi in what is the most significant IPO for the London market for a long time. It may only fall into smaller company territory, but this IPO is big from a strategic perspective. “It shows the UK is open for business to technology flotations and that investors are hungry for companies of any size if they tick the right boxes. There is a widely held view that tech companies only float in the US where they can potentially get a higher valuation. Raspberry Pi is proof that the UK can still compete against the likes of the Nasdaq and attract home-grown champions. “Raspberry Pi is a profitable, established name and not reliant on the ‘jam tomorrow’ story that often props up a lot of tech IPOs. It has a large community of users; it makes money rather than simply being a bright idea that is not yet commercialised; and there is a strong social angle as Raspberry Pi has education built into its business model. “The UK market is woefully under-represented in tech names and hopefully Raspberry Pi’s IPO success will open the flood gates for others in the sector to also float here. If the London Stock Exchange wants a new posterchild for how IPOs should play out and to attract others onto the market, Raspberry Pi is the one to hold up high.” The pound has hit a new 22-month high against the euro. Sterling has climbed above €1.185 against the single currency today, boosting the spending power of Brits heading to the continent this summer. That’s a gain of 0.25% today, to the highest level since August 2022. European stock markets are in the red again. The UK’s FTSE 100 has dropped to its lowest level since the end of last month, down 55 points or -0.7% at 8174 points. Miners and banks are leading the fallers, with Antofagasta down 3%, Standard Chartered losing 2.9% and Glencore off 2.8%. European markets are also weaker again, with France’s CAC40 dropping another 0.55% and Germany’s DAX losing 0.4%. Traders are nursing fears that the US central bank may not cut interest rates as soon as hoped. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The Federal Reserve (Fed) starts its two-day meeting today and is widely expected to trim its rate cutting projections for this year due to sticky inflation and still-tight jobs market. The US dollar index spiked past its 50-DMA following last Friday’s surprisingly strong jobs data, and is consolidating gains above this level ahead of tomorrow’s most important CPI data and the Fed announcement. Provided the economic data and the inflation trends, there is a greater chance that we hear a hawkish Fed statement than the contrary. The gap between Paris and Berlin’s borrowing costs are widening again…. That suggests bond investors are seeing French bonds as riskier, given the uncertainty created by the snap elections announced on Sunday. Worryingly, the number of UK mortgages in arrears has risen to a seven-year high. New Bank of England data shows that 1.28% of loans were in arrears in the first quarter of 2024, up from 1.23% in the previous three months. That’s the highest reading since the fourth quarter of 2016, and suggests more households are strugging to meet their mortgage payments due to high interest rates. The value of outstanding mortgage balances with arrears increased by 4.2% from the previous quarter to £21.3bn – a 44.5% increase compared with a year earlier. This is the highest reading in almost a decade, since the third quarter of 2014. Simon Gammon, managing partner at Knight Frank Finance, said: “The value of mortgage balances in arrears has surged as household finances have come under pressure from both higher mortgage rates and the rising cost of various goods and services. This is serious for people struggling to pay their mortgage, but it doesn’t yet present a systemic risk to the housing market. The proportion of the total loan balances in arrears is still relatively low at 1.28%, though Bank of England policymakers will be watching this data closely. New arrears cases actually dipped a little during the quarter, which suggests the situation may be stabilising. “Mortgage rates are currently trading sideways and barring any nasty surprises, should continue easing once the timing of the Bank of England’s first cut to the base rate becomes clearer. “Anybody concerned about falling behind on their mortgage payments should contact their lender as early as possible. The lenders have received strict instructions from regulators to offer forbearance, whether via extending mortgage terms or temporarily switching to interest only payments.” ING developed markets economist, James Smith, suspects the financial markets are underpricing the chances of a UK interest rate cut this summer: Smith explains: “The UK jobs market is cooling quite noticeably now, and that makes it all the more surprising that financial markets are pricing just a 7% probability of a rate cut next week and only 46% for August’s meeting. We think a summer rate cut is much more likely. Today’s hiring figures back this up, Smith argues, although he points out there are still “major question marks” surrounding the quality of the data. Taken at face value, the rise in the unemployment rate from 3.8% at the end of last year to 4.4% now is pretty eye-catching. But the very pronounced fall in the response rate to the Labour Force Survey and potential bias in the achieved sample means it is still hard to know how seriously to take these latest numbers. But the data on unemployment corresponds with the ongoing fall in job openings, and the vacancy-to-unemployment rate is now back down to pre-Covid levels. An alternative measure of employment using firms’ payroll data shows it flat to slightly negative so far this year. Although real wages are growing a faster rate this year (as inflation falls), they’re still below their levels before the cost of living crisis, points out Hannah Slaughter, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation: French government bonds are weakening again this morning, adding to losses yesterday. With prices falling, the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year French government bonds has risen to 3.28%, up four basis points (or 0.04 percentage points) from last night. That’s the highest levels since last November. These 10-year bond yields, a measure of French government borrowing costs, ended last week at 3.12%, but jumped on Monday, before rising again today. Rising bond yields reflect investor nervousness about the political uncertainty in France created by Emmanual Macron’s decision to dissolve the French parliament and hold snap elections. Christophe Jakubyszyn of French financial newspaper Les Echos has argued that Macron acted too quickly, with a “crazy” dissolution which risks leaving the door wide open to the far right. Across the Channel, ratings agency Moody’s has warned the French government that its snap parliamentary elections are negative for the country’s credit score. In a statement, Moody’s warns: “This snap election increases risks to fiscal consolidation.” President Emmanual Macron shocked Europe by announcing the parliamentary election, just a few hours after learning that his centrist allies had been pummelled in European elections, while the far right Rally National had secured twice as many votes, around 32%. Moody’s suggests that its current “stable” outlook on France’s rating could be cut to “negative” if its debt metrics worsened further, saying: “Potential political instability is a credit risk given the challenging fiscal picture the next government will inherit. A weakening commitment to fiscal consolidation would also increase downward credit pressures”. An opinion poll last night suggested that National Rally was on track to win the snap election in France but fall short of an absolute majority. If RN were to win a majority, Macron will be forced to name a RN deputy as prime minister — leading to a period of so-called “cohabitation” between the parliament and the Élysée Palace. Modupe Adegbembo and Mohit Kumar of Jefferies say: Such an outcome would leave Macron in an even weaker position to push through much need economic reforms including changes to unemployment benefits and fiscal consolidation. Even in a situation in which Macron is able to still command a majority, it hard to think he will not end up in an even weaker position after this. The Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates before next month’s general election, the money markets indicate today. There’s just a 10% chance that the BoE lowers base rate to 5%, from 5.25%, at its meeting a week on Thursday. (20 June), according to the latest City pricing. That’s little changed from last night, before this morning’s data showed the labour market is cooling, with unemployment rising again to 4.4%. The Bank is then due to set rates in August, September, November and December. And this morning, the markets now expect the first rate cut to come by November. Before 7am today, the first cut was only fully priced in for December. The complication for the Bank is that it wants to see more evidence that inflationary pressures are cooling. A weaker jobs market will help with that, but wage stickiness – earnings are rising at around 6% per year - will not. So, the fact that wage growth slowed in April alone – despite being unchanged over the February-April quarter – could nudge some policymakers towards considering easing policy this year, if the trend continues. Yael Selfin, KPMG’s chief economist, says today’s “mixed labour market data” is unlikely to shift the dial for the BoE this month: The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%. The recent weakening in demand for staff has been attributed to a lack of roles and firms delaying hiring decisions. This is consistent with a broader trend of retaining existing labour, and could signal that firms expect a pickup in activity so that they could utilise their existing staff more. “Overall, today’s data are unlikely to warrant an immediate shift in policy from the Bank of England. We expect the MPC to stay put at its June meeting and reassess the incoming data flow over the summer before it embarks on cutting interest rates.” Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, agrees that hopes of a pre-election interest rate cut have faded: “Sterling largely held its own off the back of the data, as while rapidly rising wages could delay the start to Bank of England interest rate cuts, the increase in joblessness bodes ill for the UK’s growth outlook. “This will not be particularly welcome news for Rishi Sunak’s Tory Party, who appear to have based their call for early elections on the strength of Britain’s recent economic data.” RSM UK economist Thomas Pugh argues that the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) should cut rates in August: “Today’s data will make pretty uncomfortable reading for the MPC. But it is clear the labour market is loosening and forward-looking indicators suggest pay growth will slow, combined with a further fall in inflation in May, that should be enough to justify the Bank of England following the ECB with a rate cut in August. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, says the Bank will be nervous about sparking another bout of inflation, by cutting rates too early: “The BoE will be incredibly cautious to cut rates at a period when spending power is high for consumers and potentially triggering a fresh inflationary bout. As such, today’s data will continue to put a dampener on a rate cut in June or August, with November remaining the likeliest date to see that first fall. There are signs in today’s UK labour market report that wage growth has slowed, despite looking sticky. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Annual growth in average earnings in the three months to April was 5.9% for all workers – unchanged on the three months to March – while for the private sector the growth rate eased from 6.1% to 5.8%. In April alone, earnings overall were 5.5% up on the same month in 2023 compared with 6.4% in the year to March. For the private sector, the annual increase was 5% in April, down from 6.8% in the year to March. Pay in real terms is rising because wages are rising faster than the annual inflation rate, which stood at 2.3% in April. Here’s the full story: The next government will have to tackle the problem of falling employment, rather than falling inflation, says the Resolution Foundation thinktank. Resolution point out that the UK unemployment rate has increased for four months in a row – from 3.8% in the last quarter of 2023, to 4.4% in the three months to April 2024 – an increase of 190,000 people out of work. Vacancies have fallen for 23 out of the past 24 months, they add, while the number of employees in the PAYE data has fallen for three out of the past four months, after rising for 35 months in a row. And average earnings remain more than £14,000 a year off their pre-financial crisis path after 16 years of wage stagnation. Nye Cominetti, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, explains: “The labour market has continued to cool in early 2024, with both unemployment and inactivity up. Worryingly, the UK employment is closer to its mid-pandemic lows, than its pre-pandemic highs. “Turning around this poor performance, and kickstarting the kind of jobs growth Britain experienced in the 2010s will be a key task for the next government. “But while the jobs market weakens, pay packets remain resilient. This recent spurt of real wage growth, the strongest in an almost a decade, will be a relief to workers and a worry for the Bank of England. But it can’t be sustained unless productivity picks up.” The fall in UK employment in the last quarter, and the rise in inactivity, shows that the labour market isn’t working for millions of people, explains Stephen Evans, chief executive of the Learning and Work Institute. Evans explains: “The last labour market stats before the election show a further drop in employment and rise in economic inactivity. 3.2 million people are out of work but want a job: the next government needs to widen employment support to all who want to work, given today only 1 in 10 out-of-work disabled people get help to find work each year. Average earnings are rising in real terms as inflation falls, but are a staggering £12,000 per year below what they’d be on pre-financial crisis trends. This shows the scale of catch-up needed in the years ahead.” TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak says: “These damning figures show the Conservatives have taken the jobs market from bad to worse. “Unemployment is rising. Vacancies are falling. Insecure work is at epidemic levels. Record numbers are long-term sick. And wages are still worth less than in 2008. “The Tories have failed working people. We need a government that will rebuild industry, create wage growth, and deliver a better living for working families.” Today’s labour market data shows there will be no time for complacency for the next Government as the UK has a smaller workforce that is poorer and sicker than in 2019. That’s the verdict of Rebecca Florisson, principal analyst at the Work Foundation at Lancaster University. Florisson explains that living standards have not recovered despite strong wage growth: “Annual nominal wage growth was 6%, with the record National Living Wage increase of 9.8% improving the pay of 3.3 million low paid workers. There are signs that the wage growth recovery has peaked. “Despite real wages rising by 2.3% on the year, the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in the Ukraine has made this the first Parliament since 1955 where living standards have declined. The reality is that most people are feeling poorer than when they last voted in the last General Election nearly five years ago. The UK also has a smaller workforce than at the start of the Parliament, Florisson adds: “There are now a record 2.83 million people who are economically inactive due to long-term sickness – 702,000 higher than in January-March 2020. The UK continues to be an international outlier with participation rates well below pre-Covid levels and this trend shows no sign of abating. Pay is rising fastest in the City, and slowest on UK building sites. The ONS explains: In February to April 2024, the finance and business services sector saw the largest annual total pay growth at 6.9%. The construction sector saw the smallest annual total pay growth across sectors, at 2.1%. The rise in unemployment, and in people neither working nor looking for work (economically inactive) is a sign of 14 years of “abject failure” by the government, says Liz Kendall, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary: “Today’s figures confirm that the Tories have no hiding place after 14 years of abject failure. On Rishi Sunak’s watch, a record number of people are out of work due to long-term sickness at terrible cost to them, to business and the taxpayer, and we remain the only G7 country whose employment rate still isn’t back to pre-pandemic levels. Labour’s plan will get Britain working by cutting NHS waiting lists, introducing a new national jobs and careers service, making work pay and supporting people into good jobs across every part of the country. It’s time to stop the chaos, turn the page and start rebuilding Britain.” The increase in the UK minimum wage helped to keep wage growth strong in the last quarter. The national living wage rose by almost 10% at the start of April, to £11.44 an hour, lifting take-home pay for around three million workers. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, says: “Wage growth remained elevated in April as the 10% hike in the National Living Wage was enough to temporarily arrest the downward momentum in pay. Based on today’s release, we estimate that the rise in the National Living Wage boosted the overall level of pay by around 0.1%, although the current headline rate somewhat underestimates the impact because it is reported as a three-month average. “The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%. The recent weakening in demand for staff has been attributed to a lack of roles and firms delaying hiring decisions. This is consistent with a broader trend of retaining existing labour, and could signal that firms expect a pickup in activity so that they could utilise their existing staff more. Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, agrees that the minimum wage increase kept regular pay high: “The punchy 0.6% m/m increase in private sector regular pay in April was enough to keep headline total pay growth at 5.9%. However, we estimate at least half of this monthly increase was due to the one-off 9.7% increase in the national minimum wage. Indeed, the labour market continues to loosen with employment dropping by another 139,000 in the three months to April and the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% Wages are rising slightly faster in the UK public sector than in the private sector, today’s labour market report shows. The Office for National Statistics reports that annual average regular earnings growth for the public sector “remains strong”, at 6.4% in February to April 2024. For the private sector, total regular (ex-bonuses) pay rose by 5.8%, the slowest rate since April to June 2022 (when it was 5.4%). Annual average total earnings growth for the public sector was 6.3% and was 5.8% for the private sector, the ONS adds. The good news for workers is that real wages (ie, after inflation) rose at their fastest rate in almost three years. Adjusted for CPI inflation, total pay (including bonuses) grew by 2.7% per year in February to April 2024, which is the fastest rate since July to September 2021 (when it was 3.0%). Regular pay (which excludes bonuses) rose by 2.9%, the fastest growth since June to August 2021 (when it was 3.4%). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Back when the UK general election was called, today was identified as a key date to take the health of the economy. That’s because the latest labour market data is being released, the first of five pieces of important economic news which will test Rishi Sunak’s claim that his economic plan was working. The data will also be watched at the Bank of England, as well as across Westminster, as central bankers look for evidence that inflationary pressures are esing. And the big news is that unemployment has risen, while wage growth remains stickily high – which may dampen hopes of an early interest rate cut. The Office for National Statistics has reported that the number of people unemployed rose by 138,000 in the February-April quarter, taking the total to just over 1.5 million. This lifts the UK unemployment rate to 4.4%, the highest since July-September 2021. The number of people in work has fallen, by 139,000, to 32.97 million. And 132,000 more people fell out of the labour market altogether, partly due to ill health, taking the total of economically inactive up to 9.434m. That left the economic inactivity rate at 22.3% for the three months to April, up from 22% in the previous quarter. The data also shows that companies are cutting back on hiring, with the number of vacancies in March to May 2024 falling by 12,000 to 904,000. The ONS says: This month’s figures continue to show signs that the labour market may be cooling, with the number of vacancies still falling and unemployment rising, though earnings growth remains relatively strong. But wage growth did not slow, despite this cooling demand for workers. The ONS reports that annual growth in regular earnings (excluding bonuses) was 6.0%, the same as for the previous three-month period; and annual growth in employees’ average total earnings (including bonuses) was 5.9%, the same as for the previous three-month period.

        "title": "Protectionism is slowing growth and entrenching poverty, says World Bank",
        "content": "A new era of protectionism is leading to slower global growth and hindering attempts to eradicate poverty, the World Bank has warned. The Washington-based institution said 80% of the world’s population – more than 6 billion people – were living in countries where growth would be slower in the next three years than in the pre-Covid decade. In its half-yearly global economic prospects, the World Bank said the model of international cooperation that had allowed the poorest countries to close the gap with the wealthiest had fractured. Even though the global economy had avoided recession, it had stabilised at a lower level than in the years leading up to the start of the pandemic. Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist, said policymakers had cause to celebrate a “soft landing” despite the steepest rise in global interest rates since the 1980s. “But they would be wise to keep their eye on the ball: growth rates remain too slow for progress. Without stronger international cooperation and a concerted push for policies that advance shared prosperity, the world could become stuck in the slow lane.” The bank’s forecasts show global growth holding steady at 2.6% in 2024 before edging up to an average of 2.7% in 2025-26. In the pre-Covid decade, growth averaged 3.1%. Gill said progress towards prosperity occurred when governments put in place policies that fostered productivity, entrepreneurship and innovation – and when they did so while cooperating. “That was the model that flourished after the fall of the Berlin Wall. By encouraging the flow of goods, capital, and ideas across borders, it ushered in an extraordinary era of global prosperity: a span of roughly 25 years when the incomes of the poorest nations, on average, were catching up with those of the wealthiest, and when the world came within striking distance of ending extreme poverty,” he said. But Gill added its global economic prospects provided a “sobering assessment” of how the model of international cooperation had been fracturing, pointing to how trade measures designed to restrain cross-border commercial flows were growing at a historic pace. “Four years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,” Gill said. “However, growth is at lower levels than before 2020. Prospects for the world’s poorest economies are even more worrisome. They face punishing levels of debt service, constricting trade possibilities, and costly climate events. Developing economies will have to find ways to encourage private investment, reduce public debt, and improve education, health, and basic infrastructure.” Gill said the world’s 75 poorest countries, eligible for grants or cheap loans from the bank, would not be able to make the necessary progress without international support.",

        "title": "Tata claims steelmaking in south Wales at risk if £500m subsidy is delayed",
        "content": "Tata Steel has claimed that steelmaking in south Wales could be “at significant risk” if a £500m subsidy package is delayed, after the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, called for it to restart talks with a potential Labour government. The Indian company said it was concerned that the government support to replace the polluting blast furnaces with cleaner electric versions may be “put in peril” during the general election campaign, in a statement to London’s stock market on Tuesday. The two blast furnaces in Port Talbot, south Wales, plus another two in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, under Chinese-owned British Steel are among the biggest carbon polluters in the UK, and both companies are planning to switch to new electric arc furnaces which rely on recycled steel. However, the plans have caused concern among politicians and resulted in strike threats from workers because the newer technology requires far fewer workers. Tata insisted that it would not backtrack on plans to make as many as 2,800 workers redundant at Port Talbot and another south Wales site in Llanwern. The first blast furnace is due to close at the end of June, with the loss of the bulk of the jobs in September when the second furnace and the rest of the “heavy end” that transforms iron into steel will close. Tata insisted that extending the lives of the blast furnaces was not possible because they were “operationally unstable and are resulting in unsustainable financial losses”. The company said it was “apprehensive” because of media reports that suggested the electric arc furnace plans “may be put in peril due to policy differences expressed by the Conservative and Labour parties, during the ongoing election period”. Workers have voted in favour of strikes against Tata, but have so far held off in the hope that they can negotiate for more jobs to be kept, as well as better redundancy terms. Alasdair McDiarmid, assistant general secretary of Community, a steelworkers’ union, said: “It would be wrong for Tata to make irreversible decisions before such a consequential election. Again, we urge the company to engage with Labour and the unions to consider alternatives to protect jobs.” The Conservative government has pledged Tata £500m in subsidies, on top of the company’s own £750m investment, but the deal has not been officially completed. Labour, which is well ahead in the polls before the general election on 4 July, is hoping that the company will wait and continue negotiations over options to keep more steel jobs in the UK. Stephen Kinnock, who is running to return as Port Talbot’s local MP, said that Labour was opposed to “any deal that uses £500m of taxpayers’ money to make thousands of steelworkers redundant”. Labour has pledged to spend £3bn helping the steel industry. That would include the £500m already promised – and potentially the same for Scunthorpe – but could also be extended to other technology to retain jobs as well as the UK’s ability to produce steel from iron ore. One notable option would be a facility to produce direct reduced iron that could be fed into electric arc furnaces to make steel. A DRI plant could make near-zero-emissions steel if green hydrogen was used to strip out oxygen from iron ore. However, Tata does not currently plan to add a costly DRI plant, so it would probably push a Labour government hard in negotiations for further subsidies.",

        "title": "‘It should be a right to fix your phone’: the boss of booming secondhand tech firm Back Market",
        "content": "Thibaud Hug de Larauze is waving his iPhone, boasting that it is more than seven years old. “It works great,” he says. Not what you’d expect from a tech entrepreneur heading one of France’s biggest “unicorn” startups – Back Market – which has raised more than $1bn to expand into 18 countries. The chief executive of the secondhand gadget marketplace says he would rather identify as an eco-warrior than a tech guru, fighting to persuade us all to buy pre-owned phones, laptops and other devices, and repair or recycle our old ones. New technology contributes more than 1bn tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year, just under 3% of the global total, making it the seventh biggest contributor – about half the size of the fashion industry – according to Our World in Data. Mending a smartphone just once can save more than 77kg of carbon emissions, research by the French ecological transition agency Ademe has found, helping to lighten our impact on the planet, solve a gigantic electronic waste problem that equates to more than 60m tonnes a year globally, and reduce the need to mine scarce resources, including gold, platinum and palladium. “It’s a big driver to wake up and at the end of the day … know that I’m trying to achieve something that is positive,” Hug de Larauze says. He says that what he likes about the company is that it doesn’t compromise values for value. “The more we grow the business, the best it is in terms of impact.” The group, which has headquarters in Paris and Bordeaux and employs 700 people globally, expects to deliver its first annual underlying profit this year, shortly after its 10th anniversary in November. Sales continue to surge, on the back of 45% growth last year to €320m (£270m), which makes the company about a quarter of the size of UK online electrical goods retailer AO. The UK, where Back Market opened for business four years ago, is now its fastest growing country – with sales up 80% year on year. The group holds 44% of Britain’s online refurbished tech market, rising to more than half for smartphones. Hug de Larauze says interest has surged in the UK because people are “fighting inflation and so looking for options to basically save money on tech”, but also because they are “very sustainability-oriented”. “E-waste is a big topic; it’s something that matters to people.” Back Market – now a certified B Corp, which guarantees certain ethical standards – was founded in 2014 by Hug de Larauze and two friends, Quentin Le Brouster and Vianney Vaute. He says the launch was inspired by working with refurbishment specialists who were selling their wares on the likes of eBay. Hug de Larauze felt refurbished products needed a higher profile and smoother sales experience to give shoppers more confidence. They may be cheaper and greener, but refurbished items are up against expensively marketed household brands and “there was a big trust gap between those two worlds that needed to be filled”. Having started selling smartphones only in France, Back Market now sells 200 different types of refurbished gadget – from smartphones and laptops to baby monitors and gaming consoles – in 18 countries. These include the US and much of Europe as well as Japan, South Korea and Australia, with 4.5 million new customers last year taking the total to more than 13 million since launch. Back Market does not acquire or hold stock, or carry out refurbishment itself. It works with 1,700 traders and refurbishers who are rigorously screened before they are allowed to list. Sellers get their products from a mix of sources, including telecoms companies that offer trade-ins and upgrades to clients. Last year, after several rounds of funding, with money to fuel growth pumped in by the likes of Goldman Sachs and the Airbnb and Spotify investor Aglaé Ventures, Back Market decided to shift focus to making a profit. It is now funding itself, after interest rate rises and a weak IPO market meant sources of new cash became less promising. While a flotation is not completely ruled out, Hug de Larauze says new cash is not needed to continue expansion. He is confident the group is on a trajectory to book a profit in December. It has pulled back on hiring and has paused entering new territories or product categories to make the most of its established position. Back Market’s growth comes not only from its existing markets, but also from new services such as trade-in on certain products in the UK, France, US and other markets, and recycling, which is being tested in France. Hug de Larauze says he wants to offer the public a method of getting rid of unwanted tech in an easy, and potentially profitable, way rather than letting gadgets build up in a drawer. Buying back or offering to recycle items also provides a steady stream of products for Back Market’s army of refurbishers. With households in the UK each now hoarding an estimated 30 broken tech items – up from 20 four years ago, according to Material Focus – there is clearly lots of scope for such services. Further change is being driven by “right to repair” legislation, which will come into law across the EU member states by 2026, forcing manufacturers to make spare parts and technical information available for phones and tablet computers as well as kitchen appliances. In the UK, where we dispose of 2m tonnes of electronic waste every year, right to repair legislation was introduced in 2021. However, it only covers a handful of items including large kitchen appliances and TVs. Hug de Larauze wants legislation to go further: “If you really want to transition people to circularity and/or repair, making devices last longer, you need to involve everything. It takes a village and it takes, especially, manufacturers. It could include designing the products [with repair or longevity in mind], starting to sell the spare parts, or enabling people to fix stuff more easily.” Further legislation, under which electronics producers and retailers are being asked to pay more towards the collection and recycling of the items they sell, is also welcomed. However, the Back Market boss says the UK’s system needs tweaking so that repair is considered as the first option before recycling. “People would love to be able to purchase those products,” he says. “It should be a right for everyone to be able to fix the product that they have and to use it longer.” CV Age 36 Family Married with three daughters.

        "title": "Rail firm FirstGroup plans to expand cut-price Lumo services",
        "content": "The British transport operator FirstGroup has applied for two more “open access” services outside the main train operating contracts as the government attempts to increase competition on the rail network and cut fares. Open access means the operator takes full commercial risk, running services on infrastructure owned by a third party, on a chosen route that is not subject to a rail franchise set by the Department for Transport. FirstGroup began running an open access service through its Lumo business between London and Edinburgh in October 2021, which has carried more than 2.5 million passengers so far. It says train cancellations are among the lowest in the industry. Encouraged by the success of Lumo, FirstGroup said it had recently submitted applications to the Office of Rail and Road for a new Hull Trains service between London and Sheffield, which could start in 2026, and a new Lumo service between Rochdale and London, which could begin in 2027. It has also applied for the extension of a number of Lumo’s daily services to and from Glasgow; for an additional, eighth return service on Hull Trains between London and Hull and for an extra sixth return Lumo service between London and Newcastle. If successful, these services will more than double its open access capacity over the next three to five years. Graham Sutherland, the FirstGroup chief executive, said the new services, designed to bring cheaper fares to under-served UK destinations, would “bring people on to rail that might have gone for other transport options” such as by car or air. Open access routes account for just 0.3% of all rail network traffic in the UK. Lumo fares start from £19.90 if booked 12 weeks in advance and average £40 for a single ticket from London to Edinburgh, Sutherland said. This compares with single fares of about £50 on LNER for advance bookings. Other players include Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, which wants to make a comeback on the west coast mainline it used to run on an open access basis. FirstGroup, one of the UK’s biggest rail operators with more than 770,000 passenger journeys daily last year, said its open access operations had continued to perform better than expected in the year to 30 March. It has “consistently recorded some of the lowest levels of operator-related cancellations in the industry”, the company said. Lumo increased revenues by 42% year on year, with 75% of seats full, up from 71% the year before. At Hull Trains, revenues rose 40% last year thanks to increased leisure demand and significantly higher numbers of business passengers. In response, the company has added 14% more capacity since December 2022, running trains with 10 carriages rather than five at peak times. Seats were 69% full, up from 59% the year before. FirstGroup reported an overall adjusted pre-tax profit of £136.8m for last year, up from £97.9m the previous year. It is monitoring the European rail network for open access opportunities. “What you’re seeing in Europe is not dissimilar to UK open access,” said Sutherland. “The areas that move fastest are Italy, Spain and France. But our priority is the UK.” Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said this strengthened the case for public ownership. She added: “FirstGroup is extracting colossal profits from our bus and rail networks at the expense of passengers and workers. It makes no sense to pour billions of pounds into subsidising public transport and then allow third-party operators to profiteer from them by running down jobs and services.” Sutherland said the bulk of the profits were reinvested in infrastructure and assets, and highlighted the company’s average increase in wages across bus and rail of 8% over the past 12 months. The government has encouraged applications for more open access rail services to increase competition with the leading line operators. However, rail industry leaders see them as inefficient, while the RMT union has described the new model as “parasitic”. Labour’s plan for a “pragmatic” renationalisation of the railways matches the Conservatives’ policy on open access train providers. Labour’s policy document said open access “will remain where it adds value and capacity to the rail network”. A number of routes are in the pipeline, including a direct London-Wrexham rail service unveiled in March, as well as trains running from the capital straight to Stirling in Scotland, a service planned by the open access operator Grand Union, which was set up by the former British Rail executive Ian Yeowart.",

        "title": "Beefeater owner threatened with legal action over plan for 1,500 job cuts ",
        "content": "Hundreds of workers from restaurants including Brewers Fayre, Table Table and Beefeater outlets are threatening their parent company Whitbread with legal action over alleged poor consultation on 1,500 planned job cuts and closures. The Unite union has written to Whitbread, which also owns Premier Inn hotels, saying it is considering launching employment tribunal claims for unfair dismissal. It says some of the 3,000 workers potentially affected by the company’s moves to exit more than 200 restaurants have yet to be told which sites will close despite evidence that plans have been in place since December last year. The union, which is not formally recognised by Whitbread but says it represents hundreds of the people who may lose their jobs, claims that a statutory 45-day consultation with those affected, which kicked off in late April, has not been conducted in a “genuine or meaningful way”. It says there is no evidence that Whitbread has considered alternatives to redundancy despite the company reporting a 36% rise in underlying profit to £561m. Several workers who live in accommodation linked to their job have been told they will be served with eviction notices in July and August, which is when the bulk of redundancies are expected to be implemented. Whitbread, which runs 850 hotels in the UK, announced the plans for job cuts at the end of April as part of a £150m three-year cost-cutting drive. It said at the time it would seek to find alternative jobs for those affected. The company is looking to sell 126 unprofitable restaurants and close 112 more which will be converted into space for new hotel rooms. It will keep 196 mainly larger restaurants adjacent to hotels. Bryan Simpson, the lead organiser for the hospitality sector at Unite, said questions from the union and from elected representatives for those staff potentially affected by redundancy have not been answered. “The way in which our members have been treated by Whitbread is morally reprehensible and potentially unlawful,” he said. “We firmly believe that senior management have known about these redundancies for several months before their workers found out via the media and many don’t even know. “Despite refusing to answer questions from their workers and their union, the company now wishes to bulldoze through a consultation process which has been neither genuine nor meaningful, with the first terminations happening on 4 July.” A spokesperson for Whitbread, which has said the restaurants it is closing are loss-making and its profit rise comes from its hotels business, said: “We do not accept these allegations. We have a comprehensive and transparent collective consultation process, and are engaging directly with elected representatives and the individuals potentially affected. “The consultation process is still ongoing and as part of this we are seeking to find alternative opportunities wherever possible through the roles created by this programme and our existing recruitment process that makes circa 15,000 hires each year. We expect to retain a significant proportion of those who wish to remain with us and are providing dedicated support to our teams.” The company added that potentially affected individuals were informed about the status of their sites on 30 April and elected representatives had subsequently been provided with information about all site closures. Unite claims that staff from the restaurants have been offered a less generous payoff than workers in Whitbread’s head office or regional managers in relation to their position. For example, Simpson says that head office workers can receive a redundancy payment after one year of service compared with the statutory two years required for those serving in the restaurants. It said: “As the union for Whitbread workers, we will be doing everything we can legally, industrially and politically to challenge these unnecessary job losses – and win maximum compensation for our members.”",

        "title": "UK unemployment is up, but wage rises make early interest rate cut less likely",
        "content": "Private sector employers have cancelled job adverts and shed workers at a steady rate over the last year. According to the latest labour market data covering the three months to the end of April, the number of workers in the manufacturing sector was down from the same month last year. Likewise, retail sector employers have cut jobs, along with the hospitality sector. Perhaps surprisingly, given all the cyber-attacks on UK organisations and the demand for digital workers, the number of IT workers was lower in April than a year ago. Without an increase in the number of people employed across the health service and in education and public administration, the unemployment rate would have jumped by even more than it did. Across all sectors, the number of people unemployed rose by 138,000, taking the total to a little more than 1.5 million and lifting the unemployment rate to 4.4% from 4.3% in March. The data also shows that companies are cutting back on hiring, with the number of vacancies in March to May 2024 falling by 12,000 to 904,000. For the political parties campaigning in the general election, this data shows on the one hand that Rishi Sunak’s administration has put money into prominent areas of the public sector to increase staffing levels. There were 170,000 more health and social care workers in April than a year ago and 70,000 more people working in the education sector. On the other hand, almost every private sector industry cut back on the size of its workforce, indicating that businesses are looking, in some cases, to survive a period of slow growth, while others reduce staff to be more productive and improve their margins. The worst-affected private sector industry was hospitality and hotels, which the Office for National Statistics said has shed almost 80,000 workers in the last year. It is not hard to see why hotel managers would be hoping to be more efficient with the way they employ staff. The sector was at the top of the pay table in April, adding almost 10% to staff wages since last year. While most of this rise can be attributed to the increase in the minimum wage, it illustrates the pressure on businesses when forecasts for the economy show growth staying below 1% this year and not much above that figure next year. The Bank of England will be concerned that wages are still rising at an average level of about 6%. While most analysts expect that figures to slide during the rest of the year as the minimum wage rise begin to have less effect, central bank policymakers will want to delay the first interest rate cut since 2020 until they begin to see it happen. One thing the bank cannot know is how many businesses that pay above the minimum level will need to follow suit. The supermarkets have all increased pay at rates above inflation to stop workers defecting to industries that are catching up in the salary race. If this trend becomes widespread, if only temporary, there will be no cut in the cost of borrowing until August at the earliest, and possibly not until November.",

        "content": "The California genetic testing company 23andMe faces investigations by the data watchdogs of the UK and Canada over a security breach affecting nearly 7 million people last October. Hackers who broke into the site gained access to personal information by using customers’ old passwords. In some cases the information accessed included family trees, birth years and geographic locations. The San Francisco-based company analyses its customers’ DNA through a saliva sample to provide insights into health and ancestry, and has sold more than 12m DNA testing kits since it was set up in 2006, according to its website. The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) have launched a joint investigation into the data breach, the ICO said. It will examine the scope of information that was exposed by the breach and potential harms to affected people; whether 23andMe had adequate safeguards to protect the highly sensitive information within its control; and whether the company provided adequate notification about the breach to the two regulators and affected people, as required under Canadian and UK data protection laws. “We intend to cooperate with these regulators’ reasonable requests,” 23andMe said in a statement. A 23andMe spokesperson previously told the Guardian that the company did not “detect a breach” within 23andMe systems and instead attributed the incident to compromised recycled login credentials from certain users. Hackers initially accessed the personal data of 0.1% of customers – or about 14,000 individuals, which enabled them to access other people’s information because of an opt-in feature that allows DNA-related relatives to contact each other, so the true number of people exposed was 6.9 million. This was just less than half of 23andMe’s 14 million reported customers. 23andMe sells DNA testing kits starting from £79 for an “ancestry service” – “learn more about who you are” – and £129 for a “health and ancestry service” – “better understand how genetics impact your health”. The UK information commissioner, John Edwards, and the privacy commissioner of Canada, Philippe Dufresne, will investigate the 23andMe breach jointly. Edwards said: “People need to trust that any organisation handling their most sensitive personal information has the appropriate security and safeguards in place. This data breach had an international impact, and we look forward to collaborating with our Canadian counterparts to ensure the personal information of people in the UK is protected.” Dufresne said: “In the wrong hands, an individual’s genetic information could be misused for surveillance or discrimination. Ensuring that personal information is adequately protected against attacks by malicious actors is an important focus for privacy authorities in Canada and around the world.”",

        "content": "ANZ became the first of the big four banks to push their prediction of a Reserve Bank interest rate cut into 2025, adding to signs mortgage relief may still be some way off. The bank now expects the first RBA cash rate reduction to come in February. Until Monday, the ANZ was in line with CBA, NAB and Westpac in forecasting that a cut would land this November. “The stronger-than-expected [March quarter inflation reading] makes it hard to see the RBA being sufficiently confident that inflation will return to and stay in the band by the time the November meeting comes around,” said Adam Boyton, ANZ’s head of Australian economics. The RBA board will meet early next week, with investors not expecting any change in the RBA’s 4.35% cash rate, that now sits at the highest since late 2011. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release May labour market figures on Thursday, giving the central bank a key data release to consider. CBA estimates the economy added 30,000 jobs last month, enough to keep the jobless rate at 4.1%. “Leading indicators of employment and the labour market more generally such as GDP growth, job ads and private sector surveys suggest conditions will continue to loosen this year,” CBA said. NAB’s monthly business survey, also released on Monday, found the “subdued economic activity” at the start of 2024 had extended into the current June quarter. Business confidence had turned negative and business conditions were just below the long-run average. Consumer-facing sectors such as retail and personal services were among the weakest both in terms of conditions and forward orders, NAB said. “Despite the softening in activity, capacity utilisation remains above average, which suggests the process of bringing supply and demand back into balance remains incomplete,” Alan Oster, NAB’s chief economist said. Oster said there were “reasons to be very wary about the inflation outlook”. The NAB survey found labour cost growth quickened to 2.3% in the past three months from 1.5% in April. Purchase costs and product prices also both increased at a faster pace. “We have been wary for some time that the path of inflation from here is likely to be gradual and uneven, and the survey results really reinforce this message,” he said. One bright spot in the business survey was an improvement in the employment index for the month, lifting it back above average. The labour market “remains a point of strength for the economy”, Oster said. Another bright spot has been car sales. In first five months of 2024, vehicles sales were up 12% from a year earlier to 512,753, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries said. Sales in May alone set a record for a second year in a row. In a separate release on Monday, the Council of Australian Financial Regulators said in its quarterly update that financial hardship applications and the portion of borrowers falling behind on mortgage payments continued to rise “but from a low level”. The council groups the Reserve Bank, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and federal treasury. The Australian Financial Security Authority told the council insolvencies for individuals and companies, particularly small and medium sized enterprises, had risen over the past year. “This followed a period where insolvencies had been well below usual levels reflecting the significant support measures put in place during the pandemic, including those from the ATO,” AFSA said.",

        "content": "One in three Asda staff have been attacked at work, according to research that included reports of workers being stabbed, punched and threatened with syringes. The poll of almost 1,000 members of GMB, one of the UK’s biggest unions, returned stories of delivery drivers being chased by people in cars, while store workers had food thrown at them. More than half (58%) of respondents said they had suffered injury or illness on the job. Workers told how they had been spat at, suffered broken bones, been hit with bottles, and had death threats against them and their children. Delivery drivers said they had been confronted by customers in the nude, while store workers spoke of having had watermelons and joints of gammon thrown at them. The issue of attacks on shop workers in the UK has been growing, with reports in February of 1,300 incidents of violence and abuse a day and a battle to control “brazen” acts of shoplifting. In April a British Retail Consortium report found that instances of violence and abuse in shopping centres rose 65% from 2021-22 to 2022-23. Body armour suppliers say demand for stab vests to be worn by shopping centre security staff has soared in the past two years. Earlier that month the government announced plans to introduce tougher punishments for serial or abusive shoplifters in England and Wales under a new standalone criminal offence of assaulting a retail worker. The measure had been due to be appended to the criminal justice bill going through parliament this summer, but that was one of the measures dropped during last month’s “wash-up” – the period when pending legislation is swiftly pushed through before an election. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, promised at the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) annual conference in April to reverse what he called the Tory “shoplifter’s charter” – a rule that means theft of store goods worth less than £200 is not investigated – and the party’s manifesto on Thursday may include the pledge. In total, 339 people (35%) told the GMB survey they had experienced verbal or physical violence while doing their job. The poll will be discussed at GMB’s annual congress in Bournemouth on Tuesday. Nadine Houghton, a GMB national officer, said it was “horrifying” and that “no one should have to suffer this kind of abuse and violence at work”. She added: “But this situation is only going to get worse as staff hours are slashed, leaving less people in store and those who are there more vulnerable.” A spokesperson for Asda said: “Unfortunately, like all retailers, we have seen an increase of violence and aggression towards our colleagues during the last few years. The safety of our colleagues is a primary concern, which is why we have invested over £30m during the last three years to upgrade the CCTV systems in stores. “We work with all of our colleague representatives in the important area of colleague security and also back calls for violence or abuse against retail workers to be made a standalone criminal offence in all parts of the UK, and hope this is a priority for any incoming government.”",

        "title": "South West Water owner’s boss should lose all bonuses after Devon parasite outbreak | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "Here’s a rarity: a chief executive turning down an annual bonus two years in a row out of solidarity with the suffering customers. But when the company is Pennon Group, owner of South West Water, the operation currently knee-deep in a diarrhoea and vomiting outbreak in Devon caused by polluted water, Susan Davy had little real choice. She cannot expect applause for leading “from the front” and “living our values”, as she described her decision to turn down £237,000 in cash. In fact, the question is why she still thought it appropriate to collect £298,000 under her separate long-term share-based scheme. That award sent her overall pay up from £543,000 to £860,000, a figure that may cause stomach pain across the south-west, not just in the coastal town of Brixham, where the parasite cryptosporidium was found in the system. A year ago, she saw the short- and long-term schemes as a job lot and waived both. If anything, the case for surrendering both elements of variable pay should have been more compelling this time because an outbreak of illness is bad even by the standards of the modern water industry. There was no explanation of the different logic in the annual report. A deeper question is why the bonus issue even arose in the first place. Why wasn’t it automatically reduced to zero in current circumstances? The answer lies with the usual suspect – the fact the standard “balanced scorecard” of objectives for an executive includes so many elements that it is hard to miss them all. In Davy’s case, the formula spat out a ratio of 46.5% of maximum, which the remuneration committee cut to 38.5% after applying its “discretion framework in respect of South West Water’s environment and pollution performance”. Come on though, outsiders will still be baffled as to why the committee’s discretion could be so minor (and so precise). Even ignoring the parasite outbreak, South West Water is still falling substantially short on the Environment Agency’s most important annual measure: the company got two stars, when four is the aim, under the latest industry-wide environmental performance assessment. Nor is it the case that Pennon’s shareholders are having a better time. Yes, they got a £127m dividend even as the Devon outbreak was in full swing, but the share price has roughly halved during Davy’s four years as chief executive. Not for the first time, one must ask what is the point of these “balanced scorecards” if they produce unbalanced outcomes that miss the wider picture. In a month’s time, Ofwat, the sector’s economic regulator, will unveil its first view of the English and Welsh water suppliers’ business plans for the next five years, including the company-by-company increases in bills to fund greater investment. Bill rises are inevitable and South West Water is looking for 30%-ish, which may be at the lower end of the industry’s range but will still come as a shock to many customers. Davy should have read the room: if it was right to turn down short- and long-term awards last year, it was right to do so again. Half measures don’t cut it.",

        "content": "A Labour election victory will be a “net positive” for financial markets, strategists at the US bank JP Morgan have said, in an analysis that underlines the appeal of Keir Starmer’s “centrist platform” to the City of London. A majority for Labour would benefit banks, builders and supermarkets, analysts led by JP Morgan’s head of global equity strategy, Mislav Matejka, wrote in a note to clients published on Monday. The US investment bank said Labour’s policies would be “modestly pro-growth, but crucially with a likely cautious fiscal approach”. Analysts at MUFG, a Japanese investment bank, separately said that a landslide victory for Labour would be “most positive for the pound” because it would end political instability, raise expectations of higher government spending, and potentially help usher in a more constructive relationship between the UK and EU after Brexit. Starmer is firm favourite to become the next UK prime minister, according to polls. Labour’s turnaround since the 2019 general election has been marked – including in the ousting of former leader Jeremy Corbyn and the watering down of previous spending commitments. It has also included a concerted, years-long “smoked salmon offensive” by Labour to try to charm big business. “We believe the market impact will be net positive,” they wrote. “The current Labour party is occupying a centrist platform, and the perception of policy paralysis is set to move behind us. “Labour agenda is modestly pro-growth, but crucially with a likely cautious fiscal approach. Our economists believe that, given the lack of fiscal space, Labour will likely focus on supply-side reforms to help improve economic growth.” More than half of the 268 respondents to a Bloomberg News poll published on Monday of readers and users of its financial markets terminal said a Labour win would be the best result for the pound. Derek Halpenny and Lee Hardman at MUFG wrote last week that Labour’s spending plans were “unlikely to fuel investor concerns”. They wrote that the party is likely to learn the lesson of the Conservative party under Liz Truss, whose premiership rapidly spiralled into chaos after financial markets took fright at unfunded tax cuts. The pound fell under Truss to its lowest ever level against the US at $1.0327, compared with $1.27 on Monday. Labour has promised to stick to fiscal rules, including not borrowing to cover day-to-day government spending and cutting net public debt as a proportion of GDP over a five-year forecast period. Halpenny and Hardman wrote: “There’s nothing bold here, no shift in fiscal frameworks and Labour are essentially committing to the same fiscal constraints that are in place now.” Matthew Ryan, the head of market strategy at the financial services firm Ebury, wrote on Monday that the prospect of a Labour government was “actually buoying sterling” in comparison with the euro, which has been hit by uncertainty over how much power far-right parties will control after European elections and Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call a snap election in France. Broadly, the strategists at JP Morgan favour the domestically focused FTSE 250 share index of medium-sized companies listed in London over the blue-chip FTSE 100, which has more of an international focus. JP Morgan’s verdict on Starmer’s Labour stands in stark contrast to its dislike of Corbyn’s policies, including nationalisation of several industries. In 2019, JP Morgan said a Labour government “would weigh heavily” on the minds of foreign investors. Nevertheless, not all big business would welcome a Labour government in 2024, JP Morgan said, citing the promised nationalisation of the train network and proposals to increase taxes on energy companies. Water companies are also likely to face increased regulation, but other utilities could benefit from spending on net zero energy infrastructure. The pound hit a 22-month high against the euro on Monday as the single currency was hit by Emmanuel Macron’s surprise decision to call snap parliamentary elections in France. Sterling reached €1.1847, for the first time since August 2022. Macron’s shock move also hit stocks in Paris, where the CAC 40 index fell more than 2% at one stage, and closed down 1.35%. Germany’s Dax finished the day 0.35% lower, after German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition suffered losses in the EU elections. French bond prices also weakened, which widened the gap between Paris and Berlin’s borrowing costs. France’s 10-year bond yield (the interest rate on the bond) jumped to 3.23%, the highest since last November, up from 3.115% on Friday night.",

Here’s the full story: European financial markets have been rocked by yesteday’s election results, and President Emmanuel Macron’s surprise decision to call snap parliamentary elections in France. The pound hit a 22-month high against the euro on Monday, reaching €1.1839, for the first time since August 2022. Macron’s shock move also hit stocks in Paris, where the CAC 40 index fell over 2% at one stage. Germany’s DAX was is 0.7% in afternoon trading, after German chancellor Olaf Scholz suffered losses in the EU elections. French bond prices also weakened, which widened the gap between Paris and Berlin’s borrowing costs. France’s 10-year bond yield (the interest rate on the bond) jumped to 3.22%, the highest since last November, up from 3.115% on Friday night. And in other news… ABN AMRO Global Insight say there are three potential scenarios how the French elections could play out. Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party (RN) gains a majority at the parliament: This could lead to a so-called cohabitation for the remaining three years. This refers to a situation where the president’s political party and the Prime Minister’s party are different. In this scenario, the President would be forced to nominate a Prime Minister from the RN. This would clearly be the most risky scenario for the French debt market as it would negatively impact the country’s fiscal outlook. However, for this to happen the RN would need to substantially increase its number of seats as it currently holds 89 seats in the parliament against 245 seats for the government in place. In our view, it will be difficult for the RN party to be able to close the gap to this extent. Furthermore, the risk of seeing the far-right party leading the government might push traditional parties like the PS (left-wing party) or the LR (right-wing) party to form a coalition to keep the RN party out of the government. Reunification of the left-wing NUPES coalition which was established during the past election composed of the Socialist (PS), the Greens (Les Verts), and far-left party (La France Insoumise). Last time, the NUPES coalition managed to obtain 131 seats (second biggest political force in the parliament after Macron’s party). If this coalition were to gain a majority, then Macron would need to nominate a prime minister from this coalition instead. However, we deem this scenario unlikely given the recent political backlash between the socialist party (PS) and Melenchon’s party (La France Insoumise), particularly following the controversial reactions to the Gaza conflict from the LFI party. Therefore, there is significant uncertainty on whether a coalition could be formed again. The parties are currently in discussion on the possibility to re-form this coalition. An update on this should follow in the upcoming days. Last, we think there is still a significant chance for Macron’s party to retain its (relative) majority at the parliament. This scenario is in our view the most likely outcome at the moment, as despite the EU election results, this is usually not representative of the likely legislative election outcome. This would be the most market-friendly scenario as the current government would remain in place and continue with its economic and fiscal plan, which are more in line with the EU’s fiscal rules. However, it is likely that Macron’s party will lose seats compared to two years ago. Credit rating agency DBRS Morningstar has warned that the snap French legislative elections announced last night increase political uncertainty and present a risk to policy predictability. They point out that they could lead to a change of government just before Paris hosts the Olympics. There are also important fiscal events coming up, including 2024 new expenditure savings and 2025 budget preparation. Mehdi Fadli, senior vice president in the Global Sovereign Ratings Group, says: “In a strained geopolitical context, French snap elections bring heightened political uncertainty and the risk of less policy predictability to France. “Elections now coincide with a time of significant importance for France’s fiscal trajectory.” The State Bank of Pakistan has joined the growing roster of central banks cutting interest rates. Pakistan’s central bank has cut rates for the first time in four years today, and by more than expected, as it lowered its benchmark rate by 150 basis points (1.5 percentage points) to 20.50%, from 22%. The State Bank eased policy after Pakistan’s consumer inflation rate slowed to 11.8% in May, a 30-month low. It says: “The committee, on balance, viewed that it is now an appropriate time to reduce the policy rate.” Fast-fashion pureplay PrettyLittleThing (PLT) is facing a customer backlash after becoming the latest retailer to introduce a returns fee for customers. PLT is now charging £1.99 to return items in the UK, having previously offered free returns via couriers including Evri, Royal Mail and InPost. The BBC reports that some shoppers have posted screenshots on social media showing their PLT apps being deleted from their phones, with many saying they would return fewer items if the brand’s sizing was more consistent. More here. PLT is hardly the first retailer to drop free returns, though. Two years ago its parent company, Boohoo, began charging shoppers to return unwanted items. Although next month’s UK election could boost asset prices, it also creates economic uncertainty that could dent confidence. The 4 July poll is also likely to deter the Bank of England from lowering interest rates at its meeting later this month, explains Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK: The general election won’t derail economic outlook, but there is a chance that the uncertainty means confidence takes a temporary hit. When you combine this with sticky service inflation, then it is very unlikely that we will get an interest cut before August. With markets pricing in just a 5% chance of a rate cut in June, the MPC has a good excuse to hold off until August, when we think the first cut will come. As economic headwinds continue to ease, the MPC will start to feel the heat this summer to make the first move Elsewhere today, the average shelf life of a UK mortgage has nearly halved in the space of a month. At the start of June, the typical mortgage was spending 15 days on the market before being pulled from sale, down from an average of 28 days at the start of May, according to data provider Moneyfacts. June’s reading is the shortest average time period recorded since March, with offers being pulled as lenders reviewed their ranges, repricing some offers and withdrawing others. Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts, says: “Consumers concerned about rising rates would be wise to seek advice from an independent broker to see if they can lock into a deal early, as some will let borrowers do this from three to six months in advance. However, there may well be some borrowers sitting on the fence, hoping the market gets a base rate cut this year, but they could still grab a lower rate deal than if they were to sit on their SVR without fixing, such as with a tracker deal. Those about to come off a five-year fixed mortgage will have to face the reality that rates are much higher now on an equivalent deal, 2.65% in fact, compared to June 2019, so consumers must ensure they can afford the higher repayments.” The pound’s rally to a 22-month high against the euro this morning will be a boost to UK holidaymakers visiting the continent this summer (once they’ve got through the queues…). At €1.1823 this morning, sterling is up 2.5% so far this year against the euro, meaning pound will go a little further at European gift shops, bars and restaurants. It’s 6% stronger than in the aftermath of the 2022 mini-budget, when the pound fell and was only worth €1.11. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, says: “The prospect for an overwhelming Labour victory at the General Election next month is actually buoying Sterling, which has broken out of its year long range against the euro. Markets view a Labour majority as perhaps the most market-friendly outcome of the elections – a reflection of both the lingering damage done by Liz Truss’s ill-fated budget, a shift towards the political centre under Keir Starmer and the likelihood of a less contentious relationship with the European Union. There are three tactical reasons why Emmanual Macron plumped for shock parliamentary elections after learning his centrist alliance had lagged far behind the far-right National Rally (RN) in the European parliamentary elections, says Philippe Ledent, senior economist at ING. On the one hand, the short campaign ahead will force the other parties to clarify their positions. Remember that in the current parliament, no political group has a majority (neither the president’s party, the traditional parties, nor the RN). Until now, it has almost always been impossible to form stable coalitions on important reforms, forcing the government to go by force (using article 49.3 of the constitution, allowing it to pass laws without a vote in parliament unless parliament passes a no-confidence motion). The threat of a major RN parliamentary victory could move positions. The president probably also wants to show that the vote in the European elections was a protest vote, giving the image of a stronger RN than is actually the case. Let’s not forget that, contrary to the European ones, the legislative elections are held in two rounds and abstention reached over 48.5% during yesterday’s vote. No doubt President Macron is counting on voter mobilisation and alliances between the two rounds to overturn yesterday’s results. Assuming, however, that the RN manages to win an absolute majority (which would require it to win over 200 seats compared with its current representation), President Macron would be forced to co-habit with a government drawn from the RN. If anything, history has shown that this works against the governing party. As for the RN, unaccustomed to power, perhaps the president wants to demonstrate that the RN is not the solution, though this remains a gamble. The European election results aren’t the only factor weighing on markets today. Investors are also anxious that the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, may not cut US interest rates as soon as hoped. Early rate cuts look extremely unlikely after America’s economy added 272,000 new jobs last month, much more than expected. Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index, explains: The DAX is falling but is holding up better than some of its European peers, such as the French CaC, as investors digest the results from European parliamentary elections. Eurosceptic far-right parties performed well, and Chancellor Scholz’s Social Democrats fell to third place behind the far-right Alternative for Germany. Meanwhile, in France, President Emmanuel Macron surprised the markets by calling for snap elections after Marine Le Pen’s hard-right National Rally party won more than 30% of the votes. French banks were bearing the brunt of the news, with BNP and Société Générale among the largest decliners. Stocks suffered a double blow as election worries combined with concerns that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates anytime soon. The hotter the following stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday has seen the market rein in Federal Reserve rate cut expectations. Meanwhile, in Europe, the ECB cut interest rates last week but refused to commit to further rate cuts and upwardly revised its inflation forecasts. Over the weekend, ECB President Robert Holzman voiced caution on further rate cuts. The head of the Austrian central bank said the bank would be looking to avoid putting itself in a corner and did not want to comment on the future path for rate cuts. And here’s why JP Morgan thinks housebuilders would benefit from a Labour government: Both parties look to focus on increasing the supply of affordable housing. Labour in particular have advocated for the reintroduction of the target to build 300,000 homes a year. They intend to cut red tape to expedite the approval process. for new-builds (including reform to “Not in my backyard” policy). This would be a positive for home builders, especially the ones geared towards the lower end of the housing market. Labour has also undertaken to extend the current mortgage guarantee scheme which helps homebuyers accessmortgages with low deposits. JP Morgan also suggest that an environment of greater political and policy stability after the election could help stabilize the outflows from UK assets. They point out that British shares have lagged global rivals since the Brexit vote, saying: UK equities currently trade at a 38% discount versus MSCI World, much larger than typical historically. On the eve of the Brexit referendum in June 2016 they traded at par with the World. And on the winners and losers of a Labour election victory, they explains: At sector level, we see a Labour win as a positive outcome for Banks, Homebuilders and Food Retail, while Energy and Transportation are likely to trade negatively as a result of Labour’s policies. The Utility sector is likely to benefit from the increased spending in “clean” technologies as Labour works towards achieving its net-zero target; however, Water sector could be at risk of increased regulation. JP Morgan’s research report shows that since 1970 the UK stock market has rallied by 1%, on average, in the month after a Conservative election win, but dipped by 2% in the month after Labour has triumphed. They say: Historically, short term market reaction to a Labour victory in UK elections has been somewhat weaker than for Conservatives. However, we think that this time a Labour win will likely be seen as a positive for the UK markets. The current Labour party has a much more centrist policy agenda. [interestingly, though, UK markets have fallen by 5% on average after six months of a Conservative government, but gained 8% after half a year of a Labour government]. After a couple of hours trading in Europe, here’s a recap of the main moves. The Paris stock market has dropped deeply into the red, after Emmanual Macron stunned France by calling snap parliamentary elections last night. The CAC 40 is down 2% right now, a three-month low, with bank stocks falling over 4%. Macron called the snap poll after his centrist alliance was trounced by Marine Le Pen’s far-right movement in the European parliamentary vote. Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo, market analyst at xs.com, explains why investors are concerned: Macron’s decision to call for early elections adds a new layer of uncertainty in France, a crucial country within the eurozone. If Marine Le Pen’s far-right party wins a parliamentary majority, Macron’s ability to govern and manage national affairs could be seriously constrained. This prospect is causing significant concern among investors, as prolonged instability in the eurozone’s second-largest economy could have considerable repercussions in financial markets. The euro has dropped to its lowest level since August 2022 against the pound, which rose to €1.1829 this morning. The euro also dropped to a one-month low against the US dollar. Charalampos Pissouros, senior investment analyst at XM, says: Although socialist, liberal and center parties are set to retain a majority in the European Parliament, the surge in Eurosceptic nationalists is likely to make it more difficult for lawmakers to agree and push through reforms and policies that give the Union more power. Combined with the prospect of a far-right victory in France, this could keep the euro pressured for a while longer. European stock markets have been roiled too, with Germany’s DAX down 0.9% and Italy’s FTSE MIB losing 0.95%. In the bond market, the ‘spread’ between the borrowing costs of Germany, and of France and Italy, has widened – a sign that investors are more nervous about the implications of Sunday’s election results. Bill Blain, market strategist at Wind Shift Capital, said today: There is nothing like the prospect of increasing European political instability, rising distrust of the EU and its agencies (including the ECB), and internal dissent to rile bond markets thinking about European Sovereign Bond markets. The concept of a united monetary and fiscal union in Europe moves further away. The UK election is also on the City’s mind, with JP Morgan saying a Labour win would be good for markets….and a Bloomberg poll finding it would support the pound. Here’s Moody’s Ratings analyst Ruosha Li on the impact of the European elections: “A thinner margin for defections from the centrist coalition could make it harder to get a new commission confirmed and some legislation across the line over the next five years. But parliament is unlikely to impede progress on key priorities like security and competitiveness, including a capital markets union.” The selloff in French government bond selloff is continuing, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on France’s 10-year bonds. Political shock following Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call snap parliamentary elections has pushed up 10-year French government bond yields to around 3.2%, from 3.115% on Friday night. That’s the highest since last November. Lizzy Galbraith, political economist at abrdn, says: “Following poor European parliamentary elections, in which his Renaissance party secured 15.2% of the vote, well behind Marine le Pen’s Rassemblement National (RN) which won 31.5%, French President Macron has announced snap parliamentary elections on 30 June and 7 July. Palriamentary elections will not affect Macron’s position as president, but leave him vulnerable to having to govern with opposition parties in control of parliament, further entrenching the difficulties he has had in passing legislation under his current term. Macron will hope to use any concerns among French voters about the strength of RN to unify opposition votes and strengthen his voter base, but with his personal popularity low, he faces an uphill battle. Unlike the proportional system used in the European parliamentary elections, French parliamentary elections use first past the post, so while RN appears on course for major gains, they may not be as substantial as this weekend’s result suggests.” Analysts at JP Morgan say a Labour win in the UK general election would be a positive development for the financial markets. In an Equity Strategy note published this morning, they explain that Labour is “occupying a centrist platform”, saying: Labour agenda is modestly pro-growth, but crucially with a likely cautious fiscal approach. Our economists believe that, given the lack of fiscal space, Labour will likely focus on supply-side reforms to help improve economic growth. Labour have also sought to reassure businesses by ruling out corporation tax increases. In terms of key policies, Labour’s Green Prosperity Plan will focus on the country’s climate transition, while both parties are focused on affordable housing. Broadly, they favour the domestically focused FTSE 250 share index, of medium-sized companies listed in London, over the blue-chip FTSE 100 which has more of an international focus. JP Morgan predict that the banking sector, housebuilders and food retailers would benefit. They explain: Banks: political and policy stability from a Labour party win would be supportive for the sector, particularly absent any risks around Corporation tax/Banking surcharge, as was the case during the 2019 elections; Homebuilders: housing will likely be core to the upcoming elections, with the focus on affordable housing, unlocking land for development and reforming the planning system; and Food Retail: Labour party support for policies like incentivizing private sector investment and continued focus on cost of living crisis. But, JP Morgan adds that a Labour party win would be less positive for Transportation, as “nationalisation of the railways would weigh on the sector”; Energy, as Labour plan to increase and extend the Energy Profits Levy. The big issue for investors to think about today are the consequences and implications of the far right’s gains across Europe at the EU elections, says Bill Blain, market strategist at Wind Shift Capital. There is nothing like the prospect of increasing European political instability, rising distrust of the EU and its agencies (including the ECB), and internal dissent to rile bond markets thinking about European Sovereign Bond markets. The concept of a united monetary and fiscal union in Europe moves further away. Over three-quarters of UK stocks are in the red this morning. The FTSE 100 share index has dipped by 27 points, or 0.33%, to its lowest level since the end of May. About 78 of the blue-chip companies on the index are lower, led by gambling firm Entain (-2.2%), packaging group DS Smith (-1.9%) and banks NatWest (-1.8%) and Lloyds (-1.8%). AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says: “Political turmoil in Europe saw the FTSE 100 start the week on the back foot with only a handful of names on the index trading in positive territory. “An unexpectedly strong showing for far-right parties in European elections in France prompted President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap parliamentary election to be held within the next 30 days. This injects a big dose of the uncertainty which markets hate – with the euro dropping sharply in response to the developments. “Financial stocks were among the worst performers in London as investors digested the news. Also affecting sentiment were Friday’s better-than-expected US jobs numbers which push back against the narrative that rate cuts are imminent. The euro continues to bob around a one-month low this morning, at $1.0763 against the US dollar: French banks are being hit by the political uncertainty created by Emmanuel Macron’s snap election. Société Générale shares have slumped by 5.4%, while BNP Paribas has lost 4.4% and Credit Agricole is down 4.1%. That’s helped to knock the French CAC 40 share index to its lowest since late February this morning. The snap election called in France has added to the “uncertain tides swirling around financial markets, says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, adding: Investors are assessing Macron’s gamble in attempting to reassert his authority after voters shifted en masse to the Far-right during the EU elections, in both France and Germany. The euro has dropped sharply against the dollar, to $1.074, the lowest in a month amid the surprise turn of events. Analysts at Deutsche Bank say Sunday’s EU elections will ‘shift the direction of travel’ for European policy over the next five years” Here’s their take: The two main take-aways of the election results are (1) the centrist majority in the European parliament is holding as the far-right did not outperform and (2) the biggest impact could be at the national level with Macron calling a legislative election. As implied by opinion polls, centrist parties managed to secure a majority in the European parliament. While the far-right saw gains, fears of a populist shock at the EU level seem to have been premature. This is all the more the case, as right-wing parties are not a coherent bloc. Nevertheless, while the elections did not bring a seismic shock to EU-level politics, they are still likely to shift the direction of travel for policy over the next five years. The biggest impact of the election result could be at a national level with President Macron announcing the dissolution of the French parliament after the defeat of his Renaissance party. Snap elections are called for June 30. Domestic government stability in other major eurozone economies is unlikely to be affected by the elections (despite the electoral defeat of Scholz’s SPD). The gap between Germany’s borrowing costs and other eurozone members is widening this morning, a sign that Sunday’s EU election results have rattled investors. The difference between the yield (or interest rate) on German and French government bonds has widened, after Emmanuel Macron called new parliamentary elections last night. That’s because the price of French government debt has weakened, pushing up the yield on 10-year OATs to 3.18%, an increase of 6 basis points, from 3.12% on Friday night. German bunds, which are a classic safe-haven asset, are little changed; their yield is only up 2 basis points to 2.64%. The spread between Italian and German yields has widened 7 bps to 138 bps. Reuters points out that the gains made by Eurosceptic nationalists in the European Parliamentary elections may complicate EU policymaking and attempts to deepen integration over the next five years. German’s DAX share index has also opened in the red, falling about 0.7%. Ouch. Paris’s stock market has dropped sharply in early trading, after Emmanual Macron stunned France by calling a snap election. The CAC 40 index, of the largest stocks in Paris, has fallen by over 2% to a three-month low. That would be its biggest one-day drop since last November. The euro’s weakness today has sent it to its lowest level against sterling since August 2022. The pound traded as high as €1.1829 this morning, up half a euro cent, a level last seen shortly before Liz Truss’s mini-budget sent sterling reeling: The euro has weakened in recent months as it became clear that interest rates would be cut faster in the eurozone than in other advanced economies. Last week the ECB lowered interest rates for the first time in five years, while the Bank of England is not expected to cut rates until November. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, agrees that a Labour majority would be the most “market friendly” outcome for the UK election. Ryan explained: “Indeed, the pound continues to comfortably outperform the euro in the past month, as markets view a Labour majority as perhaps the most market-friendly outcome of the pending general election – a reflection of both the lingering damage done by Liz Truss’s ill-fated budget, and a shift towards the political centre under Keir Starmer’s leadership. The latest polling continues to give Labour a solid lead: With less than a month to the UK general election, City investors are weighing up the implications of a new government. And a poll conducted by Bloomberg has found that a Labour victory in next month’s UK election would be the best outcome for the pound, while a hung Parliament was seen as the worst result. That’s a verdict that will cheer Labour, as it tries to persuade voters that it is a safe choice on 4 July. As Derek Halpenny, head of research for Europe, Africa and the Middle East at MUFG, put it: “A large stable majority for the Labour Party, which is less divided than the Tories, will signal better stability ahead.” Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has put a lot of effort into reassuring the City they can trust her party, arguing that Labour is the “natural party of British business”, and ruling out raising income tax, national insurance and VAT. Less encouragingly, about 60% of those polled – which included portfolio managers, economists and retail investors – reckon it will take the pound more than five years to return to the $1.50 level it traded at before the EU referendum of 2016. More here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The euro is under pressure today as traders digest last night’s EU election results, and a shock parliamentary election being called in France. Political uncertainty has knocked the single currency to a one-month low; it’s down half a cent this morning to $1.0753. Against the pound, the euro has dropped to a near two-year low. European stock markets are set to open in the red, too. The euro lost ground after France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, announced he will dissolve parliament and call snap legislative elections after his allies suffered a crushing defeat to Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN) in Sunday’s European parliament elections. It was also a bad election for German chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose Social Democrats scored their worst result ever while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) secured second place. Macron took his shock move after his centrist list, headed by MEP Valérie Hayer, scored just 15% in the European poll, less than half the 31.5% tally booked by RN, whose lead candidate was the party’s president, Jordan Bardella. Analysts say it’s unprededented in modern French politics for a president to call an early parliamentary election from a position of weakness. Macron, who still has three years of his presidential term to serve, may want to put RN under more scrutiny, and present French voters with a clear choice – either a pro-European, pro-Ukraine, centrist position, or the far right alternative. Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, explains: Only just over half of French voters turned out on Sunday, compared to 70% in national elections. No party which has “won” a European election in France has gone on to win the following national. election. All attempts by Macron’s camp to make the campaign a referendum on the Ukraine war or the. survival of the European Union or on the competence and extremist background of Le Pen and her chief allies, fell on deaf ears. The campaign was from the beginning a referendum on Macron’s seven years in power—and turned especially on “far right” themes such as immigration and violence. Although right-wing parties made significant gains across Europe, Commission president Ursula von der Leyen was able to declare that “the centre is holding”, with candidates from her centre-right European People’s party securing the most seats. But mainstream parties did lose seats overall, which will complicate von der Leyen’s bid for a a second five-year term at the helm of the EU commission.",

        "title": "BP staff risk sack if they fail to disclose intimate relationships with colleagues",
        "content": "BP employees will have to disclose intimate relationships with colleagues or risk losing their jobs, according to a new policy brought out after the dismissal of former boss Bernard Looney for failing to tell the board. Employees must disclose “familial and intimate relationships at work” without exception, the FTSE 100 oil company said on Monday. That is a tougher stance than before, when they only had to disclose relationships if they thought there was a a conflict of interest risk. The top 4,500 managers, out of a workforce of 90,000, have three months to report all of the intimate relationships they have had in the past three years. Looney left the company in September after failing to disclose relationships with colleagues to the board, which was investigating after a tipoff from a whistleblower. The company later formally dismissed Looney, saying that the failure to disclose amounted to “serious misconduct”. BP said it had made the change, which was first reported by Reuters, after a review of its conflicts of interest policy. The policy applies to all employees, the company added. BP said: “The policy requires conflicts of interest to be disclosed, recorded and – where appropriate – mitigated. Familial and intimate relationships at work can constitute a conflict of interest. “Employees were previously required to disclose and record such relationships if they felt there could be a conflict of interest. Now they are required to disclose intimate relationships at work, whether or not they feel they represent a conflict of interest. “As a policy that forms part of BP’s code of conduct, non-compliance with the policy could result in disciplinary action.” The emphasis on senior leaders having to disclose past relationships reflects the influence they have, BP said. In Looney’s case, BP investigated claims about him in 2022, but received assurances from the then chief executive about his conduct. However, he shocked City investors the following September with an abrupt resignation less than four years into his tenure. Murray Auchincloss replaced Looney. Auchincloss’s partner also works for BP, but the company has said that this was disclosed when he was promoted to chief financial officer. Looney’s failure to report his relationships proved costly: BP denied him more than £32m in pay and share awards for knowingly misleading the board. About £25m of that sum related to share awards.",

        "content": "The boss of South West Water’s owner has received a pay increase of £300,000, weeks after an outbreak of diarrhoea caused by a parasite in Devon’s water supply. Susan Davy, the chief executive of Pennon Group, was awarded £860,000 in total pay for the latest financial year, up from £543,000 the year before, according to accounts published on Monday. The increase came despite Pennon executives agreeing to forgo bonuses for this year in recognition of the widespread outrage over sewage dumping. Britain’s water companies have been under intense scrutiny in recent years over their environmental performance, amid disgust over the amount of raw sewage flowing into the UK’s rivers and seas. Those concerns have been particularly relevant for customers of South West Water in Devon, after the outbreak last month of the parasite cryptosporidium, which causes cryptosporidiosis, often in the form of diarrhoea and vomiting. The parasite spreads from faeces. South West Water customers near the seaside town of Brixham were advised to boil their tap water before drinking it. About 17,000 households were affected by the warning, with compensation of up to £265 for those still affected as of 7 June. News of Davy’s pay increase comes amid a general election campaign in which water quality has played a prominent role. Anthony Mangnall, who was the Conservative MP for Totnes and South Devon until the dissolution of parliament, said Davy should resign after refusing to change course on a £127m dividend. The dividend was decided last month despite the company making a £9.1m loss for the year. “Once again South West Water have put themselves before the people,” he said. “From paying out dividends to increasing their own pay, this only goes to show that they are a company deeply out of touch with the needs and wants of the people.” Davy’s pay rise came as she received £298,000 under a long-term incentive plan awarded in 2021, before the company had brought in changes to lower share awards if water quality was not up to scratch. That came on top of fixed pay worth £562,000. Pennon executives did give up part of their variable pay for the year, meaning Davy’s pay was £237,000 lower than it otherwise might have been. In a foreword to the annual report, Davy wrote: “As CEO, it’s also my job to lead from the front and champion living our values. With executive remuneration continuing to be in the media and regulatory spotlight, I recommended to the remuneration committee that the annual bonus was forgone. It’s the right thing to do.” Gary Carter, a national officer at the GMB union, said: “Does South West Water have no shame? This scandalous behaviour has to end. It’s time Ofwat stopped water companies paying big bonuses and paying out huge dividends for such poor performances. Bosses must put their hands in their own pockets to stop pollution and sewage leaks. Customers should not have to pay for years of management failure.” Luke Hildyard, a director at the High Pay Centre, a campaign group, said executive pay often had “little to do with performance, ability or the value to society of their work”. He said: “Preventing intestinal parasites from flooding the tap water of your customers feels like quite a fundamental part of the job for the chief executive of a water company. It is surprising that failure to surpass this fairly minimal expectation not only nets a half-a-million-pound salary, but also a six-figure performance-related payout.” Pennon also announced that its chair, Gill Rider, would retire after the company’s general meeting next month. She will be replaced by David Sproul, a global deputy chief executive of the accountants Deloitte from 2019 to 2021 and the current chair of Starling Bank. Sproul will receive pay of £250,000. A spokesperson for Pennon said: “We understand the strength of feeling from our customers and the public around the issues facing the water sector. For the second year running, our chief executive, alongside other members of our executive leadership team, have therefore made the personal decision to decline annual bonus for the previous financial year.”",

        "title": "UK unemployment rising at fastest pace of OECD countries, analysis shows",
        "content": "Unemployment is rising in the UK at the fastest pace among 38 of the world’s richest countries, according to an analysis by the Trades Union Congress (TUC). In a release a day before official labour market figures are expected to show another increase in joblessness in Britain, the union body looked at data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) covering the first three months of this year. It found that of its 38 member states, only Costa Rica suffered a similar rise in the number of people losing their jobs between the start of January and the end of March. Every region of the UK was affected by rising unemployment and a falling number of job vacancies, the TUC said, illustrating the dislocation in the labour market between employers who cannot find workers with the right skills and rising joblessness. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to be published on Tuesday are expected to show a further rise in unemployment in recent months in a blow to Rishi Sunak’s message that the economy is growing robustly. The ONS confirmed last month that the economy had exited last year’s recession, growing by 0.6% in the first quarter of the year, and surveys of business leaders show rising levels of confidence about the prospects for economic growth. Consumer confidence has also risen this year in response to a rising level of average disposable incomes. However, employers have indicated that despite the recovery, they are seeking to reduce their headcount. Separate research by the Chartered Institute of Management (CMI) found that in the first three months of this year, more UK employers were drawing up plans to make roles redundant and impose hiring freezes than in the same period last year. The CMI survey of just under 1,000 British managers found that 35% of organisations planned to either freeze (21%) or reduce (14%) recruitment in the following six months. In the same period last year the combined total was 24%, while in the summer of 2022 it was just 15%, indicating a rising trend in the number of employers wanting to restrict or cut numbers of staff. When asked for the reasons behind the decision to freeze or reduce recruitment, three in five managers (60%) blamed worsening revenues or rising costs, while 55% cited organisational restructuring to reduce costs, and 34% said it was due to increased economic uncertainty. One in five managers also cited higher staff pay (19%) as the reason for reducing the number of employees, with a smaller number (13%) citing the increased use of digital technology and automation. Public sector employers were more likely to say they were planning to reduce staff numbers, with three-quarters saying budget cuts were the main reason. The research will add to concerns among some Bank of England policymakers about the weakness of the longer-term economic outlook. The central bank’s monetary policy committee will consider at a meeting later this month whether to bring interest rates down from their current level of 5.25%. In its latest labour market release last month, the ONS reported a declining number of job vacancies across the country, falling by 26,000 to 898,000 in the three months to April. The TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, said the weak jobs figures from the ONS and its analysis showed “just how out of touch Rishi Sunak and his government are – and this complacency is costing Britain dear”, adding: “The prime minister’s economic boasts are frankly laughable.” The OECD, which counts the US, France, Germany, Australia and Japan among its members, has urged politicians to invest in workers’ skills to boost employment after many people left the labour market during the Covid-19 pandemic, often as a result of ill health. The Conservative party election manifesto, due to be published on Tuesday, will reportedly include measures that Sunak will claim will save £12bn in benefits by the end of the next parliament by returning or keeping workers in the labour market.",

        "content": "Coles is limiting how many eggs its customers can buy around the country after a deadly strain of bird flu hit farms in Victoria. Signs in physical stores and on the Coles online store have notified customers of the restrictions, saying: “Due to supply issues, we have introduced a temporary limit of 2 items per transaction on eggs.” The highly pathogenic H7N3 strain of bird flu has been detected on five farms in the state’s south-west, with more than half a million chickens euthanised in an effort to stop the spread of the disease. The supermarket giant’s customers in every state and territory can now only buy a maximum of two egg cartons, with the exception of Western Australia. Coles said the limit was temporary but did not reveal how long it was expected to last. “We are working closely with all of our suppliers to ensure eggs remain available for our customers and we are providing support to the industry in responding to the avian flu cases in Victoria,” a Coles spokesperson said. Woolworths does not have any limits on egg purchases and no other national stores have publicised limits. Last week H7N3 was detected at a Lethbridge farm owned by Farm Pride in south-west Victoria, sparking a safety alert for all bird owners including farmers and households with backyard chickens. The Victorian Farmers Federation warned there would be an impact on egg supplies. “My advice is to shop around at your local grocer, market or small independent store to buy your eggs,” said Danyel Cucinotta, an egg farmer and the vice-president of the VFF. An alert issued by Agriculture Victoria said consumers should not worry about supermarket eggs and poultry products because they do not pose a risk and are safe to consume. The US has imposed restrictions on imports of Victorian eggs and poultry products.",

        "title": "Vehicle damage claims in Wales fall 20% since speed limit cut to 20mph, says insurer",
        "content": "Vehicle damage claims in Wales have fallen by 20% at one leading car insurer since the nationwide 20mph speed limit was introduced there last September. Wales was one of the first countries in the world, and the first nation in the UK, to introduce legislation for a default 20mph speed limit in built-up areas last year. The scheme has since been amended to give people more choice to rescind the limits in some places after half a million people signed a petition against the measure. The Welsh government said there was “generally universal support” for 20mph zones in areas near schools, built-up areas such as housing estates, and outside hospitals but there were other areas where people felt the measure was not suitable. However, Rob Clark, head of motor underwriting at esure, said: “We can see a clear drop in vehicle damage claims in Wales since the 20mph speed restriction was introduced in September 2023. During a time when we usually see these claims rise, they dropped and have continued to do so in the first quarter of 2024. The restriction is clearly having an impact.” There has been fierce opposition to the 20mph plan from the Conservatives in Wales’s Senedd. The Plaid Cymru leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, has said he supports the principle of widespread 20mph zones but pushed for more local power to review them as he said they had been “implemented very poorly and inconsistently” in some areas. Early results from sites trialling the scheme in 2022 showed a 3mph reduction in average speeds while data published by Transport for Wales in February this year indicated that speeds had reduced by an average of 4mph on the main roads that were monitored since the national rollout. The evidence of a drop in accidents comes as the Conservatives promised to introduce a law that would unilaterally limit the use of 20mph routes in Wales and reverse the expansion of London’s Ulez clean air zone, overturning the choices of voters in both regions. In a pledge that, if implemented, would mark a significant reversal of devolution, the Tories said that if re-elected they would immediately introduce a “backing drivers bill” that would use Westminster powers to quash local say over parts of transport policy. Rod King, the founder of the campaign group 20’s Plenty for Us, said the data from esure “confirms on a national scale the benefits from lower speeds not only reducing casualties and danger but also providing a benefit to drivers in reduced insurance claims”. He added: “The reductions are both statistically significant and timely in showing the reduction in road danger from implementing 20mph limits on a national basis. Statistically, some of those crashes which never happened would have resulted in death or injury for the road users involved. The national 20mph limits has already saved lives and injury.”",

        "title": "Stop Shein listing on the FTSE, workers’ rights campaigners urge",
        "content": "Workers rights campaigners have called for the UK’s next government to oppose the online fashion business Shein joining the FTSE, arguing that a London listing would be “yet another betrayal to working people everywhere and the planet”. Alena Ivanova, campaigns lead at Labour Behind the Label, said it had heard the news of senior British politicians courting Shein’s £50bn listing “with dismay” given what she claimed was a lack of transparency about its supply chain and ethical concerns. She highlighted: an investigation last month by Switzerland-based non-profit group Public Eye, which found that workers producing garments for Shein routinely work more than 70-hour weeks; exposés alleging forced labour in the Uyghur region of China; and the company’s “cavalier approach to design appropriation”, which has led to a string oflawsuits relating to allegedly copied garments. Mathias Bolton, head of commerce at UNI Global Union, which represents service industries around the world, said: “Shein shouldn’t be rewarded with the credibility of being listed in the City, or anywhere else, given the lack of transparency in their supply chain and shocking reports of severe labour violations.” The company, which operates largely from China, where it was founded, but is headquartered in Singapore, is rumoured to be planning to release documents outlining plans to list on the London Stock Exchange imminently. However, reports this weekend suggested it may not attempt to join the London market until September, after the election, when a Labour administration is expected to be in power. The campaigners voiced their concerns after the British Fashion Council (BFC), whose members include Burberry, Mulberry and Victoria Beckham’s fashion label, warned that Shein’s planned flotation on the London Stock Exchange was a “significant concern” to the industry. Caroline Rush, the chief executive of the BFC said that if the government welcomed Shein into the British fashion community, it must commit to “greater clothing market regulation and due diligence to ensure a level playing field for all businesses in the sector”. “Whilst we appreciate that Shein has committed to meeting acceptable industry standards, questions remain about the ethicality and sustainability of a business model and supply chain that consistently undercuts British designers and retailers,” she said in comments first reported by the Mail on Sunday. A Shein spokesperson said it “has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour, and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our supply chain seriously and have invested millions of pounds in strengthening governance and compliance.” The company said its supplier audits showed “a consistent improvement in performance and compliance”, including “improvements in ensuring that workers are compensated fairly for what they do”. It said research carried out by third-party auditors at Shein supplier facilities in China has found that basic salaries were on average twice the local minimum wage. Shein said it took copyright infringement seriously, adding: “It is not our intent to infringe anyone’s valid intellectual property and it is not our business model to do so.” The company said it had published a Modern Slavery statement on its website, as required by UK law, and added: “As a global company serving customers across more than 150 countries, we believe it is healthy to attract scrutiny and transparency and we want to be held to the highest standards.” The potential London listing of Shein is seen by some as a sign of hope for the City after a number of other major companies have chosen to list elsewhere. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, met the company earlier this year, while the Labour party has indicated its support for Shein’s potential London listing, which could be the UK’s biggest ever stock market flotation. However, some senior politicians, including three parliamentary committee chairs, have questioned the efforts to woo Shein, raising concerns about labour conditions in its supply chains. Labour said it had talked to Shein as the party sees “raising investment, productivity and growth” as a key mission for government, and added that it expected “the highest regulatory standards and business practices from any company operating in the UK”.",

        "content": "I can’t imagine the distress of knowing that promising cancer treatments like Enhertu exist, yet being unable to access them because the price is too high for the NHS (Women in England and Wales denied ‘exciting’ drug that can stop breast cancer spreading, 3 June). With the heavy encouragement of pharmaceutical companies, the blame for such shortfalls often falls on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), the public body that advises the NHS on whether medicines represent value for money. But high medicine prices, including that of Enhertu (average course of treatment: £117,857), are not some natural or necessarily occurring thing. While pharmaceutical companies are famously opaque when it comes to the real cost of producing drugs, it has been repeatedly shown that the NHS has been overcharged for similar cancer treatments. Most obviously, Trastuzumab, which is a key component of Enhertu, was previously sold in the UK at a price 10 times its actual cost of production. The non-availability of key drugs is the result of business decisions made by corporations whose primary interest is in keeping prices high to maximise profit. When people’s lives are at stake, this is inexcusable. Even more so when you consider that the monoclonal antibody technology on which Enhertu is partly based was developed with huge amounts of public funding from the UK’s Medical Research Council. In cases where medicines are priced out of reach of the NHS, the government should be prepared to override patents – supporting the manufacture of medicines domestically. Where the public has contributed to drug development, the case for strict conditions on pricing is even stronger.

        "title": "EU expected to impose import tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles",
        "content": "The EU is expected to notify China that it will impose tariffs on electric vehicle imports this week, firing the starting gun on a potential summer trade war with Beijing. A formal pre-disclosure of tariffs could happen as early as Wednesday, after a lengthy investigation into China’s state subsidies for its car manufacturing, which is predicted to conclude that massive support continues to be concentrated on the EV sector. Chinese manufacturers are already bracing themselves for new import duties, but experts anticipate that Beijing will retaliate with countermeasures that could hit a range of EU exports to the country, ranging from cognac to dairy products. After meeting the Chinese president, Xi Jingping, in Paris last month, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, warned that “the world cannot absorb China’s surplus production”, saying the EU would “not waver” from protecting industries and jobs inside the bloc. The anti-subsidy investigation was launched last October amid suspicions that China was flooding the EU with cheaper EVs as a result of overcapacity and dampened domestic consumer demand. It is one of more than a dozen inquiries being conducted by the EU into Chinese state aid, including an investigation into exports of solar panels, heat pumps and wind turbines, which the energy sector says are undercutting the EU by 50%. Experts suggest Beijing will see the imposition of tariffs as a test of strength, given that the electric car sector is fuelling China’s success in exports. They predict that Xi will not waver from the national bet he has made to dominate the green tech sector around the world through EVs, solar panels and electric vehicle batteries, instead seeing trade as a battleground where he can set the terms. Should the EU investigation conclude on Wednesday, as expected, that Chinese car manufacturers have won a competitive advantage, Beijing will receive a formal pre-notification of tariffs and will have four weeks to provide any evidence to disprove the European case. Any decision to apply tariffs permanently must be backed by member states in November, about 13 months after the launch of the investigation. If imposed, the tariff schedule would involve three tiers: individual rates for the sample of companies investigated by the EU, which include the world’s biggest EV seller, BYD; an average tariff for companies that cooperated with inquiries but were not fully investigated; and a residual tariff for those that were not investigated at all. The Rhodium Group consultancy, which specialises in research on China, said it expects the tariffs to be set at 15%-30%, which will be easy to absorb for conglomerates such as BYD, which launched its entry-level Dolphin hatchback in the EU last summer priced at just under €30,000 (£25,000). As part of its marketing push it is also an official partner of Uefa in the Euro 2024 football championship. “Some China-based producers will still be able to generate comfortable profit margins on the cars they export to Europe because of the substantial cost advantages they enjoy,” Rhodium said. “Duties in the 40-50% range – arguably even higher for vertically integrated manufacturers like BYD – would probably be necessary to make the European market unattractive for Chinese EV exporters.” China has long argued that it has not been subsidising its automotive sector, and even if it were, its exports help the countries of the west achieve their green targets. Earlier this week on a tour of Spain and Portugal the commerce minister, Wang Wentao, insisted cooperation with the EU was a “win-win” strategy. “I hope that the European side will abandon protectionism and return to the correct path of dialogue and cooperation,” Wang said, calling on Spain to easy “anxiety” over a potential costly rift. He said the overcapacity the EU keeps talking about is not an excess of production capacity but an excess of anxiety, and the so-called market distortion is not a distortion of the market but a distortion of mindsets. Western governments say China can easily modulate its strategy, absorb tariffs and compete on a level playing field, but it cannot be allowed to dominate the future clean energy and tech market. European consumers have already paid a heavy price through higher energy bills after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed the EU’s over-reliance on Russian gas, and EU officials are determined not to repeat the mistake with China, pursuing an official “de-risk” strategy.",

        "content": "Football fans are predicted to spend £2.75bn on items including beer, pizzas and new TVs during the men’s Euro 2024 tournament, which kicks off this week, providing a much-needed boost to retailers, pubs and bars. In the pubs sector alone, the British Beer &amp; Pubs Association is expecting an extra 20m pints to be sold over the four weeks of the first major summer men’s tournament since the pandemic without social distancing restrictions. The estimated 300m pints served will bring in an extra £94m for publicans. The wider hospitality sector could receive a £613.7m boost, according to research by industry analyst GlobalData Retail for the website Vouchercodes, while retailers are in line for a £2.1bn windfall from sales of goods such as televisions and sportswear. An estimated 35.4 million supporters are likely to tune in and cheer or jeer the Three Lions and Scotland, helped by favourable kick-off times as the tournament is being held in Germany. Almost half are expected to head to their local pub, bar or restaurant to watch at least one game, a 115% increase on the last major international men’s event, the 2022 World Cup, held in Qatar during the winter months. High hopes for the England team mean fans are expected to spend an additional £172m on hospitality compared with the 2022 competition. One of the venues eagerly awaiting the first kick-off is Dartford Sports Bar in Kent, which was opened by Chris Michaelas and his partner April on the same day that Boris Johnson announced the first lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. “We were loading fridges, the DJ was setting up, and Boris went on the telly in the afternoon saying all pubs have to shut tonight,” said Michaelas. He said the Euro 2024 tournament would be the first to deliver them the takings boost typical for a summer sports event. “For the Euros in 2021, we had instructions about where to sit and the ‘rule of six’ and one-metre spacing. We were unfortunate with the one-off winter World Cup last Christmas because it overlapped with our Christmas bookings, where we normally have a peak, and it watered that peak down a bit. “This is our first proper summer tournament as a company. Our turnover will double – that’s the simplest way of putting it.” The venue is doubling its staff to 20 for the first England match of the tournament and has sold 1,000 tickets for games, which will be shown on 24 screens in the bar, while the sound will be piped into the garden and even the toilets. Michaelas said the multicultural nature of the area had also delivered a boost, as groups of people had booked to watch matches involving Poland, Ukraine, Hungary, Turkey, Slovakia and Scotland. “We’re just praying for good weather.” Retailers are hoping that a bit of sunshine will help fuel a £2.1bn spending spree on food, drink and equipment for barbecues and alfresco pizza making, as well as electrical goods, such as new TVs, sportswear, and merchandise. With TV sales lacklustre, and sports brands and retailers also hit by consumers reining in spending in the cost of living crisis, the 2024 competition could change fortunes. A final appearance for either of the two qualifying home nations will mean an even stronger boost to spending and a feelgood factor that could mean better business for those not selling products directly linked to the tournament. • This article was amended on 9 June 2024. Boris Johnson announced the first lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, not 2022, as an earlier version said.",

        "title": "After Rishi Sunak’s D-day disaster Labour need not worry about Tory tax claims | Larry Elliott",
        "content": "Any lingering doubts about the result of next month’s election have been dispelled by Rishi Sunak’s inexplicable decision to leave last week’s D-day commemorations early. Only the scale of the Tory defeat remains in question. Last week was supposed to be the start of the Conservative party’s fightback. The idea was to go hard on Labour’s tax and spending plans in the hope that it would make voters forget that they are poorer now than they were at the start of this parliament. The strategy got off to a decent start, mainly because it clearly rattled a Labour party still haunted by its traumatic defeat at the 1992 election. Want to know why Rachel Reeves is so obsessed with getting the national debt on a downward trend? Look no further than Neil Kinnock snatching defeat from the jaws of victory in one of the biggest poll shocks of modern times. Finding it hard to understand why Labour was so desperate to rubbish the claim that taxes would need to rise by £2,000 a household if Keir Starmer becomes prime minister? The idea of a Labour tax bombshell is not new; it was minted by the Conservatives during their successful 1992 campaign. What’s more, there are similarities between then and now. In 1992, the economy was only just coming out of recession. Interest rates had been raised aggressively to combat high inflation. The Conservatives had ditched a proven election winner for a grey technocrat. The shadow chancellor, John Smith, had gone out of his way to appear solid and statesmanlike, presenting Labour’s tax and spending plans in the form of a shadow budget. The then chancellor, Norman Lamont, found a way of cutting taxes in a pre-election budget so the scene was set for a contest dominated by the issue of whether hard-pressed voters were prepared to risk voting Labour. Not enough of them were, it turned out. The scars of that defeat run very, very deep, which makes it all the more strange that Starmer was caught unawares by Sunak’s £2,000 “bombshell” attack last week. James Bowler, the permanent secretary to the Treasury, had written to Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary, the day before the debate to say that the Tory dossier should not be presented as having been produced by civil servants. Starmer could have pulled the letter out of his pocket and instantly stopped Sunak’s attacks. The vehemence of Labour’s subsequent rebuttal speaks volumes. It was a clear mistake for Starmer to let Sunak make the £2,000 claim multiple times before dismissing it as “absolute garbage”. Another four weeks in which there is a 1992-style focus on Labour’s tax plans was the last thing Starmer wanted. As it happens, Labour’s concerns are misplaced. That’s partly because thinktanks such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Resolution Foundation and the Institute for Government have been as dismissive of Tory tax and spending plans as they have been of Labour’s. And partly it’s because the parallels with 1992 are not exact. For a start, Labour’s poll lead has been consistently higher – 20 percentage points or more – in the past year than it was in 1991-92. When Kinnock appeared at a rally in Sheffield a week before polling day, polls were showing Labour up to eight points ahead, but on election day Major secured an overall majority of 30. A second factor was that Major fought an effective campaign. Positioning himself as the underdog, he found a useful prop in a soap box which he took with him around the country. The then prime minister took a lot of stick from the media for seemingly spending much of his time in DIY superstores, but had tapped into something: voters spend a lot of time and money doing up their homes. Major seemed like an ordinary bloke, someone that people could relate to. Sunak lacks the common touch and, as last week’s blunder shows, is politically inept. Major was also fortunate that the seismic event that undid his premiership – sterling’s ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism – came five months after the election was held in April 1992. Black Wednesday was such a blow to the Tory party’s reputation for economic competence that it was not until 2015 that it again secured an overall majority. The economy was humming by the time of the 1997 election but Major was on the wrong end of Tony Blair’s first landslide. This time is different. The event that has undermined voter confidence in the Tories – Liz Truss’s disastrous seven-week stint in Downing Street – happened in the current parliament. The pound has recovered after flirting with parity against the US dollar but higher mortgage rates are a reminder of the market turmoil that followed Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous mini-budget. These recent events make it that much harder for the Conservatives to exploit the tactic that was so successful in 1992: the idea that things might be bad but they would be even worse under Labour. Starmer’s main attack line – that the Tories have presided over a catalogue of chaos – resonates with voters. Sunak kicked off the campaign by saying he had a plan and Starmer didn’t. That failed to move the dial so he is now trying a different approach: that Starmer does have a plan but it simply amounts to a plan to raise taxes and make pensioners worse off. Will this approach work? Not a chance. That was true before the D-day furore and it is even more the case now. Labour can stop worrying. There will be no repeat of 1992. Sunak is about to lead the Tory party to a defeat of epic proportions.",

        "content": "On the day before the 1992 general election, the bookmakers at Ascot were offering odds of 6-1 against John Major’s Conservatives winning. I was with the economist Roger Bootle, and we agreed that Labour, well ahead in the polls, was bound to win. It was pointless betting on the Tories, even at those odds. When the results came in we kicked ourselves. When I told Lord Kinnock, the Labour leader at the time, this story years later, he jokingly said I should have telephoned him from Ascot. He said that on driving back from canvassing in south Wales the previous week he and his wife, Glenys, had had an uneasy feeling that, notwithstanding the polls, the election was “slipping away” from them. We come now to the imminent general election on 4 July, the campaigns for which already seem to be boring, not to say annoying, so many people. Labour has been consistently ahead in the polls, while the fissiparous Conservatives are widely considered to be heading for a historic defeat. This time the bookmakers’ odds are very different. At the time of writing they are quoting 30-1 against the Tories, while Labour is on 1-41 to win the most seats – that is to say, a £41 bet on Labour would fetch you a mere £1. Most people seem to think that Labour is a racing certainty, even though they don’t regard Keir Starmer as inspiring. The nation has had enough of the impact of austerity, not least on the NHS. And Brexit is proving a bigger disaster by the day. The self-harm of removing freedom of movement is affecting so many areas of life and bureaucratic restrictions on trade are causing serious damage to business, and therefore to us customers. The two major parties have made the very topic of Brexit a no-go area – the Tories because they are responsible for it and Labour because, though it was right about Brexit, it is frightened of alienating the so-called red wall voters who deserted it last time. We are having a general election five years on from a landslide Conservative victory, won on the back of the slogan “Get Brexit Done”. Well, the Tories got it done, and now they are done for. Brexit has produced casualties all over the place. Even as I write, the unsurprising news comes over the airwaves that Labour’s plans for a major housebuilding programme are likely to be hampered by a shortage of construction workers caused by the xenophobic attitude towards our former European partners, resulting in an exodus of east European building workers. Now, I say Labour’s plans because – notwithstanding my cautionary tale about the 1992 election, the result of which has haunted Labour ever since – there can be little question that the Conservatives are in for a drubbing on 4 July. People have, frankly, had enough. His lies about Labour’s tax plans are only one of the many own-goals Rishi Sunak has inflicted on himself. True, the Liz Truss fiasco has damaged the Tories – for which Sunak was not responsible – but it was not just that. This government has been found out, as the accumulated damage of austerity since 2010 hits most people in one way or another. Sunak was a Brexiter from the start. The dramatic negative impact of leaving the single market has shown up in the nation’s miserable growth performance. The Centre for European Reform has estimated that UK annual tax revenues would have been about £40bn higher if the country had not left the EU. These losses have impelled both major parties to deny that they plan to raise taxes, and the British public to tell pollsters they believe taxes will be raised anyway. As Robert Shrimsley of the Financial Times says: “The Conservative party has become the last casualty of Brexit.” It was symbolic of the low to which the party has sunk that the prime minister had to apologise for leaving the D-Day commemorations insultingly early to attend a television interview in London where he denied lying about Labour’s tax plans. As one friend of mine quipped: “Finally a [Brexit] prime minister apologises for leaving Europe.” Brexit is fast becoming a tragedy. As what has happened since D-Day reminds us, the stability and peace in Europe since the second world war are the achievement of an economically united Europe – until the Brexit catastrophe. The Russian moves in Ukraine, and fears of further revanchism by Moscow in eastern Europe lay a huge responsibility on a Starmer government. Economically, Starmer’s ambitions for growth require a closer relationship with the EU, not least the single market. And to meet the wider geopolitical threat, especially if a future President Donald Trump distances himself from Europe, we in the UK need to stop distancing ourselves.",

        "title": "UK growth since 2010 has been lacklustre and largely driven by immigration, says report",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak’s pre-election claim that the UK economy is now “going gangbusters” is undermined today by a report which argues that growth since 2010 has been “unspectacular” and has been the result of a rising population, caused principally by high levels of immigration. The study, Life in the Slow Lane, from the politically independent Resolution Foundation, will add to the consensus among economists and academics that the fundamentaleconomic problems and challenges facing this country are being dodged by the parties during the general election campaign. Both Labour and Tories have vowed to bring down immigration if they form the next government, while saying little on how they willincrease productivity through higher investment to stimulate real, long-term growth. The report says that population growth averaged 0.7 % a year in the UK since 2010, the equivalent of six million people, and has been the prime driver of what GDP growth that there has been. Three-quarters of this total population growth was the result of immigration. “Looking at GDP per capita, which accounts for population growth, the UK’s overall and relative performance is far worse,” the Foundation says. “GDP per capita has grown by a mere 4.3% over the past 16 years, compared to 46% in the years prior.” The report says the growing population has masked the UK’s “atrocious” record on productivity (output per worker) which grew by just 0.6% a year in the 2010s. Since the 2008 financial crisis. productivity growth has been the slowest for two centuries. Tory peer David Willetts, president of the Resolution Foundation, said: “Our report shows that crude figures on GDP growth exaggerate our performance because the population has been going up. The growth of GDP per head is far too low. We have got to boost investment to get the economy growing and the party manifestos have to recognise how serious the problem is and show how to tackle it. The campaigns so far haven’t really tackled this challenge.” Looking ahead, the report says that the employment boom of the 2010s is unlikely to to be repeated. Migration levels are expected to fall, from 685,000 in 2023 to around 350,000 annually over the next five years, while an unhealthy population and the fact that much of the UK’s large baby boomer cohort will be retiring, will put further downward pressure on future growth of the workforce. Greg Thwaites, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The extra 6 million people in Britain have certainly made the economy bigger, but have done little for GDP per capita. The UK’s record on productivity – which is what really matters for living standards – is exceptionally bad.” Since 2019, the UK has strengthened its position as the world’s second-biggest exporter of services after the US, the report says. But “far less welcome” has been its “weak performance on goods trade” with 57% of manufacturing businesses “still wrestling with the additional paperwork, customs duties and border checks which have increased exporting challenges post-Brexit.” Sunak has been claiming that the UK’s return to growth in the first quarter of 2024 means the economy is “going gangbusters”, in an attempt to boost the Tories’ election chances. The Resolution Foundation report puts Sunak’s claim into context: “A single quarter of growth doesn’t tell the whole story, however – what matters is the big picture of how the economy has been performing since 2010, where the picture remains one of stagnation since the financial crisis. In this context what ultimately matters for household living standards is not GDP growth but growth in productivity… On this measure, the 0.4% annual growth rate in productivity since 2007 is the lowest over an equivalent period in 200 years, and this has left the average real wage £14,400 below its pre-financial crisis trend.”",

        "title": "Tesla leads charge to defend Elon Musk’s $56bn pay package",
        "content": "Tesla’s shares are down 28% this year. It has warned of “notably” slower growth as sales in its second-largest market, China, fall. A defect forced a recall of its highly anticipated latest product. The chief executive spends a lot of time at other companies or generating controversy. How do you reward him? With a record-breaking $56bn pay deal, if Tesla gets its way at its annual meeting on Thursday. Elon Musk’s pay package – the largest ever granted to an executive at a US-listed company – is not based on Tesla’s current, or future, performance. It was granted in 2018, and built around targets for Tesla’s stock value, revenue and profitability. The targets seemed steep at the time, but after three extraordinary surges – in Tesla production, demand for electric cars, and the group’s share price – every goal was cleared by 2022. The company’s transformation into the world’s most highly valued carmaker propelled Musk into the ranks of the world’s very richest people. Back in January, a judge slammed on the brakes. Voiding the pay arrangement after a legal challenge by a Tesla shareholder, the Delaware court of chancery called his remuneration “an unfathomable sum”, and questioned whether compensating Musk at such levels was necessary to retain him as chief executive and achieve the company’s goals. Tesla was not prepared to take that decision in its stride. “Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value,” Robyn Denholm, Tesla’s chair, said in April, adding that the ruling had been “fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it”. The company organised a re-vote, urging investors to endorse the deal again. While the carmaker has sought to underline how the arrangement was tied to previous performance, the ballot is also seen by some as a referendum on the current state of the company, and Musk’s leadership. Denholm appealed to shareholders again last week, saying there was a risk Musk would step back from Tesla if they did not back his pay package this week. “If Tesla is to retain Elon’s attention and motivate him to continue to devote his time, energy, ambition and vision to deliver comparable results in the future, we must stand by our deal,” she wrote. Denholm added: “This is obviously not about the money. We all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018.” Investors are being asked to endorse two proposals: Musk’s pay, and the relocation of Tesla’s incorporation from Delaware to Texas. Musk signalled he planned to do the latter after January’s ruling, which prompted him to say that companies should never incorporate in Delaware. Tesla is likely to win approval for Musk’s remuneration, according to Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush and a veteran follower of the company, albeit “not by a wide margin”. Many shareholders in the company “understand the biggest asset of Tesla is Elon Musk,” Ives said. The two largest proxy advisory firms – which advise investors on how to vote – have come out against Musk’s pay. Glass Lewis and ISS both described it as “excessive”, prompting angry responses from Tesla. Glass Lewis had used “faulty logic,” it claimed, while suggesting that ISS had missed the point. Beyond the ramifications for Musk’s wealth, the vote over his pay will also test the power that proxy advisers wield over a company such as Tesla, which has a multitude of loyal supporters and Musk fans among its shareholders. Tesla, and Musk, have mounted a high-profile campaign to ensure they win. Last month the billionaire shared a glossy video on X, the social network formerly known as Twitter that he bought and renamed, which he claimed Tesla staff had made “of their own volition”. It urged investors to “protect Tesla” by voting for the carmaker’s proposals, warning that future growth was on the line. Musk has received support from some deep-pocketed backers. “Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla,” the billionaire investor Ron Baron said last week. That drive has earned the tycoon his fair share of critics. Trade unions are attempting to organise inside Tesla plants, claiming it is high time the company’s workers were handed their fair share of its profits. He faces questions, too, over how he divides his time with the rest of his empire, which includes X; the rockets and satellites group SpaceX; Neuralink, a brain implant start-up; and the Boring Company, a tunnelling venture. “Tesla will ultimately be victorious in the narrative where, if it’s not for Musk, we don’t have the EV [electric vehicle] transformation globally that we’ve seen,” said Ives. “He deserves the pay package: he executed. “But it’s at a time when Tesla is going through a difficult growth period. There’s category 5 headwinds, and Musk has created a lot of noise and controversy, which has frustrated some investors.” Victory on Thursday is unlikely to end the saga. Shareholders who oppose Musk’s pay deal are expected to challenge any effort to reinstate it.",

        "content": "The business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, is being pressed to question the Royal Mail bidder Daniel Křetínský on his business links, after the Guardian raised questions about a series of controversial global property deals connected to the Czech billionaire’s longtime business partners. Badenoch is scheduled to meet the tycoon next week to discuss his £3.57bn bid for the 500-year-old institution, which will be subjected to a review under the National Security and Investment Act. The government has not said it has any fundamental objection to the takeover, which is being led by Křetínský – a billionaire so enigmatic that he has been called the Czech Sphinx. The takeover promises to be a huge headache for the next government. The board of Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), last month backed Křetínský’s takeover. Dave Ward, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: “The government must give this takeover the highest level of scrutiny possible. The failed privatisation of Royal Mail and the deliberate and gross mismanagement of the company by its own board have created the circumstances for this takeover bid. It simply cannot be right that the only examination of this bid comes from that board and from individuals who would profit financially in any takeover.” The Labour party did not respond to invitations for it to comment. Ben Cowdock, the senior investigations lead at the campaign group Transparency International, said: “When ownership of critical infrastructure like Royal Mail changes hands, it is vital that the buyers are subject to rigorous due diligence to assess their suitability. Government should not only review buyers’ source of wealth but also whether they are ‘fit and proper’ to operate the business. “Background checks shouldn’t be just a light-touch review; they must take into account the business history of the buyers and their associates, with high levels of scrutiny placed on accusations against them. Failure to investigate prospective owners of vital British institutions raises the risk they’ll fall into the wrong hands.” On Friday the Guardian raised questions about the involvement in the bid of Křetínský’s longtime business partner Patrik Tkáč and the investment group he founded, J&amp;T. The company has been named as being connected to a number of controversial property deals which its spokesperson said “involve accusations of wrongdoing of clients with whom we had banking relationships not wrongdoing carried out by our group”. Tkac and J&amp;T own 44% of many of Křetínský’s best-known investments, including the vehicle that currently holds their minority stake in Royal Mail. The Slovakian tycoon and his company will also hold a significant position in IDS, should the takeover succeed. A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: “We wouldn’t be looking to provide commentary on what the secretary of state will raise in her meeting [with Křetínský] next week.” • This article was amended on 10 June 2024. Owing to an editing error, a previous version said that a vote on Daniel Křetínský’s offer would be held at the International Distribution Services AGM in September. This is not the case.",

        "content": "Tax rises “hiding in plain sight” that will cost UK households an average of £800 a year are already on the way whoever wins the general election, a leading thinktank has warned. While the Conservatives and Labour argue about what levies the other would introduce in power, the Resolution Foundation has warned that already announced measures will increase the total tax take by about £23bn a year by 2028-29. Neither party has committed to axing the moves from recent budgets and autumn statements, which include the continuation of the six-year freeze to income tax and personal national insurance thresholds and next spring’s reversal of temporary cuts to business rates, fuel duty and stamp duty land tax. Freezing existing tax rates increases revenue for the Treasury, since inflation and resulting pay rises mean more people are pulled into the higher-rate tax band, a process known as fiscal drag. Income tax thresholds have been frozen since 2022 and are expected to remain so until April 2028. The sum the Treasury is raising from taxes is at a historic high, the Resolution Foundation found, because of increases in corporate tax revenue and taxes on higher earners. The share of taxpayers paying a higher marginal rate of 40% or more has risen from one in 10 of the population in 2010 to one in six in 2023, the equivalent of 3 million more people. However, some middle-income earners are better off because of this year’s cuts in national insurance contributions. The analysis comes days after Rishi Sunak claimed in the first televised debate that Keir Starmer would raise taxes by £2,000 “for everyone”. The assertion was dismissed by the Labour leader as “absolute garbage” and refuted by the Treasury permanent secretary, James Bowler, who said ministers had been told not to suggest civil servants had produced the figure. The Conservatives were also censured by the UK statistics watchdog on Thursday over the claim. The Office for Statistics Regulation said it was concerned that those listening would have no way of knowing the £2,000 was not an annual tax rise but was a sum totalled over four years. Adam Corlett, the principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “History tells us that tax rises often come after general elections – and it is already very clear that there is enormous strain on public services – though this will be made harder if the parties continue to box themselves in on tax changes.” The study found that after the past eight elections, the first two fiscal events have introduced new tax policies that raised taxes by an average of £21bn a year. It came as a separate report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank, which calculated that the incomes of families with children have fallen by an average of £2,200 a year since 2010 after changes to taxes and benefits. The IFS found parents who were out of work have had the biggest fall in their incomes, losing £5,500 a year, but in-work families had their entitlements cut back. Among the changes affecting families with children are reductions in the level of child tax credits and the “two-child limit”, which restricts child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in most households. The IFS said the overall benefit cap also primarily impacted families with children.",

        "title": "Budget cruising isn’t dead – but the closure of P&O Cruises makes market sense",
        "content": "News of P&amp;O Cruises Australia being wound up may have stung those with fond memories of the brand’s uniquely Australian style of voyages. But experts say that although cruising remains popular, tastes are changing and new opportunities have appeared thanks to the widening of the Panama Canal. Announcing that P&amp;O Cruises Australia would be shut down in March 2025 and integrated into Carnival Cruise Line, owned by global ship operator Carnival Corporation, CEO Josh Weinstein said the decision was made because of the South Pacific’s small population as well as “significantly higher operating and regulatory costs”. The Australian market is a modest part of the operations for the world’s biggest cruise company, US-listed Carnival, representing about 5% of its revenue. In 2023, the Australian division generated US$1.2bn in revenue, compared with US$13.1bn in the US, and US$6.6bn in Europe, according to Carnival’s most recent annual report. Because of the larger populations and profitability of the northern hemisphere market companies deploy most of their ships to the Mediterranean and Caribbean. However, demand in Australia remains strong. The local cruise line industry has recently roared back to life, with passenger numbers in the most recent season surpassing the pre-Covid era, a revival considered remarkable for a sector once synonymous with the outbreak of the deadly pandemic. Carnival’s Australian division, which includes Cunard, Princess and Seabourn, is scheduled to make 846 domestic port calls in 2024, compared with 575 last year. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Meanwhile, Virgin global founder Sir Richard Branson visited Sydney in December to launch Virgin Voyages in Australia, which targets the adult, specifically singles, market. However, uncertainty about Middle East sea routes prompted the company to axe next year’s Australian season. P&amp;O has a long history in Australia. The Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company, as it was once known, initially ran steamships from Europe to Australia, mostly carrying goods and immigrants rather than tourists. “P&amp;O is a heritage brand that predates Australia as a country; people arrived here by P&amp;O ship in 1852,” says Chris Frame, a cruise ship historian and author of a recent book on the history of P&amp;O cruises. “This was a massive moment in Australia’s history because it had taken quite some time for the colonies to get a steamship service to the continent,” Frame says. “P&amp;O became a huge part of the Australian immigration story; it’s how so many people moved here to start a new life. And by the time the company launched a cruising service in the 1930s (a Sydney to Norfolk Island trip in 1932 that sold out in a single day) the brand was trusted, it had a place in the hearts of Australians,” he says. Cruising really took off in the 1930s in Australia. A slump in international trade caused by the Great Depression meant ships could dock for longer and passengers travel at a more leisurely pace. “These cruise ships weren’t like they are now; passengers used to form committees and organise their own fun to decide what activities they’d do. You’d see pictures of egg and spoon races on board,” Frame says. Then, in the 1970s, after the emergence of jet planes, P&amp;O repositioned itself as a budget friendly party ship rather than primarily a form of transport. “The real shift happened when P&amp;O bought Sitmar cruises and the Fairstar. [Fairstar] became the fun ship. She was cheap and cheerful and would do holidays to the South Pacific,” Frame says. “There was no dress code, there was nothing to worry about on board, and that’s where P&amp;O Australia got its current identity as being a really chilled out, Aussie experience.” It’s difficult to point to just one thing for P&amp;O’s demise, says Pierre Benckendorff, a professor of tourism business at the University of Queensland. New entrants, the comparative affordability of flying overseas for holidays post-Covid, and the growing influence of retired baby boomers flush with cash and whose tastes have grown beyond budget cruising – are among the factors. Benckendorff says that of Carnival’s 10 cruise brands – which range from high-end luxury to niche and budget options – the company’s largest, Carnival Cruise Lines, has been booming post-Covid. “More than anything, this is about how they want to position these brands, and it would be fair to say Carnival [Cruise Lines] has larger ships with higher capacity, and the brand is generating more profit than [it does] with P&amp;O. “Some of the P&amp;O ships were starting to get quite old too, and as they’re mostly smaller, it makes sense for the company to put their resources into the Carnival brand.” The widening of the Panama Canal in 2016 also meant it made sense to absorb the P&amp;O business into Carnival’s larger brand, with its bigger more modern ships. Consolidating fleets and registering them in the Caribbean, instead of in the UK, is a significant cost saving for the companies, according to Dr Patricia Johnson, a senior lecturer at the University of Newcastle’s business school. “It is only the widening of the Panama Canal that let loose these behemoth ships into the Pacific. Prior to that there was no way they could deploy their fleets from the Carribean to the Asia/Pacific without significant costs,” Johnson says. Benckendorff says instead of sailing big ships around the bottom of South America to the Pacific for the southern hemisphere’s summer season, they can now travel through the canal. Meanwhile, investment in new cruise ship facilities in Australia over the past decade means those larger ships can dock here, he says. Ultimately, P&amp;O’s closure reflects Carnival Corporation’s confidence in the strength of the Australian cruising market. “I would argue that the brand, as a cruise line, was becoming jaded as the ships aged, and the marketplace for cruises has become so competitive,” Johnson says. A Carnival Australia spokesperson said “there will be a small number of jobs that are lost”. However, experts have noted cruise lines have largely avoided employing large numbers of Australians as they’ve sought to raise margins in recent years. Benckendorff previously told the Guardian that companies operating in international waters aren’t subject to Australian minimum award wages; registering ships in places such as the Caribbean allows them to pay lower wages. Benckendorff says the Australian market has matured since the days of the Fairstar, shifting towards two key segments. “Most cruisers are either retired baby boomers looking for something to do with their money or they are families who get quite good value from a package that is all inclusive of food – it’s competitively priced against staying at a five-star resort,” he says. “I wouldn’t say budget cruising is dead but I think the market has shifted … Carnival wouldn’t have made this decision if they didn’t think they could fill the larger capacity ships.”",

        "title": "Asda-owning Issa brothers divide their empire as Zuber sells supermarket stake",
        "content": "The billionaire brothers who part-own Asda are separating their main business interests, with Zuber Issa selling his shares in the supermarket to the private equity firm TDR Capital. Zuber owned 22.5% of the Leeds-based grocery chain after a £6.8bn takeover alongside his older brother Mohsin and TDR three years ago. The sale of his stake had been expected for months, but was thought to have been complicated by lock-in agreements. The transaction will complete between July and September, after which point TDR will increase its stake from 45% to 67.5%, while Mohsin keeps 22.5%. Asda’s former owner, the US retailer Walmart, retains its 10% stake. The brothers, who share a £5bn fortune, according to the Sunday Times rich list, grew up in a terrace house in Blackburn, Lancashire. The pair, who are both in their 50s, made their fortune from petrol forecourts, starting their empire with one in Bury, Greater Manchester, after working in their father’s garage. After acquiring Asda in June 2021 with TDR, they folded part of their forecourts business, EG Group, into the supermarket chain last year. It was also announced on Friday that EG Group had sold its remaining UK petrol stations to Zuber for £228m. He said he would focus on leading and managing these sites, and spend more time on charitable endeavours. “With Mohsin and TDR’s ongoing focus and shareholding, I am confident that Asda will achieve its growth ambitions,” he added. Zuber will remain a shareholder and non-executive board member of EG Group, and the brothers will continue to have shared business interests in the sportswear brand Castore and the hydrogen lorry startup HVS. This week, research from the RAC motoring group showed that Asda is the UK’s most expensive supermarket fuel seller, after the retailer’s owners ditched its long-held pledge to be the cheapest on the market. The GMB union said TDR taking a bigger stake would be bad news for shoppers and staff. Nadine Houghton, its national officer, said: “TDR Capital has serious questions to answer about their asset-stripping of Asda. Their private equity ownership has already been bad for consumers – with Asda now the most expensive retailer for fuel – and bad for staff, with millions of working hours cut from the shop floor. “Further involvement from TDR can only spell more bad news. Bosses must change course to protect Asda workers and stop this British retailer further losing more market share.” Reports earlier this year suggested there had been a rift between the Issa brothers after the breakdown of Mohsin’s marriage, which was said to have “sent shockwaves” through the family. However, in March Mohsin Issa denied there had been an estrangement, saying the pair “get on exceptionally well”. The Issas have faced persistent questions about the financing of their business empire, having pushed through debt-fuelled deals at EG Group. They put just £100m of cash into the initial Asda deal, matched by £100m more from TDR Capital, with the remainder of the buyout funded with the largest sterling corporate bond sale on record, according to Bloomberg, as well as a loan from the parent company of EG Group. Last October, Asda acquired part of EG Group’s UK business for £2bn, giving it 356 predominantly freehold sites, including modern convenience stores on petrol filling stations, and further blurring the lines between the businesses. The deal was funded by an additional £770m of new loans and £450m in new funds from the Issas and TDR. Mohsin Issa said: “Asda is an iconic British brand and we are committed to setting it up for long-term success and delivering great value for customers across the UK. “I also want to add my personal support and best wishes for Zuber’s plans as we continue our successful family partnership, working as partners on our personal co-investments, family office philanthropy and Issa Foundation projects.” Gary Lindsay and Tom Mitchell, managing partners of TDR Capital, defended their record at Asda, saying they had made “significant progress in transforming” the chain. They added: “We have added a scale convenience business, grown Asda’s store footprint from 623 to 1,200 stores and food-to-go sites, and launched a hugely successful loyalty app, which now has 6 million active customers, accounting for around half of total sales.”",

        "title": "Former BP boss calls for end to new North Sea drilling licences",
        "content": "The former boss of BP John Browne has appeared to back a key Labour energy policy by calling for an end to new North Sea oil and gas drilling licences. The oil industry veteran, who was known as the Sun King when he ran the oil company between 1995 and 2007, said an important test for the UK’s political parties before next month’s general election was whether they have “serious plans for the country’s green energy transition”. He urged the next government to “call a halt” to new North Sea oil and gas projects to “reinforce our intention to get to net zero and show timely leadership”. His comments in the Financial Times are likely to be viewed as an implicit endorsement of the Labour party which has promised to end new oil and gas exploration, while the Conservative party has backed annual licensing rounds to “max out” the UK’s ageing oil basin. However, he suggested Britain should not aim for self-sufficiency on energy, and instead buy its oil and gas more cheaply abroad. Lord Browne said that the UK was likely to need oil and gas “for many years to come” and should allow existing North Sea fossil fuel projects to continue. “But beyond this, we should call a halt,” wrote the crossbench peer. “Such a move will reinforce our intention to get to net zero and show timely leadership. It is also hard to believe that finding and developing the very limited oil and gas resources that remain will be economic – or cost less – than buying supplies from the world market if needed,” Browne added. The comment appears to rebuff claims from the Conservative party that supporting further exploration of the North Sea will bolster the UK’s energy security and help to reduce gas bills. The claims have also been widely discredited by energy experts. The shadow climate secretary, Ed Miliband, said: “Lord Browne’s intervention adds his voice to the chorus of energy experts, including the International Energy Agency and the Climate Change Committee, who make clear that new oil and gas licences are not the right choice for Britain. “The only way to boost our energy security, strengthen our economy, protect our climate and ensure long-term, good jobs here in Britain is by managing existing licences while sprinting to develop the clean energy industries of the future.” Labour is also planning to toughen the government’s existing windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas profits, the proceeds of which will help to fund a publicly owned green energy company. GB Energy will have an initial capitalisation of £8.3bn over the length of the parliament to help scale up new green technologies and community energy projects. Browne, who pivoted from fossil fuels to set up a climate investing venture at General Atlantic in 2021, said the revenue from the UK’s remaining oil and gas production should be used to “accelerate the transition”. “That means more investment in wind and solar, and in infrastructure, including long-term storage, that can bring those supplies to market,” he added.",

        "title": "Stagflation: is Australia heading back to the 1970s? Our economics and business writers go head to head ",
        "content": "Australia posted its weakest economic growth – excluding the Covid-era distortions – since 1992 in the first quarter of 2024, we learned this week. Inflation, too, has ticked up lately rather than remaining on a downward trajectory towards the Reserve Bank’s 2-3% target range. Should inflation remain resistant to further falls, the bank’s governor, Michele Bullock, has said the RBA won’t hesitate to hike interest rates again – knocking more wind out of the economy. So is there a risk Australia’s economy could become stuck in a rut with high inflation and unemployment and no growth – a form of “stagflation”? Here, Peter Hannam first lays out the case against that grim conclusion before Jonathan Barrett argues the economy is facing both stagnation and inflation. We’re not livin’ in the 70s, thank goodness Hannam: Stagflation, like the great depression or the global financial crisis, is a term used by economic historians for a specific era. It refers to the 1970s and early 1980s when developed economies were dogged by high inflation and unemployment. GDP growth slowed markedly compared with the post-second world war boom. Skyhooks may have sung Living in the 70s but, save for the bit about “eatin’ fake food under plastic trees”, that period is a foreign land as far as today’s Australia goes. For one thing, Australia – and other major economies – have independent central banks now precisely to guard against a return to entrenched high inflation. Quarterly headline inflation in Australia peaked at 7.8% at the end of 2022 – well shy of the 17.7% spike in 1975 – and is on a bumpy but downward track. The jobless rate averaged 1.9% in the three decades or so to 1974. It soared to an average 7.6% in the 2o years afterwards, including over 10% in 1983. Compare that mix with our March quarter inflation of 3.6% and Treasury forecasting it may drop below 3% by the end of 2024. (The RBA’s own predictions, made pre-budget, aren’t so optimistic with a sub-3% CPI not achieved until late 2025.) Annual GDP growth might be ticking along at a meagre 1.1% but the economy is likely near its nadir – subject to a surprise shock – and should accelerate by year’s end. The boom years might be over for most nations but an extended Australian stall looks unlikely. Warren Hogan, Judo Bank’s chief economic adviser who thinks the RBA will need to hike interest rates again, says our economy has little spare capacity. Inflation will probably be wrung out of the system over the next year or so, and economic growth will be buoyed as artificial intelligence helps boost productivity, he says. The unemployment rate has been at or below 4% for most of the past two years – a level that would have been the envy of federal treasurers over the previous five decades. “This is not stagflation as we know it,” Hogan says. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Jonathan Kearns, a former senior RBA executive now at Challenger group who also wonders if monetary policy needs to be tightened further, says the labour market is “functioning remarkably well” given the economy is barely expanding. “We’re not going to see a substantial pickup in the unemployment rate,” Kearns says. Job vacancy numbers, due to be updated later this month, are turning lower but remain about 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Kearns says there’s no doubt “people are thinking about” stagflation. High inflation directly contributed to low GDP growth in the 1970s by disrupting companies’ efficient allocation of resources, but “it’s hard to argue” the current surge in prices in the 3-4% range is serving as a drag now. Twin Opec oil strikes contributed supply shocks in the 1970s – not entirely unlike the Covid chaos or even the scramble to wean off Russian energy imports after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. But most of those inflation pulses have been absorbed. Could a major disruption, such as a Chinese attack on Taiwan or a further heating up of the cold US-China trade war, tip Australia into recession accompanied by soaring joblessness and reviled inflation as new supply chains need to be linked up in haste? Yes, that might look a bit like stagflation. But at that point, collapsing real estate, stock and other asset markets – not to mention possible war mobilisation – might make the issue of stagnant growth and Bunnings being deprived of Chinese-made goods the least of our worries. Get out your bell bottom pants Barrett: The well-known fable about a frog not noticing it is being boiled alive is appropriate. Australia is probably already in stagflation, it’s just largely gone unnoticed. At a broad level, stagflation refers to persistent levels of inflation with moderate to poor economic growth, both of which are happening right now, as the recent tepid economic growth and consumer price data show. Many households will know this to be intuitively true because they have been feeling these forces for some time. Businesses are collapsing at decade-high rates. If there is a missing ingredient, it is higher unemployment – but that probably lies ahead. The bad news is that stagflation can be a long-term affliction, as it infamously was in the 1970s. That period was marked by global energy supply shocks, societal unrest and inwards-looking policymaking. Sound familiar? Unfortunately, it’s time to get out the bell bottom pants – because even though history doesn’t repeat, it’s already rhyming. We’re at the end of the first push to bring inflation under control, and we are seeing glimpses of a recession on the horizon. Armed with a single policy lever, the central bank will either keep rates elevated to subdue sticky inflation, or lower rates to stimulate growth, representing the stagflation conundrum. If it takes the expected path of using elevated rates, it will eventually bludgeon inflation down into its preferred band at significant expense to affected households, which are already losing their homes and scrimping on necessities. Unemployment will rise. At that point, someone will call a press conference to declare the inflation fight has been won. According to the stagflation script, policymakers will then stimulate a weak economy, and inflation will come roaring back, ushering in years marked by central bankers playing whack-a-mole with recessionary and inflationary pressures. Part of the stagflation view is almost philosophical because proponents understand there are always serious societal disruptions stemming from major events, like wars and pandemics. While there was a natural human desire to get back to the way it was after lockdowns, we instead got severe inflation, wrongfooting central bankers. Talk then turned to a heavenly soft-landing scenario; instead, the likely result will be years of economic purgatory. I appreciate that, as a version of the old joke goes, economic predictions make weather forecasts look good. What happens next is not set in stone, and creative policymakers can make a difference. On the bright side, Australia will probably fare better than many other advanced economies, as it did during the global financial crisis. The US is gripped by a bitter political divide in which the major parties will lean towards populist measures, potentially exacerbating the problem. Australia is not, however, immune from global forces, and the divide between big-spending and debt-free older cohorts and younger generations may get wider. Older generations have enjoyed the good fortune of investing during a prolonged period of low rates that has lifted the value of their retirement portfolios. Younger generations may not be so lucky.

        "title": "US dollar rallies as strong jobs report dampens rate cut hopes – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up… The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, a sign the labor market continued strong amid high interest rates, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Friday. The number of May jobs was far higher than the 190,000 economists had expected and topped April’s gains, when a revised 165,000 jobs were added to the economy. The report offered a mixed view of the jobs market. The unemployment rate rose to 4% for the first time since January 2022, up from 3.9% in April. The White House celebrated the news, which comes amid enduring public skepticism about the economy. “The great American comeback continues, but we still have to make more progress,” Joe Biden said in a statement. “On my watch, 15.6 million more Americans have the dignity and respect that comes with a job.” Here’s the full story: Goodnight, and have a good weekend. GW The US dollar is pushing higher against sterling, knocking the pound down by almost three-quarters of a cent to $1.2722. The White House council of economic advisors has published a thread on X, pulling out the key points from today’s jobs report: Today’s “very strong jobs report” has cast further doubt on the prospect of US interest rate cuts this year, reports James Knightley, chief international economist at ING: He explains: US May non-farm payrolls came in at 272k versus the 180k consensus and higher than any of the 77 forecasts submitted to Bloomberg – the range was 120-258k. Private payrolls rose 229k versus the 165k consensus expectation. There were 15k of downward revisions to the past 2 months for headline payrolls, but this is still an undeniably strong set of numbers that has seen market interest rate cut expectations reduce significantly. The gains were once again led by the usual suspects of private education &amp; health services (+86k), leisure &amp; hospitality (+42k) and government (43k). Average hourly earnings rose 0.4%MoM/4.1%YoY versus 0.2/3.9% in April and also hotter than expected. This jump likely received a boost from recent minimum wage increases in California. The White House has issued a statement on the May Jobs Report, highlighting job creation under the current administration. In it, President Joe Biden says: The great American comeback continues, but we still have to make more progress. On my watch, 15.6 million more Americans have the dignity and respect that comes with a job. Unemployment has been at or below 4% for 30 months—the longest stretch in 50 years. And a record high share of working-age women have jobs. I will keep fighting to lower costs for families like the ones I grew up with in Scranton. I’m fighting corporate greed by calling on corporations with record profits to lower prices—as Target and Walmart have for grocery prices. I’m fighting to make rent more affordable by building 2 million new homes. I’m fighting to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs, like insulin and inhalers. Congressional Republicans have a different vision—one that puts billionaires and special interests first. The Republican plan would increase inflation by repealing the Affordable Care Act, siding with Big Oil to raise utility bills, letting Big Banks rip off Americans, and blow up the debt by slashing taxes for billionaires. I will never stop fighting for Scranton—not Park Avenue. There’s a possibility that the US Federal Reserve may not be able to cut interest rates at all this year, suggests Janet Mui, head of market analysis at wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin. At the end of 2023, investors expected a flurry of rate cuts in 2024, but inflation has remained subbornly high while economic growth has also held up pretty well. Mui says: All in all, today’s bumper jobs number and sticky wage growth still skew toward the Fed keeping a tight policy stance. It will not give the Federal Reserve the confidence it needs to cut rates anytime soon. Markets are still pricing in at least one rate cut by the end of the year but there is a real possibility of no cut at all this year. All eyes are on the Fed’s economic projections, including its expectations for the path of the Fed funds rate next week.” Wall Street has opened in the red, as today’s strong US jobs report dampens hope of an early interest rate cut. The news that US payrolls swelled by a greater-than-forecast 272,000 in May, while average earnings rose by 0.4% in the month, is weighing on stocks. At the start of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 large US companies lost 74 points, or 0.2%, to reach 38,811.99 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has dropped by 0.3%, while the technology-focused Nasdaq is down 0.35%. David Goebel, investment strategist at wealth manager Evelyn Partners, says: “This report caps off a mixed bag of a labour market signals this week that does little to make the Federal Reserve’s job easier. “The headline non-farms number is a big upside surprise on the estimate, indicating a very healthy level of job creation. These gains were also broad-based, with the diffusion index, which measures the breadth of gains across industries, jumping to 63.4% in May from 56.6% in April. “Stronger than expected wage gains also contributed to the prevailing sticky inflation story. “At the same time, the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.0%, its highest since January 2022. This looks to be a function of decreasing household employment, which fell 408k, because the participation rate took a dip to 62.5%, which would have exerted downward pressure on unemployment. Today’s US jobs report is “a genuine surprise” compared with market expectations, says Daniele Antonucci, chief investment officer at Quintet Private Bank. Antonucci adds: Payrolls exceeded the highest predictions in the major forecasters’ polls, the unemployment rate held steady rather than rising, and wage growth was stronger than consensus both on a month-on-month and year-on-year basis. The latest figures don’t show any degree of softening, which was the baseline market scenario. Taken at face value, they represent a hurdle to the view that the labour market is cooling off. In turn, the implication is that the jobs picture is currently standing in the way of a Fed rate cut or two later this year. To be clear, one number doesn’t make a trend and, on balance, the higher rates stay elevated for longer, the more likely it is economic growth and inflation will slow. What little hope there was of a US rate cut in July (and there was never much) has been squashed by today’s jobs report. With job creation accelerating to 272,000 last month, and earnings growth rising too, Fed rate cut hopes have been doused. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, explains: “One step forward, two steps back. Today’s data undermines the message that other recent economic data have been giving of a cooling U.S. economy, and slams the door shut on a July rate cut. Not only has jobs growth exploded again, but wage growth has also surprised to the upside – both moving in the opposite direction to what the Fed needs to begin easing policy. We still expect the Fed to cut rates in September but another set of prints like today’s would likely also take that off the table. The positive news, however, is that with a labor market this strong, the US economy is nowhere near recession territory.” The Household Survey, released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics today, shows there were 6.6m unemployed people in America last month. That lifted the unemployment rate to 4.0% A year earlier, the jobless rate was 3.7%, and the number of unemployed people was 6.1m. The bigger-than-expected 272,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in May will soothe recent fears that the bottom had suddenly dropped out of the economy, say Capital Economics. They add: With average hourly earnings increasing by 0.4% m/m last month, the Fed will remain focused on the upside risks to inflation rather than the downside risks to the real economy. Today’s US jobs report is “something of a mixed bag”, says Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone. A blowout +272k headline nonfarm payrolls print beating all forecasts is being somewhat overshadowed by a net -15k revision to the prior two months of data, in addition to a surprising rise in unemployment to 4.0%, the highest since January 2022. Despite this, the report overall contained a hawkish bias, with hiring continuing apace, and earnings also growing at a hotter-than-expected 0.4% MoM, and 4.1% YoY, indicating that the labour market at large remains relatively tight. Unsurprisingly, the market reaction has been an aggressively hawkish one, with Treasuries and equities both slumping, as the dollar rallies to fresh day highs. Average earnings paid to US workers rose at a faster pace than expected last month, today’s jobs report shows. That’s a boost to employees but a headache for the Federal Reserve. Average hourly earnings rose by 4.1% year-on-year in May, and by 0.4% in the month alone. That also makes an early interest rate cut less likely, as solid wage growth will support inflation. The US dollar is rallying, as investors conclude that today’s strong jobs report makes an early cut to US interest rates less likely. The greenback has gained half a cent against the pound, pushing sterling down to $1.2738. Here’s a breakdown on where the US economy added jobs last month, from the Bureau for Labour Statistics: Health care added 68,000 jobs in May, in line with the average monthly gain of 64,000 over the prior 12 months. In May, employment growth continued in ambulatory health care services (+43,000), hospitals (+15,000), and nursing and residential care facilities (+11,000). Government employment continued to trend up in May (+43,000), in line with the average monthly growth over the prior 12 months (+52,000). Employment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up in May (+42,000), similar to the average monthly gain over the prior 12 months (+35,000). Employment in food services and drinking places continued to trend up over the month (+25,000). Professional, scientific, and technical services added 32,000 jobs in May, higher than the average monthly gain of 19,000 over the prior 12 months. Over the month, employment increased in management, scientific, and technical consulting services (+14,000) and in architectural, engineering, and related services (+10,000). Specialized design services lost 3,000 jobs. Social assistance employment continued to trend up in May (+15,000), primarily in individual and family services (+11,000). Over the prior 12 months, social assistance had added an average of 22,000 jobs per month. In May, employment in retail trade continued to trend up (+13,000), about in line with the average monthly gain over the prior 12 months (+8,000). Building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers added 12,000 jobs in May, while job losses occurred in department stores (-5,000) and furniture and home furnishings retailers (-4,000). The jobs reports that there was little or no change in other major industries, including mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; construction; manufacturing; wholesale trade; transportation and warehousing; information; financial activities; and other services. Newsflash: The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, much more than expected. That’s a rather stronger report than economists had expected – with Wall Street having forecast an increase of around 185,000 jobs. The latest non-farm payroll report shows that employment continued to trend up in health care; government; leisure and hospitality; and professional, scientific, and technical services. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics also reports that the US unemployment rate rose to 4% in May, from 3.9% in April. That’s the highest rate since January 2022. March and April’s jobs reports have been revised a little lower too. The BLS says: The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for March was revised down by 5,000, from +315,000 to +310,000, and the change for April was revised down by 10,000, from +175,000 to +165,000. Financial markets would probably be happiest with a jobs report which showed a small slowdown in hiring – to encourage interest rate cuts – but not large enough to suggest the US economy is in trouble. As Danish bank Saxo put it: If headline jobs growth comes in softer than expected, markets may try to bring forward Fed rate cut expectations, and that can fuel risk-on sending stocks higher and the US dollar lower as long as growth concerns do not over-rule the rate cut narrative. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict the jobs report will come in below expectations. They told clients: We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 160k in May, somewhat below consensus of +185k. When the labor market is tight, job growth tends to slow disproportionately during the spring hiring season and particularly in May—when the seasonal factors expect more hiring than is realistic with fewer workers available—and all five of the alternative measures of employment growth we track suggest a below-consensus report. On the positive side, we expect a tailwind from the longer-than-usual May payroll month. While the seasonal factors in principle adjust for these effects, it appears they may have been distorted by a weak payrolls reading in May 2019, which was also 5 weeks long. A strong US jobs report today could rock the markets, warns Achilleas Georgolopoulos, investment analyst at XM: The stock markets could go into a tailspin if there is a significant upside surprise today. For example, a 250k+ print in the non-farm payroll figures could push the S&amp;P 500 index decisively lower and help the 10-year US Treasury yield flirt with the 4.5% level again. The Fed does not like acute market reactions and remains fearful of a repeat of the March 2023 bank failures. Excitement is building in the financial markets ahead of the latest US jobs report, due in just over half an hour. May’s non-farm payroll will show how many jobs were created across the American economy last month. It will be released at 1.30pm UK time, or 8.30am EDT. That, and the latest wage data, will be a crucial factor in how soon the US Federal Reserve feels confidence to start cutting US interest rates. Economists predict the NFP will show around 185,000 new jobs were created in May, which would be a small increase on the 175,000 in April (although that number could be revised today). Wall Street also expects the unemployment rate to remain at 3.9% in May, while average monthly earnings growth could rise to 0.3%, from 0.2% in April. Henk Potts, market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, sets the scene… “The US economy continues to be resilient and its labour market remains in relatively rude health. Around 200,000 nonfarm payroll jobs are expected to have been created in May, compared with 175,000 registered in April, with the unemployment rate set to remain at 3.9%. We anticipate that we could see a further softening in labour market conditions, but expect that the unemployment rate will peak at just 4% in the coming months, which would still be low when compared to historical standards.” In other UK supermarket news, Waitrose has snapped up restaurant meal kit brand Dishpatch, expanding its direct-to-consumer business. The finish-at-home meal kit business was founded in 2020 and offers customers meals designed by celebrity chefs including Angela Hartnett, Michel Roux Jr and Rick Stein. Waitrose – the grocery arm of the John Lewis Partnership – said it sees “significant opportunities” for Dishpatch following the deal. Dishpatch customers can order food from more than 40 menus, with food and wine delivered on Fridays and dishes pre-prepared to be finished and served at home. Just in: Russia’s central bank has left interest rates on hold, but threatened to raise them in coming months to fight inflation. The Bank of Russia has just announced it is maintaining interest rates at 16%. It warns that inflation in Russia has stopped falling, and that domestic demand for goods and services is rising faster than the economy’s ability to meet it (which is inflationary). According to the estimate as of 3 June, annual inflation stood at 8.1% after 7.8% at the end of April, the Bank says. And it drops a clear signal that rates could be raised soon, saying: The Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of increasing the key rate at its upcoming meeting. Furthermore, returning inflation to the target will require a significantly longer period of maintaining tight monetary conditions in the economy than it was forecast in April. According to the Bank of Russia’s forecast and given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will return to the target in 2025 and stabilise close to 4% further on. Germany’s central bank has cut its growth forecasts, in another blow to Europe’s largest economy. The Bundesbank now expects growth of just 0.3% in 2024, below the 0.4% forecast in December. For 2025, it now sees growth of 1.1%, weaker than the 1.2% forecast before. The Bundesbank says thee German economy is “slowly regaining its footing after a roughly two-year period of weakness”. As Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel puts it: The German economy is extricating itself from the period of economic weakness. Nagel adds that “We on the ECB Governing Council are not driving on auto-pilot when it comes to interest rate cuts.”, a day after the first cut in eurozone interest rates in five years. Newsflash: the long-anticipated business break-up of the billionaire brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa has been agreed. Zuber Issa has sold his 22.5% stake in Asda supermarket, which the brothers bought in a leveraged buyout in 2020, to fellow shareholder TDR Capital, the private equity firm. Thsi will take TDR Capital’s total shareholding to 67.5%. Mohsin Issa will continue to own 22.5%, with Walmart owning the remaining 10% This follows report of a rift between the brothers, following the breakdown of Mohsin’s marriage which is said to have “sent shockwaves” through the family. And in another development, EG Group – the petrol station and convenience store chain founded by the brothers – has just announced the sale of its 'remaining UK forecourt business’ to Zuber Issa for £228m. He is also stepping down as co-CEO of the business. Zuber Issa says: Since Mohsin and I, alongside TDR, took ownership of Asda, we have driven a period of significant investment and entrepreneurial growth activity. Notably, Asda acquired a market-leading UK convenience retail and foodservice store business from EG Group. With the divestment of my Asda shares, I will now turn my attention towards leading and managing the remaining EG UK forecourt sites that I have personally acquired, and spend more time on my charitable endeavours. There were reports back in February that such a deal was being explored. The takeover of Asda by the Issa brothers and TDR put billions of extra debt onto Asda’s balance sheet. Today, the supermarket says: Asda’s net debt at the end of Q124 was £3.8bn, net of more than £1bn cash on the balance sheet – and the business is fully committed to further deleveraging. We also have confirmation that the eurozone returned to growth in the last quarter, but didn’t expand as fast as the UK. Data bosy Eurostat has reported that eurozone GDP rose by 0.3% in January-March, in line with its previous estimates, after a 0.1% fall in October-December. That’s broadly in line with the US, which grew at an annualised rate of 1.3% in Q1 2024 (or just over 0.3% in the quarter). But the UK posted growth of 0.6%, as the economy exited recession. Global food commodity prices have risen again, in a blow to households worldwide. The United Nations world food price index rose for a third consecutive month in May, as falling prices for sugar and vegetable oil were counted by rising prices for cereal and dairy products. Prices rose by 0.9% in May compared with April. But, that still left the FAO Food Price Index (FFPI) 3.4% lower than a year ago, and nearly 25% below the peak of 160.2 points reached in March 2022, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drove up prices. Cereal prices jumped by 6.3% in March, which the UN attribues to “growing concerns about unfavourable crop conditions for the 2024 harvests” and “damage to the Black Sea shipping infrastructure”. Dairy prices rose 1.8% in the month, due to “increased demand from the retail and food services sectors ahead of the summer holidays”, and expectations that milk production may fall below historical levels in Western Europe. But sugar prices fell by 7.5%, due to a “good start” of the new harvest season in Brazil, and “conducive weather conditions” boosting the global supply outlook. And vegetable oil prices dropped by 2.4%, driven by a fall in the cost of palm oil as outputs across major producing countries in Southeast Asia rose. These higher commodity costs will feed through to shoppers, and may slow the fall in food inflation. There could be a ‘bounce’ in house prices this autun, predicts Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, if interest rates start to fall. Bill says: “House prices remain under pressure as an interest rate cut moves further over the horizon. Demand will typically rise in spring but there has been a 0.3% price decline over the last three months thanks to stubborn services inflation and rising swap rates. There should be a more noticeable bounce this autumn when the first rate cut since March 2020 is likely to have happened and the political backdrop will have stabilised. We expect UK prices to rise by 3% this year as the prospect of more mortgages starting with a ‘3’ gets closer.” We’re not there yet, though! Here are the latest fixed-rate mortgage rates, just released by Moneyfacts: The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.95%. This is unchanged from the previous working day. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.52%. This is up from an average rate of 5.51% on the previous working day. The maker of Bulmers, Magners and Tennent’s cider has announced the shock departure of its CEO after revealing it had overstated its profits in recent years by €5m. C&amp;C told the City that detailed internal and external reviews had discovered a series of mistakes in its accounts in recent years. This means it will take a €1m adjustment charge for the 2023 financial year, a €3m adjustment credit in FY2022 and a €7m adjustment charge in FY2021. And CEO Patrick McMahon is paying the price; he’s leave his role, having stepped up from his position as finance chief a year ago. C&amp;C explains: The Group’s Chief Executive Officer, Patrick McMahon, was Chief Financial Officer during the periods to which these adjustments relate and acknowledges that the relevant shortcomings occurred at a time when he had overall responsibility for the Group’s finance function. Accordingly, he has informed the Board that he will step down as CEO and as a director with immediate effect. C&amp;C also reported a loss of €111m for the last financial year, down from a profit of €52m a year before. Shares in C&amp;C are down 7% in early trading, the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index. Bellway has also raised its forecast for the overall average selling price of its houses to around £305,000, up from previous guidance of £295,000. This is “mainly due to changes in product mix”, says Bellway – meaning it expects to sell more high-end, pricier, homes. UK housebuilder Bellway has issued an upbeat trading statement, saying it has seen “stronger trading through the spring selling season”. Bellway says “improved affordability” is helping to lift customer confidence, leading to an increase in reservations for new houses and “firm” prices. Bellway’s private reservation rate per outlet has risen to 0.62 per week in the February-May quarter, a 6.9% increase on a year ago. Jason Honeyman, Bellway’s CEO, says the company is on track to build around 7,500 homes this financial year, adding: We have been encouraged by ongoing healthy levels of customer interest and combined with the strength of our outlet opening programme, we continue to expect a year-on-year increase in the forward order book at 31 July 2024. As a result, Bellway remains in a strong position to return to growth in financial year 2025. The recent rise in mortgage rates is likely to prevent any meaningful pickup in transactions and prices in the short-term, predicts Peter Arnold, chief economist at EY UK. But Arnold also suggests we won’t see a new downturn in prices either… saying: “While 2023 was a challenging year for the housing market, data for the first half of 2024 has suggested that the market has passed the bottom. The substantial fall in mortgage rates since last summer, combined with strong growth in nominal wages, has reduced the scale of the mortgage affordability problem. This has helped to entice some buyers back to the market, leading to a recovery in transactions and putting a floor under prices. “Over the past couple of months, mortgage rates have edged up again in response to rising swap rates, as financial markets anticipate a slower pace of Bank of England interest rate cuts. This is likely to prevent any meaningful pickup in transactions and prices in the near-term. But so far, the increases have been small and mortgage rates remain well below last summer’s peaks. The EY ITEM Club does not expect to see a renewed downturn in the housing market. Building up a deposit to buy a house is a large hurdle for first-time buyers, especially those who can’t turn to wealthy parents for help. But the Labour Party are pledging to help – last night, they annouced they would permanently sustain and expand the current mortgage guarantee scheme. The measure sees the government act as guarantor for part of a home loan – to encourage lenders to make low-deposit mortgages available for first-time buyers, Labour, whose offering is dubbed ‘Freedom to Buy’, says it will help over 80,000 young people to get on the housing ladder over the next five years. Labour leader Keir Starmer says: “After 14 years of Conservative government, the dream of home ownership is out of reach for too many hard working people. Despite doing everything right, they can’t move on and up. A generation face becoming renters for life. “My parents’ home gave them security and was a foundation for our family. As Prime Minister, I will turn the dream of owning a home into a reality. “Our changed Labour Party will be on the side of the builders not the blockers, to get Britain building again. My Labour Government will help first-time buyers onto the ladder with a new Freedom to Buy scheme for those without a large deposit, and by giving them first dibs on new developments. Labour are also pledging planning reform to build 1.5 million homes, saying this is the best way in the long term. They say: We will reintroduce housing targets, build on disused grey belt land, fast track permissions on brownfield and build the next generation of new towns. Over the last quarter, average UK house prices were 0.3% lower than in the previous three months, Halifax reports. This chart shows the monthly changes we’ve seen this year: After jumping 1.2% in January, they grew 0.3% in February, before dropping 0.9% in March, stagnating in April and then dipping 0.1% in May. House prices rose fastest in the North West of England in May – they were up 3.8% on an annual basis in May, taking the average price to £232,258. In Northern Ireland, prices rose by 3.2%, while in Scotland they were 1.9% higher than a year ago. In Wales, house prices grew annually by +0.7% – below the UK average of 1.5%. Prices fell fastest in Eastern England, where they dropped by 0.8% in the year to May. In London, prices have risen by 0.2% over the last year, to an average of £536,821 – still the most expensive part of the UK. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Stability has returned to the UK housing market, the latest data from lender Halifax shows, with prices dipping slightly last month. Halifax’s latest house price index, just released, shows that average prices were little changed month-on-month in May, The average house prices slipped to £288,688 last month, a 0.1% drop compared to £288,862 in April. But on an annual basis, house price inflation rose to +1.5% in May, up from +1.1% in April. Rising wages and a pick-up in economic confidence are supporting house prices, says Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax. Bryden explains: This has been reflected in a broadly stable picture in terms of property price movements, with the average cost of a property little changed over the last three months. Bryden adds that a period of relative stability in both house prices and interest rates should lift confidence for both buyers and sellers. While homebuyers and those remortgaging will continue to respond to changes in borrowing costs, set against a backdrop of a limited supply of available properties, the market is unlikely to see huge fluctuations in the near term. Last week, rival lender Nationwide reported a rise in prices last month. It’s important to remember, though, that both Halifax and Nationwide’s data is based on mortgage transactions, so doesn’t capture cash buyers.

        "title": "US adds 272,000 jobs as labor market holds unexpectedly strong",
        "content": "The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, a sign the labor market remained strong amid high interest rates, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Friday. The number of May jobs was far higher than the 190,000 economists had expected and topped April’s gains, when a revised 165,000 jobs were added to the economy. The report offered a mixed view of the jobs market. The unemployment rate rose to 4% for the first time since January 2022, up from 3.9% in April. The White House celebrated the news, which comes amid enduring public skepticism about the economy. “The great American comeback continues, but we still have to make more progress,” Joe Biden said in a statement. “On my watch, 15.6 million more Americans have the dignity and respect that comes with a job.” Unemployment has now been at or below 4% for more than two years – the longest streak in over 50 years. But the pace of hiring had slowed considerably in recent months, from 315,000 new jobs in March to 175,000 new jobs a month later. That month-over-month decrease was taken as good news by Wall Street, as a cooling labor market could encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The latest report is likely to reinforce the Fed’s resolve to keep rates high. Though Wall Street had long hoped interest rates would come down by the summer, officials at the Fed continue to be skeptical about a rate decrease amid disappointing inflation figures. Inflation was at 3.4% in May, still above the Fed’s targeted rate of 2%. Previous signs of cooling in the labor market included the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ job openings and labor turnover survey from earlier this week, which showed there were just over 8m open job positions in the US at the end of April, the lowest number since February 2021 and down 1.8m over the year. According to the executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, layoff figures have held steady, with US-based employers announcing 63,816 jobs cuts in May, around the same number of cuts announced in April. Layoffs are down 20% from this time last year, when a handful of major tech companies were announcing job cuts. The Fed will hold its next federal open market committee meeting next week and is expected to announce on 12 June whether officials will change interest rates. Interest rates are currently at 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest rates in nearly two decades. On Thursday the European Central Bank cut its interest rate for the first time in almost five years but few expect the Fed to follow suit this week. At their last meeting in early May, Fed officials said inflation was still too high above their targeted rate of 2% to cut rates. In May, inflation stood at 3.4% – higher than its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but also above the rate in June 2023, when it hit 3%. Inflation has not been below 2% since February 2021. “It is likely that gaining confidence will take longer than previously expected,” Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said after the meeting in May. Federal officials are trying to manage a tough balancing act in seeking to bring price increases down to a manageable level without offsetting the labor market too much.",

        "title": "‘Cannot be trusted’: traditional farming voter base turns away from Tories",
        "content": "“Since I first voted for Thatcher in 1979, I’ve always gone Conservative,” says the Hertfordshire farmer Andrew Watts – a longer period than the three decades he has been managing his cereal farm near the village of Puckeridge. But when he enters the voting booth on 4 July, the 64-year-old will be backing the Liberal Democrats. Watts says the switch is partly down to what he calls a “lack of coherent agricultural policy” from Westminster, but he mainly blames it on a loss of integrity within the Tories in recent years. “I think their policies have ignored rural areas, and ignored the importance of food production,” he says. “The performance since Brexit has shown that this government cannot be trusted.” Watts’s frustrations tally with those of a growing number of English farmers, whose disillusionment could overturn the Conservatives’ long-assumed status as the party of the countryside. Whether it is the international trade deals that have removed tariffs on most Australia and New Zealand meat, which many feel undercut domestic livestock farmers, or delays to post-Brexit payment schemes, which have left many struggling financially, its traditional farming electorate in England is feeling unhappy and taken for granted. “No industry, no part of British society, has been more betrayed or let down by the Conservative government than farming,” says Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for agriculture. “I spend a lot of time with farmers; you see deep anger.” The polling supports that claim, with a YouGov constituency-by-constituency poll this week suggesting Rishi Sunak’s party could lose rural voters. In 2019, the 87 constituencies in England with the highest number of National Farmers’ Union (NFU) members elected Conservative MPs. YouGov’s poll predicts that of the 59 of those constituencies that have kept the same name, the Conservatives would hold on to only 32, with Labour winning 16 and the Lib Dems 11 . A survey of 430 farmers by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit last month recorded Tory support at 32%, down from 41% in 2019, while support for the current opposition hit 35%. Labour clearly sees an opportunity. Buoyed up by byelection victories over the Tories in rural constituencies such as Mid-Bedfordshire and North Yorkshire’s Selby and Ainsty, the party is now targeting previously out-of-reach rural seats. Keir Mather, who overturned a 20,000 Conservative majority in Selby last July, says: “I think farmers are giving Labour a fair hearing in a way they haven’t done previously, because they have been so badly let down over the past 14 years.” He says farmers face “enormous pressures” including workforce shortages, supply-chain disruption and low prices from the food industry and supermarkets. “If you combine that with a government that is taking insufficient action to deal with things like flooding, which devastate farmers across my local community, you can quickly see why farmers are feeling dispossessed.” Sensing a fracture in the relationship with the party’s rural base, Sunak has responded with a charm offensive. After a disastrous NFU conference in 2023 – when farmers booed the then environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey – this year Sunak became the first prime minister to attend since Gordon Brown in 2008. He told the audience he “had their backs” and would change the culture in government around agriculture, while announcing the “largest-ever grant scheme” for farmers, with £427m given to technology and productivity schemes. The launch of his Farm to Fork summit at No 10 last month on food production and security was another attempt to show he is listening. But some think it could be too little, too late. An annual survey for the NFU in April put farmer confidence at its lowest level since records began in 2010. The phasing out of the EU’s basic payment scheme was named the most significant issue shaping the year ahead, with 86% saying the change would have a negative impact. The programme gave a guaranteed payment for food production each year, but now farmers face having their subsidies cut by as much as half. Its replacement, the sustainable farming incentive (SFI), incentivises farmers to maintain and enhance nature and reduce carbon emissions. While the principles have been welcomed by most parties, its rollout has been beset by delays. “It’s only really now we have a clear sight of what that support structure looks like,” says Robert Craig, a Cumbrian dairy farmer and chair of the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers. “It’s ridiculous, that’s eight years of uncertainty. Make no mistake a lot of farmers, particularly upland farmers, are hugely reliant on payments.” Uptake for the SFI is steadily increasing, with 17,000 applications in as of April. Craig was himself chair and president of the Conservative party in Penrith until 2019 before resigning when local MP Rory Stewart was suspended over his opposition to Boris Johnson’s Brexit agenda. He says he will be voting for the Lib Dems after the government’s approach in recent years has left him “politically homeless”. Other farmers expressed anger at post-Brexit trade deals with Australia and New Zealand, which remove tariffs on beef and lamb. Many livestock farmers fear being undercut by a flood of cheap imports and say they were not listened to during negotiations. Unhappiness at the deals were one of the motivations behind the tractor protests around the country in February and March, including at Dover and in Westminster. Wiltshire-based farmer and founder of Save British Farming, Liz Webster, who organised the protest in Parliament Square, called them the “worst trade deals in the world” which would “slaughter” British farmers. Some disenchanted farmers have sought new political homes. Watts says his switch to the Lib Dems is partially down to policy, but also the people. The Hertforshire farmer believes that the Tories have become too “Westminster-centric” and out of touch with the countryside. “There are a few people that understand agriculture and rural areas but when you have people like Liz Truss who is in a rural constituency but doesn’t understand rural issues, you despair,” he says. However, George Dunn, chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, says most conversations with members about the election are not about switching allegiance, but whether they will vote at all. Anna Longthorp, who farms pigs near Goole, East Yorkshire, is one such person. Having always voted at a general election, mostly for the Conservatives, the 41-year-old now sees herself as politically homeless. Longthorp says her decision to turn away from the Conservatives came in 2021 when at least 40,000 pigs were culled due to a lack of abattoir workers. “It was when the pig crisis hit – that did it for me. When Boris Johnson basically laughed at the situation when being interviewed, and said pigs being culled was no different to them being put into the food chain,” she says. Voting this July is about “picking the least worst … None of the parties seem to find farming that important,” she says, adding that many of her colleagues in the sector feel the same. Without efforts to reconnect, such voters could be lost in future elections, not just to the Conservative party but to politics altogether.",

        "title": "Labour urges Tories not to hand out leaflets it says Frank Hester has paid for",
        "content": "Labour has written to Conservative candidates urging them not to hand out election material that they say is paid for by the party’s biggest donor, Frank Hester, who has been widely condemned for allegedly making racist remarks. Hester, who has donated £15m, is bankrolling about 40% of the Conservative party’s national spending in the election. Rishi Sunak has been under pressure to hand the money back since the Guardian reported in March that Hester said to colleagues in 2019 that looking at Diane Abbott made you “want to hate all black women” and that she “should be shot”. The prime minister faced fresh calls to give up the money on Thursday after the Guardian revealed further allegations that he referred to a staff member as the “token Muslim”, imitated people of Chinese descent and remarked that one individual was attractive for a black woman. Hester apologised for the remarks about Abbott in March, while maintaining that they were not to do with race. All the new allegations were put to Hester this week. He did not respond to the claims. On Friday, Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, challenged Tory candidates to take a stand against Hester’s money. In her letter, she said: “Back then the suggestion was that Frank Hester’s words, saying that Diane Abbott made him want to hate all black women, were a one-off and that his other comments – about ‘the Indians’ among his staff, or the ‘Asian corner’ – were misconstrued.” She said the Guardian’s fresh allegations revealed Hester had a history of making unacceptable remarks “year after year”, such as referring to a staff member as “tinged” and subjecting staff to impressions of Chinese people as well as saying one person was attractive for a black woman. “Rishi Sunak and Richard Holden may not care about this,” she said. “They were happy to take thousands of pounds from Hester just days after the first allegations broke and they have been happy to make the Conservative election campaign overwhelmingly reliant on his donations. But if they will not return that money in light of these latest revelations, then you have a decision to make. Will you do the right thing and stand up to them?” Dodds told the candidates that if they did not, “every leaflet you fold and every social media advert you post makes you personally reliant on the money” of a donor with a record of allegedly making racist remarks. It was confirmed on Thursday that Hester had donated an additional £5m to the Conservatives this year, as well as a further £150,000 after the party was aware of his remarks about Abbott. His £15m of donations in total equate to about 40% of the overall £34m limit on national spending during the year before an election. The Lib Dems called on Friday for the Conservatives to donate the latest £5m given by Hester to a veterans’ charity. Richard Foord, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesperson, said: “Yesterday it emerged that the Conservative party accepted another £5m from Frank Hester, a man who has made the most appalling racist and misogynistic comments. Rishi Sunak must personally ensure this money is donated instead to a veterans’ charity as an apology for his absence [at a D-day ceremony] yesterday. It’s the least that our veterans and service personnel deserve.” The Conservative party did not directly address questions about what due diligence, if any, it had carried out on Hester before accepting further donations from him. A spokesperson said: “Mr Hester has rightly apologised for comments made in the past. Mr Hester has apologised and shown contrition and we consider the matter resolved. The Conservative party is funded by membership, fundraising and donations. All reportable donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law. Indeed, such observations can be made about who our donors are, precisely because our donations are transparently published. “Fundraising is a legitimate part of the democratic process. The alternative is taxpayer funding of political campaigning, which would mean less money for frontline services like schools and hospitals – or being in the pocket of the trade unions, like the Labour party.”",

It said its 2023 full-year accounts would now include an €12m exceptional charge with respect to onerous apple contracts, which was originally due to be recorded in the 2024 accounts, adding that the total value of the underlying and exceptional adjustments was €17m. C&amp;C said: “The group’s chief executive officer, Patrick McMahon, was chief financial officer during the periods to which these adjustments relate and acknowledges that the relevant shortcomings occurred at a time when he had overall responsibility for the group’s finance function. “Accordingly, he has informed the board that he will step down as CEO and as a director with immediate effect.” Ralph Findlay, the company’s chair, has become chief executive and is expected to remain in post for 12-18 months while a new boss is recruited. Detailed internal and external reviews were launched after discrepancies were reported to C&amp;C’s audit committee this year and an independent accounting firm was appointed to investigate. C&amp;C said: “In addition to accounting mistakes and errors of judgment underlying these [historical] issues, it is clear from the reviews undertaken that there were failures in the group’s reporting framework and that in parts of the organisation behaviours fell short of the levels of transparency demanded and required such that opportunities were missed to identify and appropriately address the relevant issues.” The company, which is the largest drinks distributor to the UK and Irish hospitality sectors, also said the troubled installation of an upgraded enterprise resource planning IT software system in its Bibendum and Matthew Clark businesses had continued to weigh on its UK performance. The company reported losses of €111m in the financial year ended February 2024 against pre-tax profits of €52m in the previous year.",

        "title": "‘Greed’: John Deere rolls out hundreds of US layoffs and sends work to Mexico",
        "content": "US workers at John Deere plants have accused the company of acting on “greed” as America’s most famous agricultural equipment company plans to shift more production to Mexico. The company – famous for its green tractors and leaping deer logo – has announced layoffs of several hundred workers over the last several months with more layoffs planned for later this year. “We get wind of more layoffs daily, it seems, and it’s causing uncertainty all over,” said a longtime John Deere worker at the Harvester Works plant in East Moline, Illinois, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “The only reason for Deere to do this is greed.” They cited the company’s recent profits. John Deere reported a profit of over $10bn in fiscal year 2023 and its CEO John May received $26.7m in total compensation. John Deere spent over $7.2bn on stock buybacks in 2023 and provided shareholders with more than $1.4bn in dividends. The worker said: “Our harvester plant is still in production and management has been quiet. They’re not doing the normal ‘time to talk’ meetings as they have in recent past. My belief is that they don’t want people to know they are losing their jobs until they get everything built for the year. “We know a layoff is coming, we don’t know if, how many or when it will happen. We’re expecting to finish production in mid-August and believe we will see a large layoff then.” In October last year, John Deere announced 250 indefinite layoffs at the Illinois plant. Another 34 workers were laid off in May. Earlier this year, at least 650 jobs were cut at John Deere’s plants in Iowa, with 500 jobs cut in Waterloo and 150 jobs cut at the Ankeny plant. Another 103 workers took an early retirement offer at the Ottumwa plant after the company announced plans to cut more jobs at the plant later this year and shift that production to Mexico. Chris Laursen, 53, is one of the employees at the Ottumwa plant who took the early retirement, citing concerns about being laid off given he was terminated last year but through his union won his job back. He had worked there for 22 years. Laursen said: “[For] a lot of these communities, like mine in Ottumwa, losing John Deere would be an extremely big loss. It’s a town of 28,000, and the only other manufacturing is a pork processing facility, so it doesn’t leave a lot of options for jobs. “A multinational corporation like Deere sees Mexico as pretty attractive for a cheap labor source: they can import steel cheaper there and bring it across the border and sell it to the majority of their market in the US. It’s a sign of the times, perpetuating what’s been going on with the loss of manufacturing here in America, good union jobs and otherwise.” KWWL News 7, a local NBC News affiliate in Iowa, reported that John Deere sent out an email to workers stating plans of further layoffs in the third quarter of this year, but the number of layoffs were not provided. Deere announced plans to move production of skid steer loaders and compact track loaders from a Dubuque plant to Mexico by late 2026. In 2022, the company had announced plans to move cab production from Iowa to Mexico, impacting 250 employees. John Deere stated its 2023 annual report that it employs 33,800 workers in the US and Canada. The layoffs come in the wake of a strike of more than 10,000 workers represented by the United Auto Workers at 14 John Deere plants in Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Colorado and Georgia in October 2021. The strike led headlines during ‘Striketober’ – a month of large scale industrial actions around the US. The John Deere strike ended in November that year when workers ratified a new six-year union contract agreement. John Deere did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",

        "title": "Not guilty: how tech mogul Mike Lynch’s fortunes soared, fell – and rose again",
        "content": "“This is a momentous day in Autonomy’s history,” Mike Lynch declared in a press release on 18 August 2011. He was announcing the sale Autonomy, his software firm, to Hewlett-Packard for $11bn. For Lynch 6 June 2024 would prove more significant. After a saga spanning almost 13 years, Lynch – once dubbed “Britain’s Bill Gates” – was cleared of fraud following a lengthy trial in the heart of Silicon Valley. The verdict amounts to a stunning reversal in fortunes for the entrepreneur. On Thursday, Lynch said he was “elated” to have been found not guilty. “The truth has finally prevailed,” his lawyers declared. He now plans to fly home to the UK, where he still faces a fight to clear his name. HP largely won a civil lawsuit against Lynch and Sushovan Hussain, another top autonomy executive, in London two years ago. The company is seeking $4bn in damages. Lynch has previously indicated he plans to appeal the ruling. By all accounts, the takeover was disastrous. Just five weeks after it was announced, the HP CEO who signed off on the deal was sacked. Lynch departed Autonomy after less than a year. The lucrative takeover had fleetingly cemented Lynch’s reputation as one of Britain’s most successful tech tycoons. Its real legacy was more than a decade of acrimonious legal wrangling. In November 2012, HP’s new management wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8bn, alleging “serious” accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and “outright misrepresentations” before the purchase. After years of investigations and legal proceedings on both sides of the Atlantic, a US federal grand jury indicted Lynch on criminal charges in November 2018. After the civil case concluded, the UK agreed to extradite him. His legal problems mounted last year. Having largely lost the UK civil lawsuit, Lynch lost a UK high court bid to appeal his extradition. Weeks later, he was on a plane to California. This San Francisco trial, on more than a dozen counts of fraud, amounted to a steep climb for Lynch, who unsuccessfully fought to avoid extradition to the US. Federal prosecutors have a fearsome record of guilty verdicts, and Lynch’s lawyers were forced to adjust their defense ahead of the trial. From the start of this saga, Lynch insisted Autonomy’s unravelling was the result of HP’s mismanagement of a prized asset rather than fraud. But the US district judge presiding over the trial, Charles Breyer, barred Lynch’s lawyers from presenting evidence which they said made this case. Unable to focus on the aftermath of the takeover, Lynch’s defense was built upon on three key arguments: first, that running a business like Autonomy is far more complicated than prosecutors would have the jury believe; second, that Lynch was a far different man to the character he had been portrayed as; and third, that HP rushed to seal the deal, racing through due diligence. The government’s case was “black and white”, Reid Weingarten, one of Lynch’s attorneys, declared in the opening days of the trial. “And you know what? You’re going to see in this trial that ain’t the way the world works. The world works in grey. The world is complicated.” Life is “nuanced, and it is messy”, Lynch told the court, suggesting his trial was effectively “peering through the door and seeing the sausage being made. One thing to bear in mind is if you take the microscope into a spotless kitchen, you will always find bacteria. And I don’t think Autonomy is any different.” Prosecutors tried to paint Lynch as an intimidating, ruthless businessman who was responsible for every facet of Autonomy’s empire. Jurors heard about the piranha tank in the atrium of the company’s headquarters, and meeting rooms named after James Bond villains. Lynch found it “surreal” to hear government witnesses testify about many discussions and decisions of which he said he had not been aware. He said he delegated jobs where he had no expertise, and in his latter years at Autonomy spent “about 30%” of his time with family and on other interests. “We believe the better you know him, the better off we are,” Weingarten told the jury, before Lynch testified. Prosecutors said Lynch had “500m reasons” to commit fraud – one for each of the pounds they claimed he had earned the HP’s takeover of Autonomy. But the company had wanted to remain independent, according to Lynch. It was one of the stars of London’s FTSE 100 share index, and still pursuing its own acquisitions. By Lynch’s telling, it was only a meeting with an HP executive at a luxury house in the English countryside which persuaded him to start considering a deal – and a 64% premium on Autonomy’s stock price that ultimately prompted the company to accept. HP was so determined to expeditiously transform itself from hardware manufacturer to software giant, Lynch claimed, that the first time he saw the press release announcing its takeover of his company was when it was released. The process was a “complete mess”, he reflected on the stand. The prosecution argued HP’s handling of the process was irrelevant. For years, they alleged, Lynch had orchestrated a huge fraud and Autonomy had used a variety of accounting tricks to inflate its sales growth. But Lynch stressed that HP was “not at all” misled about Autonomy’s value. A jury of Californians believed him, rejecting the case laid out in great detail by the US government, which summoned more than 30 witnesses. Six years ago, in the same court, a jury came to a different conclusion about one of Lynch’s closest business partners. Hussain, who worked as Autonomy’s chief financial officer, was convicted in 2018 on charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud related to the deal. He was released from a US prison in January after serving a five-year sentence. Lynch, who at the height of his career was awarded an OBE (Order of the British Empire) and advised the UK prime minister, spent much of the year before his trial monitored by two armed guards around the clock, under effective house arrest. The specter of more than two decades in prison, were he convicted, loomed large. On Thursday, the businessman left court a free man. “I am looking forward to returning to the UK and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field,” he said. Another momentous day.",

        "title": "BAT subsidiary lobbies Pakistan to allow export of cigarettes to Sudan",
        "content": "A subsidiary of British American Tobacco is lobbying the government of Pakistan to allow it to export 10-packs of cigarettes to war-torn Sudan, prompting criticism from a smoking campaign group. Pakistan is among more than 80 countries that do not permit the sale or manufacture of 10-packs of cigarettes, which the World Health Organization has said make smoking more affordable for children. But BAT’s subsidiary, Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC), has written to the government’s health ministry to lobby for a change in the law that would allow it to make smaller packs there, for export to Sudan and other countries where they are not prohibited. In a leaked letter seen by the Guardian, PTC said it had “received a new export order to manufacture for Sudan, which includes packs of 10 cigarettes”. PTC said that Sudan, which is in the grip of a civil war that is estimated to have claimed as many as 150,000 lives, does not ban the sale of 10-packs. The company told the Islamabad government that changing the law would “benefit Pakistan” because the order was worth $20.5m and could be repeated, bringing valuable dollar currency reserves into Pakistan. It asked for the law to be “amended” to allow it to manufacture smaller cigarette packets for export. Mark Hurley, vice-president at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CTFK), said smaller packs were particularly likely to appeal to under-18s. “It is beyond shameful that British American Tobacco is seeking to alter the law in Pakistan so that it can flood an African country in crisis with cheap cigarettes,” he said. He said more than 80 countries around the world had enacted laws requiring a minimum of 20 cigarettes a pack “because evidence shows these cheap packs are used to target kids and vulnerable populations”. “Exploiting not only this knowledge but a country facing a humanitarian crisis is the behaviour of a company that will truly stop at nothing to sell and addict more people to cigarettes.” More than 180 countries, including Pakistan and Sudan, are signatories to the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which obliges them to prohibit the sale of cigarettes individually or in small packets which increase the affordability of such products to minors. While the FCTC does not define what constitutes a small pack, at least 82 countries have enacted laws requiring a minimum of 20 sticks a pack. London-based BAT, which makes brands including Lucky Strike and Rothmans, said the export order was intended to replace domestic manufacturing by its Sudanese subsidiary, Blue Nile Cigarette Company (BNCC). The subsidiary’s factory is based in Madani, which has been the scene of heavy fighting in Sudan’s bloody civil war. A BAT spokesperson said: “To ensure the continuity of products to meet consumer demands in Sudan, which predominantly operates in cigarette packs of 10, Pakistan was given the export order to supply to BNCC. “The clearance for the export order of cigarette packs of 10 from Pakistan to Sudan is pending regulatory approval by the government of Pakistan. The clearance complies with all local laws and regulations in Sudan. “For any products manufactured by BAT, we abide by strict marketing principles to prevent marketing and sales to underage [consumers]. These measures include prominent 18+ age warnings on packaging as well as our communications.” A spokesperson for the Pakistan government declined to comment. In 2017, a Guardian investigation uncovered how BAT promoted sales of its cigarettes in some of the most fragile, war-torn and unstable countries of Africa and the Middle East. At the time, a spokesperson said: “We take our commitment to the responsible marketing of our products very seriously. “We have strict, company-wide marketing principles in place to ensure that our products are marketed responsibly, in addition to adhering to all relevant laws and regulations in the 200 markets where we operate.”",

        "title": "Royal Mail bidders, paradise islands and Prague properties: questions asked over Daniel Křetínský’s business links",
        "content": "On Prague’s exclusive Pařížská Street sits a nondescript brown door. Lodged between a designer clothing shop and a luxury luggage store, it is the gateway into a discreet sixth-floor office from where one of the Czech Republic’s richest people runs his empire. There is nothing overly ostentatious about the entrance, but inside, the office screams wealth: papers relating to the billionaire’s latest deals are mingled among numerous pieces of impressionist art, some of which is simply sitting on the floor. This is the world of Daniel Křetínský, the multibillionaire Czech tycoon bidding to buy the UK’s Royal Mail, who is perhaps best known for what he owns, rather than the work he does. His collection of recognisable assets include stakes in big supermarkets such as Sainsbury’s in the UK and France’s Casino; trophy media brands including France’s Elle magazine; and holdings in two top-flight European football clubs, West Ham United and Sparta Prague. There is the obligatory luxury property portfolio, too: a Paris mansion and a £65m house in London, once reportedly rented to the pop star Justin Bieber. Yet those possessions are prizes from his unfashionable investments in the energy sector, where Křetínský has chased profits – rather than green credentials – by acquiring discounted fossil-fuel businesses as their previous owners race towards net zero. In a rare public speech in 2015, Křetínský said: “We want to make money in industries that are dying because we think they’ll die much more slowly than the general consensus says.” His approach has prompted environmentalists to call him a “fossil hyena”. Yet while the spotlight has fallen on Křetínský, as he vies to take over the UK’s venerable and vulnerable postal service, much less attention has been paid to the quiet business partners with whom his fortunes are inextricably tied – and their involvement in controversial property deals stretching from the Czech Republic to the Turks and Caicos Islands. “He is a clean skin,” says one close observer, suggesting that behind the vanilla billionaire leading the bid to acquire a 500-year-old British institution are partners with less sterile business styles. “That is not to say that he doesn’t have autonomy and I imagine that he is a very smart individual.” Křetínský’s connections Křetínský – the son of a computing professor and a senior judge – studied political science and law at Masaryk University in Brno, before beginning his rise as a lawyer at an investment company called J&amp;T Finance Group. The company was founded in Slovakia in 1993 – the year the country became independent after the 1989 Velvet Revolution that led to the end of communism and the former Czechoslovakia. It was the creation of “former schoolmates Patrik Tkáč and Ivan Jakabovič”, according to a 2008 article in the Slovak Spectator, which added: “From the beginning, they had relatively easy access to capital and contacts, as Tkáč ’s father Jozef was head of the IRB state bank”. In the only book ever written on Křetínský, Mister K, the writer Jérôme Lefilliâtre records: “[Patrik] Tkáč works on intuition, on emotion, on impulse, but it’s not perfect when you need to get into the details of operations. Křetínský, as a lawyer, has this. That’s why he became so important at J&amp;T.” That precise eye led to his rise to become a J&amp;T equity partner – which in turn placed him at the centre of a 2009 deal when the firm spun off its energy and industrial assets into a new company called EPH. EPH owns a series of coal plants and gas assets – including a pipeline sending Russian gas to central and eastern Europe plus a UK company that was fined £23.63m last year after the regulator Ofgem concluded it had gamed the energy market. It has more than 25,000 employees across Europe. J&amp;T retained a 40% stake in the spin-off, while another 40% stake was taken by a Czech investment firm called PPF Group and Petr Kellner, who was the Czech Republic’s richest man until his death in a helicopter accident in March 2021. Křetínský, who managed the new standalone business and held a 20% share, is the long-term partner of Anna Kellnerová, Kellner’s daughter. More than a decade later, Křetínský is the inscrutable figurehead for a sprawling €50bn (£43bn) empire. His EP Group is the main shareholder in EPH – part of an empire based around seven holding companies that own stakes in energy, logistics, sports, media and retailing businesses, according to an organisational chart supplied to the Guardian by the billionaire’s advisers. The chart further sets out how – with the exception of the group that owns shares in West Ham and Sparta Prague – all the holding companies are at least 44% owned by “J&amp;T related investors inc P Tkac”. That structure will be mirrored if Křetínský eventually acquires the Royal Mail’s parent, International Distribution Services (IDS). It seems odd, then, that all the Royal Mail focus has centred on a man so enigmatic he is dubbed the “Czech Sphinx”. This looks doubly strange as, if Křetínský is the epitome of smooth, Tkáč and J&amp;T seemingly possess slightly rougher edges. Paradise islands The territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands lies in the Atlantic Ocean, about 200 miles off the east coast of Cuba, and is one of 14 UK overseas territories. It consists of 40 islands and cays, covering about 190 sq miles, including the tiny Salt Cay in the south-east. It was there that an apparently parochial luxury hotel and golf course development project led to the UK government imposing rule from London in 2009 – on the back of corruption allegations against the former premier Michael Misick. One of the allegations against Misick involved claims he helped a Slovak billionaire gain privileged access to buy and then develop crown land. The businessman, Mario Hoffmann, was a close associate of Tkáč and J&amp;T who personally introduced Misick to J&amp;T’s bank, J&amp;T Banka. The bank then supplied the premier with millions of dollars in personal loans. Misick has always denied any wrongdoing and is expected to have the chance to clear his name in a long-awaited trial – which might provoke some unease in Prague and Bratislava considering Tkáč’s and Křetínský’s ties to the group at the time. A hearing could consider a $6m loan received by Misick from J&amp;T Banka in 2007, which was given “on advantageous terms from the overseas backers (J&amp;T) of a development project on Salt Cay”, according to Robin Auld’s subsequent 2009 commission of inquiry report into the scandal. The report continued: “The collateral on the loan was the 50% share in the Salt Cay Golf Club Ltd agreed by Mr Mario Hoffmann [with] a company controlled by the Hon Michael Misick’s brother, Chal Misick, following the grant of development permission promoted by the Hon Michael Misick himself.” Auld went on to suggest that the transaction was part of “a pattern” of a “relative or close friend receiving a large unearned stake in a development company”. It is not clear if Misick repaid J&amp;T’s $6m. But consider what might have happened if the premier had defaulted. In that scenario, J&amp;T and Hoffmann could have taken ownership of a company that had suddenly become valuable after the actions of the Turks and Caicos premier. Simultaneously, that same premier would have been left with $6m in the bank. J&amp;T claimed it never intended to own the golf company – and had seen nothing wrong with the transactions. “Given the [politically exposed person] status of Mr Misick, the credit line had been scrutinised from that perspective and no wrongdoings had been identified at that time,” it said. In his report, Auld disagreed. In recommending a criminal investigation, the judge wrote: “I find that there is information of possibly corrupt and/or otherwise seriously dishonest involvement, including misfeasance in public office, of the Hon Michael Misick in relation to the government’s transactions with Mario Hoffmann.” He said this included “potential abuse of his public office by seeking and accepting a loan of $6m from J&amp;T Banka when that bank, on its own account, was in negotiation with the government over funding and participation in the development of Salt Cay”. J&amp;T denied to the Guardian it had been directly negotiating with the Turks and Caicos government about the funding, but there was very little effort to distance itself from the detail in Auld’s report when the scandal broke. Hoffmann’s close association with the bank continued for years and when he parted company with J&amp;T in 2015, Tkáč announced: “I respect Mario Hoffmann both professionally and personally. After several years of good cooperation, we have thus agreed on the division and settlement of joint activities in J&amp;T. We will cooperate with each other on the Alzheimer’s disease research project.” Hoffmann and Misick did not respond to efforts to contact them. Defendant in New York lawsuit While J&amp;T’s ties to Hoffmann raise questions about the bank’s judgment in the 2000s, there is a second legal claim involving more recent allegations concerning the Royal Mail bidder’s dealings, which could attract the UK government’s attention as it assesses the takeover’s national security considerations. J&amp;T was a named defendant in a case filed in New York during 2019 alleging that another Czech billionaire, Radovan Vítek – plus his Frankfurt-listed company CPI Property Group (CPI PG) – “perpetrated a massive scheme to defraud his business partners”, including an investment business, Investhold. The scheme – in which Vitek allegedly stripped out the partnership’s “most valuable assets … for his own personal enrichment” – was made possible by “J&amp;T Banka … and its affiliates”, the court papers alleged, with the bank financing “nearly every one of Vitek’s fraudulent schemes, and was a willing participant in Vitek’s crimes”. Tkáč is described in the complaint as being one of Vitek’s “close friends”, and a judge ruled New York was the incorrect jurisdiction to hear the claim, leaving similar cases to run in Cyprus and Luxembourg. A spokesperson for Vitek and CPI PG said the New York claim was “based on false allegations” and filed with the “purpose of inflicting maximum reputational damage to CPI PG”. The spokesperson added Vitek and the company believed all the claims were “completely baseless”. Muddy Waters highlights Czech deal Meanwhile, a report published in January by Muddy Waters Research, a US investment firm that conducts investigations on public companies, raised additional questions by highlighting J&amp;T’s involvement in a multimillion-euro CPI property transaction in the Czech Republic. The report named J&amp;T as a Vitek “proxy” after, in 2014, he appeared to acquire from CPI two property companies that owned plots of Prague land. Three years later, Vitek sold the undeveloped land back to CPI at a considerable profit. The Muddy Waters report stated: “The [2014] consideration was €14.2m. In 2017, Vitek completed the roundtrip, selling the [holding companies] back to CPI PG for €50.9m. Vitek’s profit on the roundtrip was €30.9m, even though neither parcel of land had undergone any development.” A spokesperson for Vitek and CPI PG denied that the “roundtrip” had been devised to reward Vitek with more than €30m and said: “The assets had improved in the intervening years due to obtaining building permits for about 1,000 apartments. Since the acquisition in 2017, CPI PG has made a significant profit on the properties and expects to monetise further profits.” A spokesperson for J&amp;T added: “We would like to emphasise that the [Turks and Caicos and CPI PG] cases you are referring to involve accusations of wrongdoing of clients with whom we had banking relationships not wrongdoing carried out by our group.” Křetínský’s spokesperson said: “EP Group has recently received clearances from the relevant authorities in France, Germany and the UK to own or invest in nationally important businesses. This includes a review in 2022 under the UK’s National Security and Investment Act, which found no reason why EP Group, through its Vesa Equity Investment vehicle, should not be allowed to increase its stake in IDS to more than 25%. “In addition, EP Group issues publicly traded bonds which requires international banks and investors to conduct annual ‘know your customer’ (KYC) checks on EP Group and J&amp;T Capital Partners. These banks and investors have always been comfortable with the parties, the shareholding structure and the ultimate beneficial owners.” If it has not already, the UK government may want to ask these due diligence questions about the Křetínský-Tkáč-J&amp;T bid for Royal Mail, all over again.",

        "title": "Great British Energy will be welcome – but Labour risks over-selling it",
        "content": "Great British Energy, Labour’s proposed publicly owned energy company, scores well with voters, according to the pollsters, and one can understand why. The promise to invest in “cheap, clean, homegrown energy, to cut bills for families and rebuild the strength of British industry” ticks every imaginable box. What’s not to like? And, since the privatised utilities are never going to win a popularity contest (especially when the boss of British Gas’s owner is being paid £8m), the publicly-owned structure of GB Energy is almost a cherry on top. Other countries have state-owned firms making good profits in the UK energy market. Now the home side will be on the pitch. Yet Labour would be wise to temper expectations about what GB Energy can achieve, and when. Keir Starmer’s claim this week that the operation will be “taking control of our energy supply to bring down bills” requires several gigawatts-worth of context. Energy is a very large and long-term business and you do not work miracles with £8.3bn, the sum earmarked for GB Energy over the course of the next parliament. Look at what the existing players will be investing in the same period. National Grid intends to spend £30bn in the UK over the next five years, SSE is on course for £20.5bn in the five years to 2027 and Scottish Power’s plan is £12bn between now and 2028. GB Energy may be able to use debt to leverage its £8.3bn into a bigger sum (it’s not currently clear), but it’s a stretch and a half to say it will have a controlling role in energy supply. On bills, Labour should equally be careful. As National Grid et al crank up spending, it’s nailed-on that the “network costs” element of our energy bills will increase – that is how energy infrastructure is paid for. Eventually, we trust, there will come a cross-over point when more electricity from wind, solar and nuclear sources reduces costs for consumers, but it probably won’t be reached during the life of the next parliament. In any case, the outcome will be dictated for a while yet by the price of natural gas. None of which is to suggest that GB Energy is pointless. The part of the mission that deserves a full-throated cheer is the focus on local projects, where £3.3bn of the £8.3bn will be allocated to back small solar and onshore wind projects by lending to local authorities, and so on. That ought to be uncontentious: there are numerous examples, from Germany and Norway, of successful municipal networks and the big players aren’t interested in the fiddly stuff. Similarly, there’s a fair argument that a state-owned operator can hurry up the development of new technologies, such as floating offshore wind, by reducing the cost of capital in high-risk projects. But, in terms of bills, do not expect quick wins. It took a couple of decades of support from the contracts-for-difference mechanism to take chunks out of the costs of conventional offshore windfarms. GB Energy, then, on its current iteration, looks a nice-to-have supplement. It should be able to fill gaps in the market and be a co-investor in riskier projects. But £8.3bn – or £1.7bn a year – is not gamechanging money when a single high-voltage subsea and underground cable to bring electricity from Aberdeenshire to North Yorkshire can cost £3.4bn. If an incoming Labour government achieves its ambitious target of decarbonising the power grid by 2030, it won’t be because GB Energy has ridden to the rescue. Rather, it will be because ministers have succeeded in clearing the planning obstacles that litter the system. That remains the big job.",

        "title": "Incoming ministers ‘will face UK public services on brink of collapse’",
        "content": "Political parties must be honest with Britain about the immediate crisis of collapsing public services facing the next government, according to a hard-hitting report that lays bare the crisis affecting the NHS, criminal justice system, prisons and local government. In a direct challenge to Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer to come clean with voters, the Institute for Government thinktank said most state services are performing worse than at the time of the 2019 general election, and “substantially worse” than when the Conservatives first took office in 2010. The IfG said it was not plausible for the victorious party on 4 July to stick to current spending plans at a time when the performance of hospitals was arguably the worst in the history of the NHS, prisons were at crisis point, and councils were shutting libraries and cutting back on waste collection and social care. Warning that few incoming administrations had faced challenges on such a scale and of such severity, the thinktank called on the Conservatives and Labour to provide a “credible vision” for dealing with problems that had worsened since Boris Johnson won his landslide victory in December 2019. The election campaign has been dominated this week by the row over Sunak’s claim that Labour would need to raise taxes by £2,000 to fund its spending pledges. Both main parties are relying heavily on a growing economy to provide extra revenues to boost public spending, although Labour has said it will raise more money through taxes on private school fees, scrapping the non-dom tax status of wealthy foreign nationals in the UK and by a stiffer windfall tax on energy companies. Friday’s report from the IfG, titled The Precarious State of the State, said the reality was that growth had stagnated in recent years, living standards had fallen over the course of the 2019-24 parliament, tax and spending levels were already at a historically high level and plans for post-election public spending were implausible. Emma Norris, the IfG’s deputy director, said: “Few newly elected prime ministers will have had to take on such a long and painful list of problems. Many will require immediate attention, not least to rescue services on the brink of collapse. Almost all – from stagnant growth to a fragile civil service – will require serious reform over the next parliament and beyond.” The bleak analysis came as the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank warned that more councils were likely to go bust if the next government stuck to existing spending plans, and the Local Government Association revised upwards its estimate of English councils’ funding gap over the next two years (the difference between resources and demand) from £4bn to £6bn. On Thursday the rating agency Moody said the near-term outlook for the next UK government was for a sluggish economy and stretched public finances. Earlier this week the Resolution Foundation thinktank said the next government would need to fill a shortfall of £33bn in the public finances unless it was prepared to embark on a fresh round of austerity measures. Both Labour and Conservatives pledged to cut public debt as a share of national income within five years, a commitment the independent Office for Budget Responsibility says can only be met by sticking to post-election plans for the public finances that involve a 1% real terms increase in day-to-day public spending. With some areas of public spending ringfenced – such as the NHS, defence and overseas aid – sticking to the 1% target would require deep cuts in unprotected departments, such as the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice. “Spending plans from April 2025 onwards for public services are very tight”, the IfG said. “Sticking to these – given existing commitments to fund the NHS workforce plan, increase defence spending, maintain overseas aid and expand free childcare – implies other areas of spending being cut by 2.6% a year in real-terms between 2024/25 and 2028/29.” The IfG warned that the proposed tough spending plans came at a time when: NHS waiting times had been the longest on record, and targets for elective care, A&amp;E and cancer treatment have not been met since 2016. The number of people waiting for more than 12 hours in A&amp;E has tripled to 1.5m since 2019. People are struggling to see their doctor, despite more appointments being delivered than ever. The numbers of patients per GP had risen by 18% since 2015. Prisons were at a crisis point. Capacity would be used up shortly after the election, resulting in further early releases of prisoners and delayed court cases. Even so, funding was set to fall by 5.9% each year relative to demand in the next parliament. In the last six years, there had been six times the number of section 114 (“bankruptcy”) noticed filed by local authorities than in the previous three decades, forcing cuts to key services. Residents in those areas face rising council tax bills and vastly reduced services such as libraries, waste collection and adult and children’s social care. “Current spending plans are implausible”, the IfG report said. “They assume further cuts to a criminal justice system that is on its knees, minimal change in schools or local government, and only small increases in a health service which has suffered a decade of insufficient funding.” Historic underinvestment in capital meant public services were often short of critical equipment like CT scanners or forced to rely on outdated technology. Maintenance backlogs across schools, hospitals, prisons, criminal courts and the road network had also grown substantially and now totalled £37bn. “All of this makes it harder for staff to do their jobs, reducing the productivity and performance of public services”, the IfG said. The report singled out school performance in England as the key area in which England had seen improvement, in absolute terms and relative to international comparators.",

        "title": "Tech tycoon Mike Lynch cleared of all fraud charges in Hewlett-Packard trial",
        "content": "The British tech tycoon Mike Lynch was found not guilty on Thursday on all 15 counts of fraud he faced over the $11.1bn purchase of his company Autonomy by Hewlett-Packard in 2011. Lynch’s trial began in March in San Francisco after a lengthy battle over his extradition from England to the US. He was first charged in 2018, accused of inflating sales, misleading regulators and duping his eventual buyer. HP wrote down the entire value of his company by billions of dollars soon after the deal closed, alleging it discovered major accounting improprieties. Lynch went on trial charged with 16 counts of wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy, but the securities fraud charge was dropped. “I am elated with today’s verdict and grateful to the jury for their attention to the facts over the last 10 weeks,” Lynch said on Thursday. “My deepest thanks go to my legal team for their tireless work on my behalf. I am looking forward to returning to the UK and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field.” Lynch himself testified as the final witness in the trial before jury deliberations. The entrepreneur has maintained his innocence throughout the proceedings, proclaiming that the company he founded and led was not fraudulent even as he admitted it was “not perfect”. The former CEO claimed he had little knowledge of the company’s day-to-day business dealings, or its accounting practices, as his own background was more technical. He foisted blame for accounting irregularities – the source of HP’s claims of fraud after the deal had been completed – on other executives and the company’s employees. He said he often delegated tasks. For their part, prosecutors called Lynch the “driving force” at the helm of a years-long fraud, laying blame squarely at his feet as the CEO. They called more than 30 people to the stand, whom Lynch described as “a parade of witnesses I’ve never met”. Many had difficulty recounting specific conversations or recalling decisions made nearly a decade and a half ago. The central claim by the US government against Autonomy involved the company’s alleged concealment of its sales of hardware. The company marketed itself as a software company but allegedly often sold both hardware and software as a package so as to artificially boost sales. Prosecutors allege Lynch “paid customers to buy software” as a means of ginning up millions in fraudulent revenue. On Thursday, Lynch’s attorneys Christopher Morvillo and Brian Heberlig declared that the jury had delivered a “resounding rejection” of the government’s “profound overreach” in this case. “The evidence presented at trial demonstrated conclusively that Mike Lynch is innocent,” Morvillo and Heberlig said. “This verdict closes the book on a relentless 13-year effort to pin HP’s well-documented ineptitude on Dr Lynch. Thankfully, the truth has finally prevailed.” A spokesman for the office of the United States attorney said: “We acknowledge and respect the verdict.” Lynch was at one time heralded as a great success of the British technology industry, earning an Order of the British Empire medal in 2006 and elections as a fellow to both the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society in 2008 and 2014, respectively.",

        "title": "Watchdog ends investigation into description of UK economy ‘going gangbusters’",
        "content": "The UK’s statistics watchdog has closed an investigation into remarks made by an official about the economy “going gangbusters” that were cited by Rishi Sunak. It was looking into the comments made by chief economist of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) last month amid concerns that politicians could misuse economic data in the run-up to the election. Grant Fitzner used the phrase in a briefing with journalists on 10 May after figures showed the UK was officially out of recession and that the economy grew by 0.6% in the first three months of the year and became the basis of a Daily Mail front page story the following day. A week later Sunak, in an interview on the Radio 4 Today programme, repeated the words, telling listeners: “The facts are the facts. You had, I think, the person from the Office for National Statistics talking about the economic growth that the country produced in the first quarter of the year. He said what he said about that and I think he used the term ‘gangbusters’, so I will leave it at that.” The UK Statistics Authority, chaired by Sir Robert Chote, said on Tuesday that it was investigating the remarks. However, the case was examined by a different watchdog, the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), which looked only at the ONS use of the term and not Sunak’s. The OSR reported on Thursday that it had closed the case, but did not provide any further information on its findings, beyond referring the Guardian to a statement from the ONS, which said: “The use of the word ‘gangbusters’ was a passing reference used when our chief economist was discussing the first quarter’s economic growth with journalists at our press briefing on release day. “The reference was made – paraphrasing a remark by a former Australian prime minister – as [first quarter] growth had come in stronger than commentators expected, with broad-based growth across services and manufacturing industries, and with quarterly growth at its strongest pace since the pandemic. “It was certainly not intended as a comment about the overall state of the economy and when the comment was made it was immediately clarified to those present that this was not a word that the ONS would use to describe the first quarter’s growth. We also put the comment in context for journalists who followed up afterwards.” Dario Perkins, a senior economist at the consultancy TS Lombard and former Treasury official, said it was unwise for the ONS to say the economy was growing quickly and wrong for the prime minister to use one quarter of GDP growth to argue that economic health had been restored. “The ONS is not supposed to use these kinds of descriptive words to tell a story about the economy. And it is also wrong to say the economy is booming in the first three months of the year when we have only just recovered lost growth from last year’s recession and suffered the worst incomes squeeze in a generation.” The OSR intervention came hours after Chote began a review of Sunak’s claim in Tuesday night’s leaders debate that independent civil servants calculated that Labour would raise taxes by £2,000 for everyone should it win the election on 4 July. Labour has complained that the figure was wrong and was erroneously described as independently verified by Treasury civil servants. On Tuesday, hours before the TV debate between Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer, Chote wrote to the main political parties and top civil servants to warn them about “ensuring the appropriate and transparent use of statistics”. Chote previously ran the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, and was the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, a leading arbiter of government tax and spending policies. On Thursday, the UK Statistics Authority said the £2,000 claim failed an “intelligent transparency” test and was misleading. It warned all parties to refrain from making exaggerated or misleading claims about tax and spending policies. • This article was updated on 6 June 2024 to replace an earlier version that carried the headline: “UK statistics watchdog to investigate Sunak’s use of term ‘economy going gangbusters’”. The investigation by the UK Statistics Authority concerned remarks made by an ONS official during a briefing with journalists, not the repetition of those remarks by Rishi Sunak, as the previous version stated. This investigation was not personally carried out by Sir Robert Chote but, as the updated version makes clear, by the Office for Statistics Regulation.",

        "title": "Ex-BT boss pockets £3.7m final pay deal as group plans to axe 55,000 jobs",
        "content": "BT’s former chief executive Philip Jansen has been awarded his largest pay and bonus package, a £3.7m reward for the same year in which he announced plans to cut 55,000 jobs at the telecoms company by 2030. The pay deal for Jansen, who was nicknamed Food Bank Phil after the company set up a “community pantry” for call centre staff struggling to make ends meet, was revealed in BT’s latest annual report. The sum includes a £2.6m bonus for hitting targets linked to profit and cashflow, taking Jansen’s total earnings over five years at the company to £16.8m. Jansen joined BT in 2019 after reportedly making £50m from the stock market float of payments processing firm Worldpay. Under his stewardship, BT focused much of its efforts on rolling out fast fibre broadband, however the company’s share price also halved during his tenure. He left the top job at the London-based telecoms company in January this year after announcing his intention to step down in 2023. He remains employed as an adviser until the end of this month. Thousands of staff are also due to leave BT after Jansen announced sweeping job cuts in May 2023, during the same financial year covered by his latest pay award. BT said it would become a “leaner business”, reducing its workforce by up to 55,000 by 2030, more than 40% of its global employee base, including about 10,000 jobs replaced by artificial intelligence. Jansen said at the time that a “big chunk” of the job cuts would be in the UK, where the company is headquartered. “Philip’s pay last year was not affected by the stated plan to reduce the total number of BT employees over the next seven years,” a company spokesperson said. BT employs about 130,000 staff globally, with approximately 30,000 of those contractors through third parties, and has about 80,000 staff in the UK. In 2022, the company was embroiled in a labour dispute with staff over pay, including a series of strikes, during which the Communication Workers Union (CWU) coined the nickname Food Bank Phil. The name related to claims that BT set up a food bank at a call centre in North Tyneside. BT said it was a “community pantry” for shift workers with no time to go to the shops. In May last year, BT said it intended to reduce its total workforce to about 75,000-90,000 between 2028 and 2030. Last month BT disclosed a further £3bn of cost-cutting measures, saying it had peak investment in the rollout of its UK full-fibre broadband network. The company also raised the dividend it pays to investors. Jansen’s successor as chief executive, Allison Kirkby, has said she will continue with his cost-cutting plans, with the job reduction target unchanged. A spokesperson said: “Philip’s basic salary stayed flat between the time he joined BT in 2019 and standing down as chief executive earlier this year – but his overall remuneration last financial year was higher, due to stronger performance outcomes against our bonus measures, as well as the fact that two tranches of his long-term share awards vested in [2024]. “A significant proportion of the chief executive’s remuneration is delivered through long-term incentives, where awards are linked to share price movements over the longer term.”",

        "title": "New Frank Hester race claims pile pressure on Tories over £15m donations",
        "content": "The Conservative party is facing questions over its decision to keep more than £15m given by its biggest ever donor, Frank Hester, after former employees made a series of fresh allegations. Hester is alleged to have referred to a staff member as the “token Muslim”, imitated people of Chinese descent and remarked that one individual was attractive for a black woman, according to former employees who spoke to the Guardian. More than a dozen former staffers told the Guardian of claims that Hester repeatedly made comments about race or religion in the workplace or on a work trip, including in recent years. The claims will pile pressure on Rishi Sunak after it was confirmed on Thursday that Hester had given a further £5m to the Tories through his healthcare tech company, the Phoenix Partnership (TPP). It brings the total donated by Hester to more than £15m in a year, equating to more than 40% of the total national spending limit for each party in the general election. All the allegations were put to Hester. He did not respond to the claims. In relation to the new claims, a Conservative spokesperson said the party considered the matter “resolved” as Hester had previously apologised for past remarks about Diane Abbott, which were widely condemned as racist and misogynistic. Earlier this year, Sunak resisted calls to return the £10m Hester and his firm initially donated, with one of his ministers saying the 2019 comments were made “half a decade ago”. But in the past six months, former TPP staff have spoken to the Guardian about Hester’s alleged workplace behaviour over a number of years. Two ex-employees described Hester talking about an individual at a hotel in 2021 and saying she was attractive for a black woman. The comment was allegedly made during a work trip in London. Other former workers claimed Hester would use a Chinese accent and squint his eyes to narrow them in order to imitate people of Chinese heritage while at TPP’s headquarters in Leeds. “He was going on a trip to China and he would pull his eyes and say, ‘when are we next going to China?’ in front of Chinese colleagues. You felt like you couldn’t say anything,” one former staffer claimed. Another individual who worked between 2019 and 2020 at TPP, which holds multimillion-pound technology contracts with the NHS and Department of Health, alleged: “I heard Frank on several occasions use a mocking Chinese accent when saying certain phrases or repeating something an Asian colleague had said. “It felt humiliating to be so obviously othered in front of a large group. This was behaviour I might have expected in a 70s school playground, not from the CEO of a high-value company at the heart of the NHS.” Another ex-employee said: “I worked at TPP for about a year and on several occasions Frank would imitate a racist caricature of Chinese people, complete with an exaggerated accent, squinted eyes and a toothy grin.” Five ex-employees also alleged Hester referred repeatedly to one worker as the “token Muslim” for several years up to around 2016, owing to him being one of the only Muslims who worked at TPP at the time. One claimed: “He’d often talked about someone in the company being like the token Muslim,”, and another former worker alleged: “There was a ‘token Muslim’ … he was the nicest guy in the world. He would have taken it as a joke. Not that that makes it right.” Three former workers spoke of Hester having asked for “brown” people to go on a work trip to India in late 2013 to early 2014. “He was going on a trade mission to India. And he came into the room and said he didn’t have enough ‘brown faces’ to take with him. So can all the brown faces please volunteer,” an ex-staffer claimed. Another former employee alleged that in late 2013 they were assigned by Hester to work in India because of their ethnic background. They said Hester told them they had been picked “because you are a bit … tinged”. They claimed that in early 2014, Hester said a new colleague had been hired because “he’s black but he looks more Indian. So we all know what project he’ll be going on.” The former employee said they felt that “it was clear that Frank was aligning people to projects based solely on skin colour”. In March, the Guardian reported that Hester had told colleagues that seeing Abbott, Britain’s longest-standing black MP, on TV made “you want to hate all black women”. He later apologised for making “rude” remarks but denied they were motivated by race or gender, saying he “abhorred racism”. The revelation led to cross-party calls for Sunak to return £10m in donations from Hester, which had been made public at that time. West Yorkshire police launched an investigation into “racist comments which were allegedly made at a meeting” by Hester, after it received a complaint from Abbott. The force confirmed this week the inquiry was ongoing. Reports of a further £5m donation emerged later in March. Data released on Thursday confirmed Hester had given a further £5m through TPP in January this year, and that the Conservative party accepted another £150,000 from TPP three days after the Guardian revealed Hester’s remarks about Abbott. Abbott said news that the Conservatives had accepted another £5m from Hester was “an insult” to her “and all black women”. The Guardian previously reported that in 2019 Hester called all his “foreign” workers together to defend himself against online claims that he had made racist remarks. During this meeting, he said he abhorred racism and told his team their progress would not be “based on the colour of your skin, your ethnicity, where your parents are from”. However, he also said: “We take the piss out of the fact that all our Chinese girls sit together in Asian corner.” During the same, crowded meeting at TPP’s Leeds headquarters, he asked if there was “no room for the Indians” and suggested staff climb on a train roof, before adding that he made “a lot of jokes about racism, about our different creeds and cultures. But I just want to assure you that it is just the most abhorrent thing.” Hester gave his own definition of racism at the meeting, saying: “For me, racism is just a hatred and a fear of the other. For me, it is just exactly the same as homophobia – it’s not limited to the colour of your skin, it is not limited to religion, it can just be the country next door, it can just be the county next door. It can be northerners and southerners, which we have here.” Equality campaigners criticised Sunak’s failure to return Hester’s donations at the time, saying an “increasingly normalised culture of racism … has been allowed to fester” under the government. The Operation Black Vote leader, Simon Woolley, as well as the Runnymede Trust and the Muslim Council of Britain were among those to sign a letter saying: “The donation of £10m to the Conservative party by Mr Hester and his company … becomes a matter of ethical concern and raises questions about the integrity and values that the party wishes to uphold.” In response to the fresh allegations, Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, said it showed Hester had a “historical record” of making unacceptable comments. “Rishi Sunak had the chance to cut ties with Frank Hester months ago, but instead accepted further donations from a man who is under investigation from the police for racist remarks. He even told the House of Commons he was pleased to receive Frank Hester’s support. “Sunak must return the money and get a grip on the extreme views which appear to be tolerated within his party.” The Conservative party did not directly address questions about what due diligence, if any, it carried out into Hester before accepting further donations from him. A spokesperson said: “Mr Hester has rightly apologised for comments made in the past. Mr Hester has apologised and shown contrition and we consider the matter resolved. “The Conservative party is funded by membership, fundraising and donations. All reportable donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law. Indeed, such observations can be made about who our donors are, precisely because our donations are transparently published. “Fundraising is a legitimate part of the democratic process. The alternative is taxpayer funding of political campaigning, which would mean less money for frontline services like schools and hospitals – or being in the pocket of the trade unions, like the Labour party.”",

        "title": "Four charts that prove the huge financial pressure many Australian households are under",
        "content": "Australians appear financially resilient, according to many of the major indicators, with indebted households finding creative ways to manage budgets. But just under the surface there are signs of financial stress everywhere, raising questions over how long people can hang on in an environment of elevated interest rates and high living costs. Here are four charts that show the strains many people are under. More businesses collapsing as spending falls Australia’s major lenders recently reported modest levels of loan defaults and home repossessions, prompting upbeat commentary about the plight of households. But late loan repayments are a lagging indicator and “one of the last places where financial stress manifests”, according to rating agency Standard &amp; Poor’s, which means arrears figures can hide the extent of the financial pain many households are under right now. Peter Swan, professor of banking and finance at the University of NSW, said that more forward-looking data suggested households were already under significant strain, resulting in a sharp decrease in spending that was rattling consumer-facing businesses such as cafes and restaurants. Data from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission shows that Australia is on track to record decade-high numbers of collapsed businesses by the end of the financial year, led by the building and food services sectors. Accommodation and food services businesses are collapsing at more than double the rate than they were two years ago, according to Asic. “I should think there is certainly a lot of pressure at the moment in terms of reductions in discretionary expenditure,” Swan said. “People aren’t eating out as much and having one course, not three. They’re not buying luxurious wines with dinner and so on.” Rising inequality Growing angst about generational wealth inequality is linked to the rise in asset prices enjoyed by older households that has left younger cohorts behind, according to AMP. The financial firm notes this is mostly the result of good luck due to a decades-long decline in interest rates that has lifted equities and home prices. Younger generations now also face a chronic housing shortage. “High wealth inequality is an issue because if it dampens living standards across generations it can cause resentment and social instability,” Diana Mousina, AMP’s deputy chief economist, said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Financial data cited by AMP shows that people aged 55 and over are increasing their spending and savings in a cost-of-living crisis. Those who own homes, debt free, tend to benefit from the current economic cycle given they receive higher deposit rates. In contrast, savings levels are being depleted for younger generations even as they cut their spending, which is difficult to do when prices for essentials, including food, housing and utilities, are rising. Affluent stress More than a third of Australians who earn six figures are living paycheque to paycheque, with less than a month’s worth of their salary saved, according to Finder. Sarah Megginson, Finder’s personal finance spokesperson, said even relatively well-off Australian households were now under significant financial pressure. “Australians have taken extreme measures to reduce their expenses, yet they still have very little left over at the end of the month,” she said. “There’s little wriggle room even for double-income households, with six figures barely enough to cover housing, food and everyday bills.” Historically, financial distress has been triggered by a major event such as a health issue or job loss. Now, elevated interest rates and a relentless rise in living costs are forcing relatively affluent Australians to take drastic measures, such as selling the family home. About 40% of those surveyed by Finder with a household income of more than $100,000 said they could not live off their savings for more than one month. Debt struggles Almost half of Australian adults with debt, the equivalent of 5.8 million people, are struggling to make repayments, according to research released by the corporate regulator. Many of those same people say they would not seek hardship assistance from their bank or lender due in part to “emotional barriers” such as feeling ashamed or embarrassed. Some indebted households choose to sell assets or find additional work to make repayments, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission found. “It is concerning that people would rather sell their personal belongings or get a second job rather than seek financial hardship assistance,” the Asic commissioner, Alan Kirkland, said. “Customers in hardship are entitled under the law to request assistance.” Lenders are required to consider altering loan obligations, such as deferring payments, after receiving a hardship request. Almost all of those surveyed who experienced financial hardship experienced negative side effects, including stress or anxiety, loss of sleep or a decline in physical health or appearance, according to the regulator.",

        "title": "‘Strong likelihood’ ECB is in dialling back phase, says Lagarde, after first rate cut since 2019 – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up…. here are today’s main stories: Over in the US, meanwhile, layoffs remain low. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless support rose last week, to a four-week high of 229,000. That’s higher than the 219,000 which economists expected, but is still a historically low figure really. Konstantin Veit, portfolio manager at PIMCO, also expects two more interest rate cuts this year – in three, and six, month’s time. Veir says: The European Central Bank (ECB) cut policy rates by 25 basis points, without providing firm guidance beyond June. While the ECB has lowered its cruising altitude somewhat, the data flow over the coming months will decide the speed at which the ECB removes additional restrictiveness. Given the ECB’s reaction function, we envision the ECB to keep cutting rates at staff projection meetings. September provides the next opportunity to holistically reassess the disinflation process. Contrary to earlier this year, market pricing seems reasonable and broadly in line with our long-held baseline of three cuts for this year. We expect additional cuts in September and December. Risks are skewed towards less cuts, mainly on the back of sticky services inflation, a resilient labour market, loose financial conditions and ECB risk management considerations. Today’s eurozone interest rate cut is “one of the best-telegraphed moves in monetary policy history,” says Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. That’s a reference to the hints from policymakers in recent weeks that a cut at the June meeting was a done deal (as it proved). Brzeski predicts that two more rate cuts this year are likely, but cautions that the ECB could be deterred by “negative inflation surprises”. He says: The stickiness of inflation has clearly made some ECB members more cautious and reluctant than a few months ago. In an ideal world, in which the eurozone economy does exactly what the ECB macro forecasts expect it to do, namely to grow at potential with inflation slightly below 2%, the ECB will eventually continue with cutting rates. One rate cut in September and another one in December are the most likely outcomes. However, it wouldn’t take a lot of negative inflation surprises for the ECB to tread more carefully or even reverse today’s cut. With today’s decision, the ECB has slightly loosened the monetary policy breaks. With more (inflation) roadblocks ahead, it’s clearly far too early to even think about taking the foot off the breaks entirely. Christine Lagarde was right, it didn’t take long to discover which ECB policymaker voted against today’s interest rate cut. The lone opponent was Robert Holzmann, the current Governor of Austria’s central bank, Reuters reports, citing three sources. Q: French president Emmanual Macron has proposed extending the ECB’s mandate to cover economic growth and climate protection. What’s your view? Christine Lagarde does not sound keen on this Élysée Palace wheeze. Lagarde explains that the ECB has a clear mandate already – delivering price stability. That gives ‘solid guideposts and boundaries’ for monetary policy strategy. The ECB doesn’t see the need, or have the capacity or competence, to change that. She adds that providing price stability can encourage investment in green technologies and infrastructure. Q: What is your view about the ECB publishing dot plots (as the Federal Reserve uses to show where policymakers expect interest rates to be in future). Lagarde says the dot-plot mechanism is “an interesting concept”, but says no more. And wishing the assembled reporters a “good summer”, that’s the end of the press conference. Q: How divided is the ECB’s governing council about the path ahead, and aas today’s decision unanimous? Christine Lagarde reveals that the decision was not unanimous, and that one member of the governing council opposed it. She explains: Was it a unanimous decision? Yes, but for one governor. She doesn’t disclose who, but later says it shouldn’t be hard for reporters to identify “him”. Lagarde adds that everyone on the governing council was united that the path was data dependent, and decisions would be taken meeting by meeting. There was “absolutely no dissent on that”, she says. Christine Lagarde then explains that there are ‘bumps on the road’ on the journey to get inflation down to the ECB’s 2% target. Some are predictable (such as base effects, where an inflation change a year ago affects the rate today), but others can come as a surprise. Lagarde says: The next few months will continue to be bumpy, we know that. Q: Has the ECB entered into a ‘dialling back’ phase, or could today’s cut be ‘one and done’? Christine Lagarde says she “won’t volunteer” that the ECB is moving into a dialling back phase today. Decisions are being made based on the ECB’s confidence about the path for inflation, but it needs to see data, and analysis of that data, to confirm the eurozone is on that path, she explains: As Lagarde puts it, with a wave of her hand (like an umpire signalling a four): I cannot confirm that it is the dialling process that is underway. There is a strong likelihood, but it will be data-dependent. Onto questions! Q: Can you explain why you have cut interest rates while also raising your inflation forecasts – did you precommit to a cut today too early? Lagarde tries to fend off this bouncer, by explaining that the ECB’s governing council started today’s meeting by paying tribute to those who died on the beaches of Normandy 80 years ago today. Those sacrifices on D-day allowed Europe to build what we have build since, Lagarde (a former French finance minister) explains. That’s why there can be “very harmonious and congenial decisions” among 20 nationals representing their national central banks. Then, we decided to cut, she declares. And it did that, because the ECB’s “confidence in the path ahead” has been increasing in the past months. She reminds reporters that the ECB tightened policy rapidly between July 2022 and September 2023. Then it entered a holding phase, until today. In each of those two phases, inflation halved, she explains. Lagarde explains that the ECB is data-dependent, and will make decisions meeting by meeting. Q: The market expects 65 basis points of cuts this year – is the market right? [that would imply nearly two more cuts on top of today’s 25 basis points reduction] Markets do what they have to do, she replies. And the ECB will do what it has to do, too. Extreme weather events, and the broader climate crisis, could push up food prices and add to inflation, Christine Lagarde explains: The risks facing economic growth are balanced in the near term, but remain tilted to the downtide in the medium term, Lagarde cautions. If there is a weaker world economy, or an escalation in trade tensions between major economies, would weigh on the eurozone economy, she warns. Russia’s war against Ukraine, and the conflict in the Middle East, are both threats to growth, she adds. But growth could be higher, if inflation falls faster than expected. On inflation, Lagarde reminds us that prices rose by 2.6% in the year to May, up from 2.4% in April. But, she says, food and goods inflation fell, while energy prices rose and services inflation rose markedly. Despite that, most measures of underlying inflation fell. But “domestic inflation remains high”, Lagarde warns, while wages are still rising at an elevated pace as earnings catch up with the previous surge in inflation. Looking ahead, there are signs that wage growth will moderate, she adds. Lagarde then outlines how the eurozone economy is showing some signs of resilience. After five quarters of stagnation, the eurozone grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2024, she tells reporters. The services sector is expanding, while manufacturing is showing signs of stabilisation at a low level, Lagarde points out. The ECB expects the economy to continue to recover, as higher wages and improved terms of trade push up real incomes, she adds. ECB president Christine Lagarde then reads out that the ECB is “determined” to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner, and will keep policy rates “sufficiently restrictive” for as long as necessary to achieve this. And she says slowly, and clearly: We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. ECB president Christine Lagarde is holding a press conference in Frannkfurt now, to discuss today’s interest rates decision. Lagarde begins by confirming that the ECB’s governing council lowered its three key interest rates by a quarter of one percentage point. She’s now reading out the statement released 30 minutes ago (you can read it here). Here’s the key section: Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady. Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly. Underlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons. Monetary policy has kept financing conditions restrictive. By dampening demand and keeping inflation expectations well anchored, this has made a major contribution to bringing inflation back down. At the same time, despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year. She then adds that the ECB has revised up its inflation forecasts for 2024 and 2025, as covered earlier. The European Central Bank has eased the pressure on borrowers across the eurozone after cutting its main interest rate for the first time in almost five years. The ECB reduced its deposit rate to 3.75% from a record high of 4%, putting it ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have yet to cut interest rates. Financial markets eagerly anticipated the first eurozone cut since September 2019, which will also affect the ECB’s main refinancing operations rate, which fell from 4.5% to 4.25%. City analysts had forecast the cut in borrowing costs at the ECB’s June meeting after signals that that the central bank was ready to offer more support to eurozone economies after a period of economic stagnation following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. More here. The ECB has “put money where its mouth” is by delivering a first rate cut in this cycle, says Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG: “As was widely expected, the ECB has become one of the first major central banks to cut interest rates this year. Despite some improvement in sentiment, sluggish economic activity since the start of 2023, coupled with broadly balanced inflationary pressures, was enough to convince the Governing Council to ease monetary policy. Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, says today’s rate cut will provide relief to consumers and businesses on the continent: “The starting gun has been fired and the European Central Bank is the first out of the major three banks to start cutting rates. This is a significant move given it is the first rate cut from the ECB in five years, and ends what has been one of the most aggressive and swift rate hiking cycles in modern times. “Importantly, this is not likely to be a single cut and done for a while, with signals suggesting a further cut or two are on the horizon this year as inflation has subsided. The ECB has stolen a march on the Bank of England and Federal Reserve – who are both potentially still a few months away from cutting – and will breathe life into an economy that desperately needs some form of stimulus. But….Mark Wall, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank, says the ECB isn’t in a rush to ease policy further: “As expected, the ECB cut rates 25bp. But the statement arguably gave less guidance than might have been expected on what comes next. In that sense, the immediate tone is a “hawkish cut”. This is not a central bank in a rush to ease policy.” The European Central Bank has also raised its forecasts for inflation this year and next, although this didn’t deter policymakers from cutting interest rates today. The ECB’s staff now forecast headline inflation will average 2.5% in 2024, and then drop to 2.2% in 2025. Three months ago, inflation had been forecast to average 2.3% in 2024, before dropping to the ECB’s 2% target in 2025. Policymakers still expect inflation to drop to 1.9% in 2026. The ECB has also raised its forecast for core inflation in 2024 and 2025. Today’s rate cut was widely expected – and investors are looking for hints as to when The European Central Bank might lower rate cuts further. On that point, the ECB’s governing council says it is not “pre-committing” to a particular path of interest rates. Instead, future decisions will depend on the outlook for inflation. In May, inflation rose to 2.6% from 2.4% in April, away from the ECB’s 2% target, but lower than a year ago when it was over 6%. The ECB says: The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path. The ECB has slashed its three key interest rates by a quarter of one percentage point today, in its first rate cuts since before the Covid-19 pandemic. In a statement just released, the ECB explains: The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady. This makes the ECB the first of the Big Three central banks to cut interest rates in the current cycle, and follows cuts by Canada yesterday, Sweden in May and Switzerland in March. This takes the ECB’s deposit rate down to 3.75%, from the record high of 4% where it has been pegged since last September. The deposit rate was last cut in 2019, before the ECB began raising interest rates in 2022 and 2023 to fight inflation. The ECB has also lowered the interest rate on the main refinancing operations, which is the rate banks pay when they borrow money from the ECB for one week, from 4.5% to 4.25. Its third key interest rate, the marginal lending facility, has been lowered from 4.75% to 4.5%. This means the ECB has cut interest rates ahead of the US Federal Reserve, which is keeping US interest rates at a 23-year high, and the Bank of England, whose Bank rate is a 16-year high. The European Central Bank has cut interest rates across the eurozone, for the first time in nearly five years. Excitement is building in the European financial markets, ahead of the European Central Bank interest rate decision in 15 minutes. Economists and traders are united in expecting a cut to borrowing costs today. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, says today is “all about the ECB”: The fact that ECB members have been telegraphing their expectations of a June rate cut over recent weeks does make today’s decision look like a done deal, with the focus likely to be geared towards the outlook for the rest of the year. The main question for markets rest around the pace of easing this year, with significant indecision over whether we see two or three rate cuts by year-end. With that in mind, markets are likely to be more sensitive to any changes in Lagarde’s tone, alongside inflation and growth forecasts. While we have grown accustomed to the data dependent approach taken by the major central banks, we will be on the lookout for whether Lagarde views this as the beginning of a wider easing phase or simply normalizing rates somewhat after a dramatic period of hikes that took rates to a record high in a bid to combat inflation. The next UK government will face a sluggish economy and stretched public finances in the near term, credit rating agency Moody’s has warned. In a new report, Moody’s Ratings says that whoever wins next month’s general election will be hampered by weak growth and a high debt burden, which will restrict their policy ambitions. It explains that high levels of inactivity, and stubbornly high service sector inflation, will beset the economy even as the energy crisis eases. And the economic cost of Brexit will be ‘little changed’, even if relations with the EU are smoothed, leading to more certainty and higher investment. Moody’s says: “A high debt burden will hamper the next government’s policy ambitions, regardless of who wins, limiting the election’s impact on the UK’s credit profile. Over the next five-year term, further improvements to EU co-operation would support the investment environment, higher than expected migration can boost labour supply and reforms to planning regulations, which do not entail a fiscal cost, could unlock housing and infrastructure investment. However, the UK’s labour participation challenges, fiscal constraints and weaknesses in policy effectiveness may persist, hampering efforts to overcome deep-seated economic difficulties.” The report also warns that the fiscal strategy outlined in March’s budget, showing large real-term spending cuts for some departments, will be “difficult to implement”. But, it also warns that further significant tax rises will also be “politically difficult”. Last night, the Conservative Party promised not to hike property taxes if it won the next election. Labour, who have accused Rishi Sunak of lying after claiming their spending plans would cause taxes to rise by £2,094, are under pressure from some shadow ministers to raise capital gains tax in an autumn budget. Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia face increased antitrust scrutiny of their roles in the artificial intelligence industry after a report that US regulators have reached an agreement on investigating the companies. The New York Times reported that the US justice department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have reached an agreement on investigations into the main protagonists in the AI market. The deal is expected to be completed in the coming days, according to the report. The justice department will lead on investigating whether Nvidia, the leading maker of chips that train and operate AI systems, has broken antitrust laws that oversee fair competition in business and aim to prevent monopolies, said the NYT on Wednesday. The risk of blackouts in Great Britain will be lower this winter thanks to more gas-fired power and a new power cable linking the UK to Denmark, according to National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO). Kayte O’Neill, the ESO’s chief operating officer, said the group’s initial assessment of the winter ahead suggests that the country will have “sufficient margins” of electricity supplies relative to demand. O’Neill says: “Factors such as increased interconnector capacity, new gas generation, growth in battery storage capacity and increased generation connected to the distribution networks are contributing to higher margins than last winter.” National Grid launched the Viking Link power cable earlier this year after it first began importing electricity from Denmark in December. The FTSE 100 company is expected to spin off the ESO later this summer to become an independent public body. ESO’s early view of the winter ahead includes a supply margin of 5.6 GW, or 9.4%, compared with a margin of 4.4 GW, or 7.4%, which they predicted ahead of last winter. In its review of the last winter it said that actual margins were “broadly within the expected range” but did not provide a figure. The Construction PMI report has included encouraging signs that UK inflation pressures are easing. Building firms reported that lead times (the wait to obtain raw materials) fell to the shortest in severn months. So with supply-chain conditions improving, companies reported only a small increase in input costs last month – with prices rising at the slowest rate in five months. Construction firms also signalled a marked improvement in the availability of sub-contractors, while prices charged by sub-contractors slowed, but still “increased solidly”. Michael Wynne, director of the sustainable housebuilder Q New Homes, has hailed this morning’s news that UK construction growth strengthened last month. Wynne declares: “Housebuilding is finally coming out of the deep freeze. While it’s still lagging behind the rest of the construction industry, residential building has inched back into growth territory. “But this is still a thaw rather than a rebound. After months of contraction, housebuilding output is only expanding slowly. “Nevertheless the mood among housebuilders is improving, as the headwinds that held back our industry for so long begin to ease. “Building cost inflation – which wiped out many smaller players’ profit margins during the dark days of 2023 – continues to soften. UK companies are planning to raise wages at a slower pace this year – which will cheer the Bank of England (BoE), but depress workers. The BoE’s latest ‘Decision Maker Panel’ (DMP) survey, just released, shows that companies expect wage growth to be 4.5% in the year ahead. Annual wage growth was 6.0% in the three months to May, so this shows that firms expect their wage growth to decline by 1.5 percentage points over the next 12 months. The BoE has cited wage growth as a key factor determining how soon it can cut UK interest rates. The DMP polls chief financial officers from small, medium and large UK businesses. It also found that: Businesses expect their output price inflation to decline over the next year. Year-ahead own-price inflation was expected to be 3.9% in the three months to May, down from 4.0% in the three months to April. Firms reported annual employment growth of 1.5% in the three months to May, lower than the 1.7% reported in the three months to April. Firms reported that the average interest rate that they were paying on their borrowing (both bank and market based) was 6.6% in May, 0.4 percentage points lower than reported in April. Back in the eurozone, retail sales have weakened, suggesting that consumer spending remains subdued despite recent falls in inflation. Retail sales volumes (how much people bought in the shops) fell by 0.5% across the eurozone in April compared with March, and was 0.6% lower in the European Union. That largely reverses a 0.7% rise in retail sales across the eurozone in March. On an annual basis, sales volumes were flat compared with April 2023, and 0.1% lower in the EU. Barry Goodall, partner and head of construction at independent law firm Brabners, agrees that the UK construction sector is strengthening: “A third consecutive month of growth adds to the belief that the construction sector has turned a corner as economic conditions continue to improve. “While it remains a ‘watch’ industry for insolvencies, the many contractual challenges we saw arise amid the period of rampant inflation have begun to ease and firms are planning ahead with greater certainty around input costs and interest rates. “If the latter fall as anticipated, we can expect a relatively positive second half to the year with demand also likely to be boosted by the momentum provided by an early General Election.” Today’s construction PMI report shows the sector is on a more stable footing heading into the key summer months, reports Brian Smith, head of cost management at AECOM: “There is further room for optimism as well. An early General Election reduces the risk of market inertia and will almost certainly embolden decision-making in the second half of the year. With the rate of inflation reducing back to normal levels, the prospect of falling interest rates should also breathe much-needed wind into the sails of housebuilders. “That said, contractors will be hopeful of more concrete commitments to infrastructure investment within party manifestos before planning too far beyond the end of 2024.” This chart shows how housebuilding activity returned to growth (over 50-points on the PMI scale) last month, after a long contraction: Newsflash: Britain’s construction sector grew at the fastest pace in two years last month. Data firm S&amp;P Global has reported that growth in the UK construction sector gained momentum during May, with activity and new business increasing at sharper rates than in April. Building firms reported rising workloads, which spurred them into buying more materials and taking on more staff. This has pushed S&amp;P’s construction PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, up to 54.7 from 53.0 in April. That shows the fastest increase in activity since May 2022. The sharpest increase in activity was seen in the commercial construction category, while civil engineering grew at a slightly softer pace. Housebuilding only rose slightlly, though. This is the first time since May 2022 that all three monitored categories saw an increase in activity. Andrew Harker, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says the construction sector appears to be building good momentum. Harker adds: Particularly pleasing was the broad-based nature of the rise in activity as work on housing projects increased for the first time in more than a year-and-a-half. “Firms are gearing up for further growth in the months ahead, posting renewed expansions in both employment and purchasing activity as workloads increase. Moreover, the supply-chain environment continued to improve in May. Companies were able to secure inputs much more quickly than in April and at prices that were only slightly higher than in the previous month on average. These factors should help constructors in their efforts to ramp up operations in line with greater new order inflows.” The London stock market is joining this morning’s rally, with the blue-chip FTSE 100 index up 0.3%, and the smaller FTSE 250 index gaining 0.4%. John Wood Group, the engineering and consultancy business, are the top riser on the FTSe 250 – up 10% after agreeding to discuss a sweetened takeover proposal from Dubai-based rival Sidara. European stock markets are rallying this morning, as traders anticipate a cut to eurozone interest rates at lunchtime. Germany’s DAX index has gained 0.8% in early trading, while France’s CAC is 0.3% higher, and both Spain’s IBEX and Italy’s FTSE MIB are up 0.15%. Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: There’s renewed optimism that the ECB will cut interest rates in its decision later today, which is adding additional enthusiasm into equities. The lingering question, however, is what the interest rate roadmap looks like after June. Even if a cut arrives today, markets will be more interested in understanding expectations for the rest of the year. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has upgraded its expectations of UK economic growth for this year and 2025 – but the new forecasts can hardly be called ‘gangbusters’. The BCC says the economy has made a stronger start to this year than expected. So growth for 2024 and 2025 has been revised upwards to 0.8% and 1.0% respectively. However, 2026’s growth forecast is unchanged, at 1.0%, with the BCC warning that “a poor outlook for exports” is dragging on growth, while high interest rates continue to limit investment. Vicky Pryce, who chairs the BCC economic advisory council, said: “The BCC’s latest forecast shows there is life in the UK economy but if it is to gain momentum then it must be nurtured. “With interest rates expected to be cut at a modest pace and pay outstripping inflation, businesses will be holding onto much of their money – even as confidence rises after the mini-recession. “As we enter the final weeks of the general election campaign, businesses will be watching for politicians to show they have sustainable long term economic plans. “These must play to the UK’s strengths and give companies confidence.” The UK’s statistics watchdog has opened an investigation into remarks made by Rishi Sunak about the economy “going gangbusters” amid concerns that politicians could misuse economic data in the run-up to the election. Sir Robert Chote, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, will examine whether the prime minister repeated comments that were “taken out of context” and exaggerated the Conservative party’s economic record. The phrase “going gangbusters” was used by an official at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) during a briefing about the economy with journalists before becoming the basis of a Daily Mail front page story last month. A week later Sunak, in an interview on the Radio 4 Today programme, repeated the term. More here…. Back in the eurozone, German factories have suffered another drop in orders. German industrial orders dropped by 0.2% in April, missing expectations of a rise of 0.6%. That’s the fourth monthly drop in a row. It indicates that manufacturing in Europe’s largest economy hasn’t made a strong start to 2024; perhaps a cut to interest rates might help… The decline was due to a drop in large-scale orders in April. That included a 15.4% decline in demand for ‘other transport equipment’ such as aircraft, ships, trains. There was aso a 5.1% drop in the manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products, while electrical equipment orders fell 4.1%, and the manufacture of machinery and equipment dropped by 1.5%. In a third AI development this morning, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Microsoft deliberately structured a takeover deal to avoid a government antitrust review. The transaction in question involved AI startup Inflection. In March, Microsoft announced an unusual licening deal in which it paid $650m to use Inflections models and hired most of its staff, including its co-founders. The FTC is concerned that this allowed Microsoft to swerve a rule that acquisitions valued at more than $119m must be reported to to federal antitrust-enforcement agencies, who could choose to investigate the impact on competition. The WSJ says: The FTC is now drilling down on Microsoft’s deal with Inflection, seeking information about how and why they negotiated their partnership, according to a person familiar with the matter and records viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Civil subpoenas the commission sent recently to Microsoft and Inflection seek documents going back about two years. The agency is trying to determine whether Microsoft crafted a deal that would give it control of Inflection but also dodge FTC review of the transaction, the person said. If the agency finds that Microsoft should have reported and sought government review of its deal with Inflection, the FTC could bring an enforcement action against Microsoft. Officials could ask a court to fine Microsoft and suspend the transaction while the FTC conducts a full-scale investigation of the deal’s impact on competition. More here: FTC Opens Antitrust Probe of Microsoft AI Deal UK authorities are also interested in the deal. In April, the Competitions and Markets Authority announced an investigation into Microsoft’s “hiring of certain former employees of Inflection AI” and “its entry into associated arrangements with Inflection AI”…. Elsewhere this morning, the top US antitrust enforcer has pledged to look “with urgency” at the artificial intelligence sector. Jonathan Kanter has told the Financial Times about his concerns that power over the transformative technology is being concentrated among a few deep-pocketed players. Kantar cited “monopoly choke points and the competitive landscape” in AI, such as thecomputing power and the data used to train large language models, to cloud service providers, engineering talent and access to essential hardware such as graphics processing unit chips (where Nvidia has such power). The FT explains: Regulators are concerned that the nascent AI sector is “at the high-water mark of competition, not the floor” and must act “with urgency” to ensure that already dominant tech companies do not control the market, Kanter said. Sometimes the most meaningful intervention is when the intervention is in real time,” he added. “The beauty of that is you can be less invasive.” Some of the biggest players in the artificial intelligence field are facing the prospect of an antitrust investigation. US regulators have cleared the way for antitrust inquiries into Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI, according to reports this morning, as they intensify their scrutiny of AI. The New York Times reports that the US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have reached a deal to split responsibility for investigating the three major players in AI. Once completed, probably in the coming days, the deal will mean the DoJ will take the lead investigating Nvidia, whose chips are driving the AI revolution, and whose market capitalisation hit $3trn last night. This leaves the FTC with the task of examining OpenAI, maker of the ChatGPT chatbot, which has received billions of dollars of investment and support from Microsoft, which owns 49% of its shares. Nvidia, OpenAI and Microsoft are in the spotligh due to concerns over their dominance of the AI space, and worries that. artificial intelligence will cost millions of jobs, and that safety oversight within the industry is weak. The move shows that the AI industry faces growing regulatory scrutiny. Back in January, the FTC launched an inquiry on Thursday into investments and partnerships made by some of the biggest companies in the generative artificial intelligence space. Just last week, US antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter told a conference that there are structures and trends in AI that should give us pause’”. Kanter, the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division at the Department of Justice, explained: AI relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already-dominant firms a substantial advantage. Powerful network effects may enable dominant firms to control these new markets, and existing power in the digital economy may create a powerful incentive to control emerging innovations that will not only impact our economy, but the health and well-being of our society and free expression. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The European Central Bank is poised to join a select group today, by lowering borrowing costs across the eurozone. Following heavy hints in recent weeks, economists widely agree that the ECB will vote to lower its key interest rates at a governing council meeting in Frankfurt today. A cut makes sense, as inflation across the eurozone has cooled this year – to 2.6% in May. It would start to unwind a tightening cycle that began in summer 2022, and which has pushed the ECB’s deposit rate to a record high. The decision comes at 1.15pm UK time; the money markets this morning show that a rate cut is a 92% probability, with just 8% chance of no change. If that’s accurate, the ECB would join Sweden and Switzerland, who lowered their interest rates in recent months, and Canada, which yesterday became the first G7 country to cut rates in this cycle. It would mean, unusually, the ECB easing policy before the US Federal Reserve. Economists and traders are also looking for hints as to how quickly the ECB might continue to ease policy in the coming months. Inflation actually rose in May, up from 2.4% in April, which has created some uncertainty over whether underlying price pressures have been subdued. Henk Potts, market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, commented: “After nine months of keeping rates on hold, we expect the European Central Bank to embark on a rate-cutting cycle at its meeting on Thursday, 6 June. A quarter-point reduction across its policy rates, the first cut since 2019, is anticipated. Our view is that the Governing Council’s rationale will likely be driven by a stronger-than-expected recovery in activity and increased confidence that inflation will return to the targeted level. Beyond the June meeting, we forecast that we could see quarter-point cuts in September and December. In addition, we expect to see 75 basis points of cuts next year, with the deposit rate finishing 2025 at 2.5%.” Analysts at Deutsche Bank told clients that the question is, “what comes after June?”, adding: The cut will set the new direction for policy but with economic momentum outperforming expectations and domestic inflation proving sticky in 2024, the ECB can afford to take things slowly and let the data set the parameters of the easing cycle.

        "title": "Officials considered sacking Paula Vennells as Post Office boss in 2014 ",
        "content": "UK government officials expressed serious doubts about Paula Vennells’ suitability as the chief executive of the Post Office and considered sacking her in 2014, five years before she resigned, the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal has heard. According to internal government documents shown at the inquiry on Thursday, officials and other Post Office board members had concerns about Vennells’ leadership a decade ago. “Advice from the recent annual review suggested that the POL [Post Office Ltd] team give careful consideration to the continued suitability of Paula Vennells as CEO,” read one document, dated February 2014. It appeared to be from the Post Office’s risk and assurance committee, with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the sole shareholder in the state-owned company, and the Shareholder Executive, which managed the government’s relationship with the Post Office and was made up of senior industry people, appearing at the top of the page. “There is a general consensus that Paula is no longer the right person to lead POL but justification is anecdotal.” In a section entitled “Why is Paula’s position under review?”, one of the reasons given was that “she has been unable to work with personalities that provide robust challenge to her”. The inquiry is examining how the state-owned company prosecuted hundreds of post office operators, who were wrongly accused of stealing money from the branches they ran due to problems with the Horizon computer system that led to what has been described as Britain’s largest miscarriage of justice. It took years for the Post Office to admit that faults with Horizon, developed by Japan’s Fujitsu, were behind many of the shortfalls. Among the options considered by government officials was “retain and review” – giving Vennells “time to deliver her plans, and government time to prepare for her replacement should she fail to deliver on the plan”, the document said. This related to the Post Office’s 2010 plan which “failed to deliver the expected revenue growth”, according to the 2014 document. The document also said it would be “more difficult” to remove Vennells due to the impending general election, which took place in 2015. “Ministers would be conscious of the political implications,” it said. The paper considered several internal candidates and highlighted the then-commercial chief, Martin George, and the then-strategy director, Sue Barton, as potential successors to Vennells. The lead counsel for the inquiry, Jason Beer KC, asked Alice Perkins, who chaired the Post Office at the time, if Vennells preferred having “yes-men and yes-women” around her. Perkins denied this, but acknowledged that she began to have reservations about Vennells’ leadership in 2014 that were shared by other board members. Perkins said the documents were “complete news” to her and she was not aware of the discussions within government at the time. Vennells continued to run the Post Office until 2019, and was subsequently awarded a CBE “for services to the Post Office and to charity”. She handed the CBE back earlier this year before being formally stripped of it. Last month, Vennells told the inquiry that she was “too trusting” of subordinates and was advised to deny Fujitsu had remote access to terminals. At one point, she broke down in tears and said “I worked as hard as I possibly could to deliver the best Post Office for the UK.” During Thursday’s hearing, Perkins was shown an email that Vennells sent her twice in 2014 in which the then-chief executive said she was “more bored than outraged” about an item on the BBC One Show programme on the Post Office scandal. Perkins said she could not recall her reaction at the time but added: “Looking at this now, obviously it looks absolutely dreadful.” Upon repeated questioning, Perkins insisted: “The board was not bored of this issue and I have said on a number of occasions over the last two days that I think there were instances where the board should have acted differently.”",

        "title": "European Central Bank cuts main interest rate by 0.25 points",
        "content": "The European Central Bank has eased the pressure on borrowers across the eurozone after cutting its main interest rate for the first time in almost five years. Citing a sustained fall in inflation, the ECB said its deposit rate would be cut to 3.75% from a record high of 4%, putting it ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have yet to cut interest rates. Financial markets eagerly anticipated the first eurozone cut since September 2019, which will also affect the ECB’s main refinancing operations rate, which fell from 4.5% to 4.25%. City analysts had forecast the reduction in borrowing costs at the ECB’s June meeting after signals that the central bank was ready to offer more support to eurozone economies after a period of economic stagnation following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, the ECB said: “Keeping interest rates high for nine months has helped push down inflation. It is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction.” The ECB president, Christine Lagarde, said the central bank was confident that its forecasts were robust and if inflation continued its longer term downward trajectory, interest rates would continue to fall. She said: “It is on the basis of the reliability, solidity, robustness and strength of our projections that we have made the decision to cut.” Lagarde said pay settlements were moderating and companies were absorbing some of the increase in labour costs rather than passing them on to consumers, dampening inflationary pressures. However, she added that there were still risks to the outlook for inflation, saying: “Despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year.” Dean Turner, the chief eurozone economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the outlook for inflation, as indicated by the ECB’s latest projections, point to further interest rate reductions later this year. Turner said: “Of course, the timing of the next move from the ECB is uncertain, as this will be dependent upon incoming data. But with the disinflationary process firmly under way, the ECB, along with other central banks, should feel confident enough to ease policy, most likely at a pace of one cut per quarter.” However, the ECB expects inflation to be marginally higher this year and in 2025 than it was forecasting in March. It said inflation would average 2.5% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, up from its previous forecast of 2.3% and 2%, respectively. Mark Wall, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank, said the higher than previously forecast inflation numbers would make ECB policymakers more circumspect about futures cuts. Financial markets expect just one further reduction this year and three next year, knocking a further one percentage point off eurozone interest rates by the end of 2025. Wall said: “The statement arguably gave less guidance than might have been expected on what comes next. In that sense, the immediate tone is a ‘hawkish cut’. This is not a central bank in a rush to ease policy.” Strains with the eurozone are expected to show as economies recover from the pandemic and initial impact of the Ukraine war at different speeds. Croatia, which recently joined the euro, and Romania are among countries that are expected to grow by more than 3% this year, according to the European Commission, with inflation running at 3.5% and 5.9% respectively. Projections by the commission show the economies of France and the Netherlands will expand by less than 1% this year with an inflation rate of 2.5% in both countries. Lagarde said the ECB was aware of the variations across the currency bloc, but it was the central bank’s job to set interest rates based on average rates of growth and inflation. Economic growth across the eurozone is expected to improve after better-than-expected performances in Germany, Italy and Spain. The average growth rate for the eurozone would be 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, the ECB said.",

        "title": "Frank Hester donated further £5m to Tories in January, figures show",
        "content": "Frank Hester, the businessman at the centre of a row about comments condemned as racist and misogynistic, gave the Conservative party a further £5m in January, figures released by the Electoral Commission show. The donation, made by his company, the Phoenix Partnership (TPP), cements his status as the Tories’ single biggest donor, with a total of £15m now given by Hester either personally or through his company. Hester was at the centre of a political furore in March after the Guardian revealed he had told colleagues at his IT healthcare company in 2019 that looking at Diane Abbott made you “want to hate all black women” and that she “should be shot”. The data also shows that three days after the Guardian’s original story, the Conservatives accepted a further donation of £150,000 from the Phoenix Partnership. That donation had been received on 8 March and was accepted by the party on 14 March. Hester issued a statement apologising for his remarks about Abbott, describing them as “rude”, but said his “criticism had nothing to do with her gender nor colour of skin”. The statement said Hester abhorred racism, “not least because he experienced it as the child of Irish immigrants in the 1970s”. Despite widespread outrage at the remarks and eventual condemnation by Rishi Sunak, who called them “wrong” and “racist”, the Conservatives resisted calls from Labour and other parties to return Hester’s donations of £10m given last year. The latest donation is likely to prompt fresh calls for the party to return the funds to Hester or TPP. Abbott said news that the Conservatives had accepted another £5m from Hester was “an insult” to her “and all black women”. She tweeted: “Rishi Sunak belatedly admitted Frank Hester’s remarks that I made him hate all black woman and should be shot were racist. Now it turns out Sunak accepted a further £5m from him. An insult to me and all black women.” The Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, said: “Rishi Sunak has proven he is a man with no integrity. He is too weak to return the money donated by a man who has made violent, misogynist and racist remarks which belong nowhere near our politics. If Rishi Sunak had a backbone he’d have cut ties with Frank Hester months ago, returned the money and apologised properly to Diane Abbott.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said: “I think lifelong Conservative voters will be appalled by this. I think all those other people donating money to the Tory party should ask for their donations back.” Hester’s donations to the party since the beginning of 2023 represent 44% of the total national spending limit of £35m for each party in the general election, meaning returning it could create a significant shortfall. In April, Richard Holden, the Conservative party chair, refused four times when questioned on the BBC’s Politics Live to say whether the party had accepted a further £5m from Hester. This followed reports Holden had said he was “comfortable about accepting money when people have been clear about their views”. Holden said: “Mr Hester apologised fully for his comments at the time and I think if people have apologised then we should accept that, when they’ve clearly made a major contrition. I can’t comment on individual donations. It would be inappropriate.” The Conservatives and Labour have amassed huge war chests before the election. Over the past year the Tories have significantly outdone Labour, bringing in £44m, while Labour drew £24.6m – excluding public funds. However, in the first quarter of this year the fundraising was more evenly matched. The Conservatives brought in £8.48m and Labour raised £7.38m, excluding public funds. The Lib Dems brought in £2.48m in donations during the quarter, the Greens raised £400,000 and Reform, now led by Nigel Farage, got £25,000.",

        "title": "Boohoo investors seek £100m in damages after minimum wage row",
        "content": "A group of investors in Boohoo are seeking more than £100m in compensation from the online fashion specialist after reports in 2020 alleging its suppliers in Leicester were mistreating workers caused its share price to plummet. Shares in Boohoo dived more than 40% over several days, wiping more than £1.5bn off its valuation, after a 2020 Sunday Times report of labour rights violations at the group’s suppliers’ factories in Leicester suggested some workers were paid as little as £3.50 an hour, well below the legal minimum wage. A damning independent report conducted by Alison Levitt QC on behalf of the fast fashion retailer later found that allegations of poor working practices in the company’s supply chain – initially denied – were “substantially true”. A legal claim on behalf of 49 investors including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System – which has investment assets totalling $332.5bn – led by lawyers at Fox Williams filed against Boohoo Group last month alleges the company made untrue or misleading statements and failed to disclose or delayed the disclosure of material information about the matter to the market, breaching its obligations under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The group are understood to be seeking £100m in damages as well as legal costs and interest that could add millions of pounds more to the potential bill for Boohoo. The investors, whose legal filing was first revealed by City AM, say those who bought shares ahead of the 2020 report suffered huge losses as a result of the share price drop when the problems in Boohoo’s supply chain emerged. They say that further exposés on conditions in suppliers’ factories, including a BBC Panorama report screened in November last year, have led Boohoo’s share price to drop further. “Boohoo has long been aware of these issues, failing to keep to past promises of fair production,” said Andrew Hill, a partner at Fox Williams who has previously led two shareholder claims against Tesco that were settled out of court over the supermarket group’s admission of a profits overstatement in 2014. “Boohoo is a prominent example of a company that failed to live up to its environmental, social and governance (ESG) responsibilities and caused significant harm to investors. We believe that our clients have a strong case for compensation. “This is a landmark case that will test the legal framework for securities litigation in the UK and the role of ESG factors in corporate governance and disclosure.” A spokesperson for Boohoo said: “We have been made aware of a claim that is being brought by certain shareholders. The company strongly contests the allegations and will vigorously defend any claim.” According to the high court claims system, Boohoo has instructed the UK-Australian law firm Herbert Smith Freehills. The claim has emerged after protests from shareholders forced Boohoo to ditch a scheme under which its three top bosses were handed £1m in bonuses despite the company reporting a £160m loss.",

        "content": "Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia face increased antitrust scrutiny of their roles in the artificial intelligence industry after US regulators reportedly reached an agreement on investigating the companies. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have struck a deal on investigations into the main protagonists in the AI market, the New York Times reported, with the agreement expected to be completed in the coming days. The DoJ will lead on investigating whether Nvidia, the leading maker of chips that train and operate AI systems, has broken antitrust laws that oversee fair competition in business and aim to prevent monopolies, the NYT said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the FTC will scrutinise OpenAI, the company behind the ChatGPT chatbot, and Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest investor and a considerable financial backer of other AI companies. The Wall Street Journal also reported on Thursday that the FTC is investigating whether Microsoft structured a recent deal with startup Inflection AI to avoid an antitrust inquiry. In March, Microsoft hired Inflection’s CEO and co-founder, UK entrepreneur Mustafa Suleyman, as the boss of a new AI division and agreed to pay his company $650m (£508m) to license its AI software. The FTC has already signalled interest in the AI market. In January, it ordered OpenAI, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, and startup Anthropic to provide information on recent investments and partnerships involving generative AI companies and cloud service providers. Last year, it opened an investigation into OpenAI on claims it had run afoul of consumer protection laws by putting personal reputations and data at risk. The head of the DoJ’s antitrust division, Jonathan Kanter, told the Financial Times on Thursday that the organisation would look “with urgency” at the AI sector and would examine “monopoly choke points and the competitive landscape” in the technology. Kanter said regulators must act quickly to ensure that powerful tech companies do not control the market. The reports came as Nvidia’s valuation reached $3tn for the first time on Wednesday, edging ahead of Apple. Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt law school, said the reported collaboration between the DoJ and FTC reflected a relationship that has grown more collaborative under the Biden administration. “It used to be that the agencies divided the cases according to industry, but with this market being so large and important for antitrust enforcement, they are sharing responsibility and working hand-in-glove,” she said. “There is no doubt that the agencies see AI as the next frontier of anticompetitive conduct by firms already seen as avoiding and suppressing competition.” Microsoft said it was “confident” it had complied with antitrust obligations regarding the Inflection agreement. The FTC, DoJ, Nvidia and OpenAI declined to comment.",

        "title": "Investment in clean energy likely to be double figure for fossil fuels in 2024, IEA says",
        "content": "Global investment in low-carbon electricity will rise to 10 times as much as fossil fuel power this year due to an increase in spending on solar projects, according to the International Energy Agency. The global energy watchdog has predicted that investment in clean energy including renewables and nuclear power as well as electric vehicles, power grids, energy storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency improvements and heat pumps will reach $2tn this year. The global clean energy investment figure, which topped fossil fuels for the first time last year, is likely to be double the $1tn forecast for coal, gas and oil in 2024, the IEA said. “For every dollar going to fossil fuels today, almost $2 are invested in clean energy,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. However, spending on oil and gas is still too high to meet the world’s climate targets, according to Birol. Climate experts have warned that global climate targets will not be met if new investments are made into fossil fuels. Global coal investments have continued to rise, with more than 50GW of unabated coal-fired power approved last year, the highest since 2015. Global oil and gas investments are expected to increase by 7% in 2024 to reach $570bn, after a similar rise in 2023, led predominantly by state-owned oil companies in the Middle East and Asia, according to the report. These investments are broadly aligned with the forecast energy demand levels for 2030 based on current policies, but they are far higher than would be needed according to forecast models in which the world meet its climate goals, the IEA warned. Birol said oil and gas companies are “claiming to be part of the solution” but are continuing to spend on average just 4% of their investment budgets on clean energy projects, while national oil companies spend even less. The warning comes days after a separate IEA report revealed that the world is off track to meet the goal of tripling renewable electricity generation by 2030, a target viewed as vital to enable a swift global transition away from fossil fuels, despite record investments. Global clean energy investment has been driven by spending on solar farms, which is on track to reach $500bn this year, surpassing the investment in all other electricity generation technologies combined. This has been fuelled by a 30% fall in solar technology costs in the last two years and a rapid roll out of solar farms across China, which built as much new capacity in 2023 as the entire world did the year before, the IEA said. “Solar power is entirely essential to the transformation of the global energy system,” Birol said. Investment in low-carbon electricity – which includes renewables and nuclear power – is likely to reach more than $900bn this year, according to the report, 10 times higher than investment in gas and coal power generation. The proportion of global investment has swung further towards clean electricity sources since 2015, the year global governments signed the Paris climate accord, when it was twice the amount invested in fossil fuel-fired power. China is expected to lead the world in clean energy investment this year, reaching an estimated $675bn, through its investments in solar, lithium batteries and electric vehicles. Europe and the US are expected to invest $370bn and $315bn in clean energy respectively. Birol warned that more must be done to ensure that clean energy investment reaches “the places where it is needed most, in particular the developing economies where access to affordable, sustainable and secure energy is severely lacking today”.",

        "title": "Big Mac v Supermac’s: McDonald’s loses EU trademark fight",
        "content": "The small Irish takeaway chain Supermac’s has won a David v Goliath court battle with McDonald’s over the use of the Big Mac trademark, paving the way for it to open outlets across Europe. The ruling also means the US-founded fast food multinational has lost the right to use the name “Big Mac” in the EU in relation to chicken burgers. The decision by the European court of justice (ECJ) ends a marathon nine-year legal fight by the Irish operator against its global rival. A Supermac’s spokesperson said the chain also had a similar case pending in the UK that, if successful, could lead to an expansion into the British market. The legal tussle began in 2015, when Supermac’s tried to register its name in the EU as a trademark for restaurants, with a view to moving into the rest of Europe, prompting McDonald’s to oppose the application by Supermac’s as a name and a logo. McDonald’s argued that the name was too similar to its Big Mac burgers and would cause confusion among customers, winning a partial victory in 2016, when Supermac’s was granted the trademark for its restaurant name but not for many items of food and drink. The following year, the Irish chain founded in 1978 in Ballinasloe, County Galway, filed an application before the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) to end the exclusive use of the term “Big Mac” by McDonald’s in the bloc. It argued that the trademark had not been put to genuine use in the EU in connection with a restaurant name within a continuous five-year period, and accused McDonald’s of engaging in “trademark intimidation, registering brand names that are simply set aside to be used against future competitors”. The EUIPO partly upheld Supermac’s case in 2019, and on Wednesday the ECJ found in its favour with a decision to delist Big Mac as a trademarked restaurant name and stop the chain using it on poultry products. “We objected to them to their use of Big Mac as a restaurant because it is not a restaurant,” said Supermac’s founder, Pat McDonagh. “So what happened today is the European court has delisted it because they hadn’t used the trademark [as Big Mac for a restaurant] … Then the ECJ went a bit further: they said Big Mac can be used as a meat product, a burger, but it can’t be used as a chicken product.” The ECJ said: “The evidence which was submitted by McDonald’s does not provide any indication of the extent of use of the mark in connection with those goods, in particular as regards to the volume of sales, the length of the period during which the mark was used and the frequency of use.” McDonagh said: “This is a significant ruling that takes a commonsense approach to the use of trademarks by large multinationals. It represents a significant victory for small businesses throughout the world. “The original objective of our application to cancel was to shine a light on the use of trademark bullying by this multinational to stifle competition. We have been saying for years that they have been using trademark bullying.” The ECJ said: “McDonald’s has not proved that the contested mark has been put to genuine use as regards the goods ‘chicken sandwiches’, the goods ‘foods prepared from poultry products’ and the ‘services rendered or associated with operating restaurants and other establishments or facilities engaged in providing food and drink prepared for consumption and for drive-through facilities; preparation of carry-out foods’.” The intellectual property lawyer Matthew Harris at UK law firm Pinsent Masons described the ruling as “a huge wakeup call” for owners of well-known trademarks that they must, like smaller rivals, evidence use of trademarks or risk losing them. A statement from McDonald’s said: “The decision by the EU general court does not affect our right to use the ‘BIG MAC’ trademark. The BIG MAC trademark is incredibly strong throughout the world, including in the EU, and this decision will not in any way impact our ability to use or to protect the trademark against infringements. “McDonald’s has held the EU BIG MAC trademark registration since 1996 and it remains in full force and effect for the iconic sandwich that our fans around the world have come to know and love. In partnership with our franchisees, we’re excited to continue to proudly serve our Big Mac and our local communities, as we have done for decades.” A spokesperson for McDonald’s said: “The decision by the EU general court does not affect our right to use the ‘Big Mac’ trademark. Our iconic Big Mac is loved by customers all across Europe, and we are excited to continue to proudly serve local communities, as we have done for decades.”",

        "content": "Another Boeing whistleblower has come forward with claims that safety and quality issues were ignored and concerns were dismissed by management. Roy Irvin, who worked at Boeing’s plant in South Carolina from 2011 to 2017 as a quality investigator, alleged that he was reprimanded as “insubordinate” for flagging safety and quality issues on 787 Dreamliner planes that he inspected. “Missing safety devices on hardware or un-tightened hardware means that you’re not going to be able to control the airplane if those fail,” Irvin told the New York Post. “The safety device is on there. If the fastener is not secured correctly, it’s going to fall off and you’re not gonna be able to control the airplane.” The development comes after the Guardian spoke with workers at Boeing’s Everett, Washington plant, who said the factory was in “panic mode” as they stripped and repaired 787 jets flown across from South Carolina to be fixed. Brian Knowles, an attorney who represents whistleblowers including Irvin, claimed his law firm has fielded dozens of inquiries from Boeing whistleblowers over the past several weeks. “Most of the people we’re hearing from are current employees,” Knowles told the New York Post, adding that the employees were advocating for the company to get back on track and take criticisms and safety concerns seriously. Irvin worked with John Barnett, a Boeing whistleblower found dead in March. The local coroner later determined he had died by suicide. A second whistleblower, 45-year-old Joshua Dean, who previously worked as a quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, died from an illness in April. Santiago Paredes, another whistleblower, who worked for Spirit AeroSystems as a former quality manager, told CBS News in May that “it was very rare for us to look at a job and not find any defects”. Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour also came forward earlier this year, issuing a stark warning about 787 jets. Boeing has insisted it is “fully confident” of the 787’s safety and durability, citing “extensive and rigorous” testing. “I have serious concerns about the safety of the 787 and 777 aircraft and I’m willing to take on professional risk to talk about them,” Salehpour said in a US Senate hearing. When he raised concerns to management, he “was ignored”, he said. “I was told not to create delays. I was told, frankly, to shut up.” In a statement, Boeing said it “takes very seriously” any allegation of improper work or unethical behavior. “We continuously encourage employees to report concerns as our priority is to ensure the safety of our airplanes and the flying public,” the company said, “and we will take any necessary action to ensure our airplanes meet regulatory requirements.”",

        "title": "European Central Bank expected to cut interest rates for first time in five years",
        "content": "The European Central Bank is expected to cut interest rates for the first time in almost five years at its meeting on Thursday after a survey of private sector businesses showed activity expanded at the fastest pace in a year while inflation cooled. The latest HCOB purchasing managers’ index (PMI) data, compiled by S&amp;P Global, showed private sector output expanded in most economies covered by the euro currency after growth in Germany, Italy and Spain was only marginally offset by a downturn in France. Ahead of European parliament elections this week, businesses said they had put up prices at a slower rate than in April, leading to lower inflation across the eurozone, despite a rise in the price of raw materials and other input costs beyond the levels seen before the pandemic. The headline business activity index climbed to a one-year high of 52.2 in May from 51.7 in April, where a figure above 50 indicates growth. ECB rate setters will meet in Frankfurt on Thursday and are forecast to shave a quarter of a percentage point off its 4% deposit interest rate. Financial markets expect the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, to resist signalling a series of rate cuts through the year after concerns that inflationary pressures are rising amid the return to growth across the 20-member currency bloc. There were concerns among borrowers that the central bank may delay a reduction in interest costs after official data showed eurozone inflation rose to 2.6% in May from 2.4% in April, but the increase could prove to be a blip, if the PMI data reveals a fresh downward trend. Last month, unemployment fell to its lowest level on record across the EU and the eurozone economy expanded in the first quarter after a mild contraction in the second half of 2023. Bill Papadakis, a senior strategist at the consultancy Lombard Odier, said: “After two years of stagnation, Europe’s economic developments in 2024 are proving positive. Growth is rising, unemployment has fallen to a record low, and normalising inflation means that the ECB is ready to start cutting interest rates.” Of the top four economies, France proved to be the outlier after a slight contraction in private sector activity in May that contrasted with growth in Germany, Spain and Italy. Spain’s position as the top performer was solidified after the rate of growth quickened to a 14-month high. A survey of US businesses found that all sectors expanded at a faster rate in May than April except the healthcare industry, which contracted for a second month. The S&amp;P Global PMI found that new orders and “greater customer demand” in the financial sector helped push growth higher, “signalling a more positive landscape for US firms, as six of the seven monitored sectors registered an expansion in output”. Growth in the UK’s service sector fell back in May, according to the S&amp;P Services PMI as business activity and new orders eased from an 11-month high in April. The service sector covers about 75% of private sector activity, making the S&amp;P Global PMI a closely watched survey. Marking a slowdown from highs earlier this year, the activity index fell to 52.9 last month, the slowest since November last year, from April’s 55. Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, which compiles the data, said surveys of the services and manufacturing sectors indicated the UK economy was losing momentum and was on course to expand by 0.3% in the second quarter, down from 0.6% growth in the first quarter. He said prices in the service sector rose at the slowest pace in three years, giving the Bank of England the comfort it needs before a meeting by its monetary policy committee (MPC) later this month to reduce the cost of borrowing. He added: “That’s now three months on the trot that selling price inflation in the service sector has eased. This will be very encouraging to the MPC and suggests the trajectory of services prices is moving in the right direction. “It is worth noting, however, that the PMI’s gauge of UK services inflation is still sitting well above its pre-pandemic trend, which may give more weight to those suggesting the Bank of England hold out until August to loosen policy.” • This article was amended on 6 June 2024. In an earlier version, the subheading misdescribed the ECB’s expected interest rate cut as “a 25 percentage point cut”.",

        "title": "Australia is on the brink of recession. So why does the RBA think we are spending too much? | Greg Jericho",
        "content": "The latest GDP figures reveal that the RBA has got its wish of an economy growing so slowly that it teeters on the edge of a recession. Now we wait to see if unemployment also starts to falter and tips us over that edge. No, we are not in a recession, but cripes, the March quarter national accounts show an economy performing as badly as it can without actually being in recession. The 0.1% growth in the March quarter is essentially a rounding error away from going backwards. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup And things are no better if we look at annual growth. If we take out the pandemic period – when economic data really made no sense – the 1.1% annual growth of GDP is the slowest we have seen in Australia since March 1992. Take out population growth and we have now had five consecutive quarters of the economy going backwards. It’s the first time that has happened since we started recording per capita growth back in 1973. That is not a record you want to be setting. In the past year the economy shrank 1.3% when you exclude population growth. The pandemic years aside, that is the worst growth since December 1991, when we were in the deepest of deep recessions: If the graph does not display click here So no, not good. Why are things so slow? Well, just take a peek at how much average interest repayments have gone up in the past two years: If the graph does not display click here The RBA has essentially done in two years what it took five years to do during the mining boom, when household incomes and wages were rising strongly. It has done this because the RBA believes that there is “excess demand” in the economy. Clearly they have a different view of excess than the rest of us. The only reason really to even care about GDP as a measure is that there is a generally solid link between it and unemployment. As a rule we need the economy to grow about 2.75% a year to keep unemployment stable. If GDP grows by less than that, unemployment usually starts rising: If the graph does not display click here If there was no link between GDP growth and unemployment, then to be honest it would be a meaningless number we might as well ignore. The other important thing about GDP is that households make up a bit over half of it, so if GDP is struggling there’s a good chance that people are, too – and right now the level of living standards of Australian households is back where it was a decade ago: If the graph does not display click here That is not a sign of health. And what has been the big driver of weak living standards? Well, did you remember my mentioning interest rate rises? If the graph does not display click here The increased cost of paying off home loans has had a major impact on people’s living standards, but so too has weak wages growth. In the March quarter the average compensation for each employee rose 0.6% while the average cost of things we spend our money on (including bills) rose 1%. Not surprisingly what we’re seeing is households spending very frugally. We never quite got back to spending as much as we likely would have were it not for the pandemic – but now the amount we’re spending is increasing by less than it was before 2020: If the graph does not display click here In the year to March, household spending rose 1.3% – around half the pre-pandemic rate. And any growth was mostly on essential items. Spending on essentials rose 2.1% over the past year, while spending on discretionary items – those things you buy when you are feeling good – rose just 0.1%. That does not sound like excess demand to me, but apparently the RBA thinks it does. We aren’t spending more because we have so much more income, rather that we are saving less. The household saving rate was as low as it has been since 2008: If the graph does not display click here It means overall households did not contribute much to the growth of the economy, but to be honest, no one was really contributing to the growth of the economy because there was hardly any! If the graph does not display click here If you squint you could say the buildup of inventories is a sign that businesses hope to be able to sell stock later, but more likely it is just replenishing the stocks they have run down over the past few months rather than a sign of hope and optimism. The cost of labour in real terms fell 0.7% in the March quarter to reinforce again that wages are not fueling inflation. The real cost of profits remains higher than it was before the pandemic, unlike labour costs: If the graph does not display click here The GDP figures show an economy that has been smashed by interest rate rises. The RBA believes we are too rich, too many of us are employed and we are spending too much money. The GDP figures, however, show our living standards are as bad as they have been for a decade, our wages are not keeping up with our costs, and we are barely increasing our spending on anything other than essential goods and services. The economy has been going backwards for more than a year, except for population growth. Take that away and it looks like a recession. The only reason we are not in one is because – thankfully – unemployment has not risen sharply yet. And let us hope that is not the next chapter of the RBA’s sorry tale of how the economy should be managed. Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work",

        "content": "The Bank of Canada has cut interest rates by a quarter point, becoming the first G-7 nation to lower borrowing costs in the current cycle. The European Central Bank is expected to follow suit tomorrow. Business activity in the eurozone grew at the fastest rate in a year, while inflation cooled in May -- welcome news for the European Central Bank, which meets tomorrow and is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter point. By contrast, the UK services sector lost some momentum last month, as business activity and new orders eased from 11-month highs in April. That said, job growth and business confidence improved slightly. On a brighter note, there was a substantial cooling in the rate of UK firms’ input cost inflation, which fell to its weakest level since February 2021. This fed through to prices charged by businesses, which rose at the slowest rate in more than three years. Economic activity in the US services sector returned to growth in May after contracting marginally in April for the first time since December 2022, as just reported. The UK shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has accused Rishi Sunak of lying after it emerged that a senior Treasury official warned Tory ministers not to say civil servants were behind their claim that a Labour government would increase taxes by £2,000. The prime minister made the claim throughout his ITV head-to-head debate with Keir Starmer, saying “independent Treasury officials” had costed Labour’s policies “and they amount to a £2,000 tax rise for everyone”. In a letter to the Labour party on Monday, James Bowler, the Treasury permanent secretary, said ministers had been told not to suggest civil servants had produced the figure at the heart of the Tory attack. India’s stock market recovered somewhat following yesterday’s sell-off, caused by uncertainty over the country’s next government and its policies. Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata party has lost its parliamentary majority, dealing an unexpected blow to the Indian prime minister and forcing him to negotiate with coalition partners in order to return to power. He has been meeting key allies at his official residence. India’s main stock indices, the Nify 50 and the BSE Sensex, both rose more than 3%, after sliding close to 6% yesterday. The Indian rupee ticked up to 83.37 per dollar, probably aided by intervention from the central bank after the currency fell the most in over a year yesterday. European stock markets are trading modestly higher. The UK’s FTSE 100 index is 13 points ahead at 8,245 while Germany’s Dax has gained 0.9%, France’s CAC is almost 1% higher and Italy’s FTSE MiB rose almost 0.9%. Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Bye! – JK Economic activity in the US services sector returned to growth in May after contracting marginally in April for the first time since December 2022, according to the nation’s purchasing and supply executives in the latest services Report On Business from the Institute for Supply Management. The headline reading was 53.8 in May, up from 49.4 in April. The 50 mark divides expansion from contraction. Anthony Nieves of ISM said: Survey respondents indicated that overall business is increasing, with growth rates continuing to vary by company and industry. Employment challenges remain, primarily attributed to difficulties in backfilling positions and controlling labor expenses. The majority of respondents indicate that inflation and the current interest rates are an impediment to improving business conditions. Business Activity Index at 61.2 New Orders Index at 54.1 Employment Index at 47.1 Supplier Deliveries Index at 52.7 Iain Connor, partner at the law firm Michelmores, said Google is “in for a rough ride” over the next two years: Google’s dominance in search is unquestionable; all of which is maintained by its vast advertising revenues. The fact that the Competition Appeals Tribunal has certified the case to go forward to test whether it is abusing that dominant position to prevent other AdTech companies competing is massive. All this against a backdrop of the UK’s new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act which will designate Google as a Strategic Market Status firm giving the Competition and Markets Authority the power to impose ‘Conduct Requirements’ on it, means Google is in for a rough ride over the next couple of years. A £13.6bn claim against Google over allegations that it has behaved anti-competitively in the digital advertising space can proceed to trial, the UK’s Competition Appeal Tribunal has ruled. The claim, brought by a group called Ad Tech Collective Action, alleges that Google has abused its dominant position, causing significant losses to UK online publishers, PA reported. In its attempts to get the legal action dropped, Google called the case “incoherent”, but the Competition Appeal Tribunal has now ruled that it can go to trial. The case centres around advertising technology, or ad tech, the system that decides which online adverts people see and how much they cost -- a major source of revenue for many websites and a vital, valuable sector for Google because its search engine is the most widely used and it offers a number of services in the ad tech space. At the heart of the Ad Tech Collective Action argument is the claim that Google has abused its position in the market by promoting its own products and services over those of its rivals. It argues that the activity has meant publishers have received less money from ads they host, as well as paying higher fees to Google. Claudio Pollack, a partner of Ad Tech Collective Action, said: This is a decision of major importance to the victims of Google’s anti-competitive conduct in ad tech. Google will now have to answer for its practices in a full trial. I look forward to working with our legal and economic advisers to deliver compensation for years during which the relevant markets did not provide a competitive outcome for the UK publishing market. No court date has yet been set for the trial. Oliver Bethell, legal director at Google, said: Google works constructively with publishers across the UK and Europe - our advertising tools, and those of our many ad tech competitors, help millions of websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers. These services adapt and evolve in partnership with those same publishers. This lawsuit is speculative and opportunistic. We’ll oppose it vigorously and on the facts. The legal action comes as Google is under scrutiny from regulators in the UK, US and Europe around its actions in the ad tech sector. Zara owner Inditex reported a pick-up in recent sales from its spring/summer collections, sending its shares 5% higher, as the world’s biggest fashion retailer delivered quarterly results in line with expectations. The Spanish retailer, whose full name is Industria de Diseño Textil, said sales rose 12% between 1 May and 3 June compared with the year-earlier period. This was faster than the 7% rise in sales for its first quarter to the end of April, although sales had been expected to slow from a year earlier when the company benefited from a post-pandemic shopping spree. Inditex, which also owns Pull&amp;Bear and Massimo Dutti, is battling fierce competition from its Swedish rival H&amp;M, as well as fast fashion retailers Shein and Temu by delivering fashion trends faster through investment in logistics and technology. Shein, the Chinese online fashion company, is preparing for a London listing. However, France’s lower house of parliament has backed a string of measures to make low-cost fast fashion, especially items from Chinese mass producers, less attractive to buyers. Inditex’s chief executive Oscar Garcia Maceiras told analysts the company would expand livestream services through its own platforms to markets including the US and the UK following good results in China. We expect to launch this new service in the coming weeks. He added the company would also increase store selling space by about 5% a year until 2026, after upgrading or opening stores in 28 markets in recent months. Inditex now has 5,698 shops. The small Irish takeaway chain Supermac’s has won a David v Goliath court battle with McDonald’s over the use of the Big Mac trademark, paving the way for it to open outlets across Europe. The ruling also means the US-founded fast food multinational has lost the right to use the name “Big Mac” in the EU in relation to chicken burgers. The decision by the European court of justice (ECJ) ends a marathon 17-year legal fight by the Irish operator against its global rival. A Supermac’s spokesperson said the chain also had a similar case pending in the UK that, if successful, could lead to an expansion into the British market. The legal tussle began in 2007, when Supermac’s tried to register its name in the EU as a trademark for restaurants, with a view to moving into the rest of Europe, prompting McDonald’s to oppose the application by Supermac’s as a name and a logo. McDonald’s argued that the name was too similar to its Big Mac burgers and would cause confusion among customers, winning a partial victory in 2016, when Supermac’s was granted the trademark for its restaurant name but not for many items of food and drink. The following year, the Irish chain founded in 1978 in Ballinasloe, County Galway, filed an application before the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) to end the exclusive use of the term “Big Mac” by McDonald’s in the bloc. It argued that the trademark had not been put to genuine use in the EU in connection with a restaurant name within a continuous five-year period, and accused McDonald’s of engaging in “trademark intimidation, registering brand names that are simply set aside to be used against future competitors”. The EUIPO partly upheld Supermac’s case in 2019, and on Wednesday the ECJ found in its favour with a decision to delist Big Mac as a trademarked restaurant name and stop the chain using it on poultry products. Asda is now the UK’s most expensive supermarket fuel seller, research shows, after the retailer’s private owners ditched its long-held pledge to be the cheapest on the market. The retailer, which was bought by the billionaire Issa brothers and their private equity partner TDR Capital in 2021, charged an average 2.1p a litre more for unleaded petrol than rivals Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons at the end of May, according to an analysis by the RAC motoring organisation. The difference in average diesel prices was even steeper, at 2.5p a litre, according to the study using data gathered by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) which has been closely monitoring fuel prices in an effort to ensure motorists are not being ripped off. The Issa brothers made their fortune from petrol forecourts. After acquiring Asda they folded part of their forecourts business, EG Group, into the supermarket chain. At the time of the deal in May 2023, Mohsin Issa said it would enable him to offer “Asda’s highly competitive fuel” to more customers. Three British energy companies have decided to delay by a year the planned start of oil production at their joint-venture oilfield in the North Sea –– citing the need for clarity on the next government’s policies. Jersey Oil &amp; Gas, which owns 20% of the Buchan field 120 miles northeast of Aberdeen, announced this today on behalf of the joint venture partners, among them Serica Energy and NEO Energy. Shares in Jersey slid more than 16% and Serica’s shares dipped nearly 1% on the news. Many North Sea oil and gas producers have been merging, shifting overseas, or cutting investment, after the UK government’s windfall tax slashed profits and the opposition Labour Party threatened more tax if it wins the next general election on 4 July. When Serica bought its 30% stake in the Buchan field from Jersey in February, the target for the start of oil production was the fourth quarter of 2026. That target has now moved to late 2027. Jersey said the Buchan Field Development Plan was on course for end-2024 approval. But it added: The exact timing for achieving this key milestone and enabling project sanction is naturally linked to securing fiscal clarity from the next government and ensuring that the project remains financially attractive. The Labour Party, which has a strong lead in the polls, has vowed to raise the windfall tax by 3% to help fund its energy transition strategy, which the North Sea oil industry has complained would further deter investment. Brendan Long, an analyst at the wealth manager WH Ireland, said: We anticipate the UK government will provide fiscal clarity such that the operator of the Buchan redevelopment will have sufficient confidence in the fiscal regime to progress with project sanction. It is the best undeveloped oilfield of its kind in the UK North Sea in terms of scale and low risk, he added. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: As Britain prepares for next month’s general election, the new car market continues to hold steady as large fleets sustain growth, offsetting weakened private retail demand. Consumers enjoy a plethora of new electric models and some very attractive offers, but manufacturers can’t sustain this scale of support on their own indefinitely. Their success so far should be a signpost for the next government that a faster and fairer transition requires carrots, not just sticks. In other UK news, the new car market held steady last month with company fleets driving growth. New car registrations rose 1.7% in May, according to the industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). With 147,678 vehicles reaching the road, it was the best May market performance since 2021, although it remains down 19.6% on 2019, before the Covid pandemic. Fleets and businesses continued to fuel market growth, up 14% and 9.5% respectively, narrowly offsetting a 12.9% decline in uptake from individual buyers. While deliveries of both petrol and diesel cars fell, demand for electrified vehicles rose, with plug-in hybrids recording the highest growth, up 31.5% to reach an 8% market share. Sales of hybrids rose by 9.6%, maintaining their status as the third most popular fuel type after petrol and battery electric, at 13.2% of the market. Nick Williams, transport managing director at Lloyds Banking Group, said: Despite a challenging start to the year for consumers and businesses alike, it’s heartening to see electric vehicle sales continue to increase. That’s feeding through to confidence with those we speak to, which in turn will fuel investment in new models and spur sales further. Consistency will be key to maintaining that long term confidence and helping the market grow. As it does, momentum will pick up and the second-hand market will entice yet more people to make the leap. With consumer trust and confidence low, which is affecting retail registrations, it’s time to bust the myths surrounding electric vehicles. As an industry, we need to come together to ensure drivers are informed of the cost saving of driving and charging electric vehicles. By contrast, the UK services sector lost some momentum in May, as business activity and new orders eased from 11-month highs in April. That said, job growth and business confidence improved slightly. On a brighter note, there was a substantial cooling in the rate of firm’s input cost inflation, which fell to its weakest since February 2021. This fed through to prices charged by businesses, which rose at the slowest rate in more than three years. The closely watched S&amp;P Global UK services PMI business activity index fell to 52.9 last month from April’s 11-month high of 55, indicating a softer rate of expansion that was also the slowest since November last year. Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, which compiles the survey, said: The PMI survey for May showed another reasonable rate of expansion in the UK service sector. Taken in tandem with our earlier-released manufacturing survey, the PMIs imply GDP growth of around 0.3% so far in the second quarter. Of particular interest to the immediate outlook for the UK economy will be the prices measures, with the Bank of England potentially moving to cut interest rates as soon as this month. The PMI surveys show prices for UK services rising at the slowest pace for over three years. That’s now three months on the trot that selling price inflation in the service sector has eased – this will be very encouraging to the Monetary Policy Committee and suggests the trajectory of services prices is moving in the right direction. It is worth noting however that the PMI’s gauge of UK services inflation is still sitting well above its pre-pandemic trend, which may give more weight to those suggesting the Bank of England hold out until August to loosen policy. Business activity the eurozone as a whole grew at the fastest rate in a year, while inflation cooled -- welcome news for the European Central Bank, which meets tomorrow and is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter point. The latest HCOB PMI data compiled by S&amp;P Global showed the headline business activity index climbed to a one-year high of 52.2 in May from 51.7 in April. Of the top four economies, France was the outlier in May as a slight contraction in private sector activity contrasted with growth in Germany, Spain and Italy. Spain’s position as the top performer was solidified as economic growth here was sharp, quickening to a 14-month high. The bloc’s largest economy, Germany, also registered a marked upturn, with output volumes rising at the fastest pace for a year. On the other hand, Italy’s expansion lost momentum, cooling to its weakest since February. Stronger demand was a key reason behind May’s upturn in business output across the euro area. Total new order intakes rose for a second month in a row and at the fastest rate since April 2023. There was a further pickup in demand for services, while the downturn in factory orders cooled markedly from the previous month. The survey indicated that improved sales performances were restricted to domestic markets, as new business received from abroad declined, in line with the trend since March 2022. Prices gauges signalled cooling inflationary pressures across the eurozone half way through the second quarter. However, the increase in input costs remained sharp and well above its pre-pandemic average. It was a similar picture for output prices where the selling price increases eased to a six-month low, but remained considerably steeper than seen on average prior to 2020. Manufacturers continued to see reductions in both pricing measures, whereas services companies registered historically sharp rises. Unlike its neighbours, France’s services sector suffered a slight setback. After rising in April for the first time in nearly a year, activity levels shrank slightly in May. That said, there was a sustained pick-up in sales, driven by domestic demand, while employment continued to rise. The headline France services PMI business activity index fell from 51.3 in April to 49.3 last month. Inflationary pressured cooled across France, with rates of increase in input costs and output charges the weakest since July and May of 2021 respectively. Norman Liebke, economist at Hamburg at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: The latest HCOB PMI figures are giving mixed messages about the state of the French services sector. Although business activity declined slightly in May, overall demand grew for the second month in a row. Additionally, although at a slower pace, employment improved for another month, showing robust expectations about the future. Services inflation slowed in May, but stayed fairly elevated. For input prices, the increase can be attributed to higher salaries and greater supplier charges. Wages remain a risk for the ECB due to the possibility of a resurge in consumer price inflation. Service providers managed to pass on higher costs to customers, but only partially, as evidenced by the output prices index signalling only a marginal rate of increase. In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, service sector growth picked up to a 12-month high in May. The services PMI headline index climbed from April’s 53.2 to 54.2, further above the 50 no change threshold for the third month running. Firms stepped up hiring, and inflationary pressures in the economy’s largest sector eased. Although still above their long-run averages, the rates of increase in both input costs and output prices were the weakest for three years. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, which produces the survey, said: Things are looking up. The mood in the German service sector is improving month by month. There’s growing hope that the German economy is not the sick man of Europe after all. In fact, Germany is no longer lagging behind other countries and has passed this baton to France, where the service sector has slipped back into recession. Meanwhile, Germany’s service sector has caught up with Italy’s and almost also to Spain’s, whose business activities have been rising since the beginning of the year and last autumn, respectively. A well-performing tourism sector likely plays a crucial role in this upswing. Italy also showed a sustained upturn in its services sector last month. Growth was maintained for both new business and activity, but at slightly slower rates. Optimism among service providers also held up, as business expectations were their most upbeat for 27 months and job creation gained momentum. The headline index from the report slipped slightly to 54.2 in May from 54.3 in April. Tariq Kamal Chaudhry, economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, which releases the survey, said: The service sector is showing resilience. The promising outlook, with growing orders both domestically and internationally, is reflected in increased hiring. What’s encouraging about the employment figure is that respondents noted that many new hires were on permanent contracts. A major downside of the survey is the continued sharp rise in input prices. Panellists have reported higher costs for personnel, energy, and utilities. The only silver lining is that they can pass on at least some of the price growth to consumers due to improved demand conditions. Spain’s services sector showed the steepest rise in activity for more than a year in May, according to a survey. Confidence in the future strengthened to a level that matched February’s two-year high. However, cost pressures intensified noticeably, with input prices rising faster than their historical trend as firms spent more on salaries. The headline index from the HCOB services PMI (purchasing managers’ index) survey rose to 56.99 in May from from 56.2 April, better than expected and the strongest growth since April 2023. TikTok has said it is taking measures to tackle a cyber attack that targeted several celebrities and brand accounts, including Paris Hilton and CNN. The social media app confirmed that CNN’s feed was one of a small number of “high profile” accounts that had been affected after its security team was alerted to malicious actors targeting the US news outlet. A TikTok spokesperson said: We have been collaborating closely with CNN to restore account access and implement enhanced security measures to safeguard their account moving forward. TikTok also said that the account of reality TV star Paris Hilton was targeted but not compromised. The social media company told the Associated Press that the attack took place through the platform’s direct messaging feature but would not give any more details. It is still investigating the what happened and working with affected account owners who need their access restored. The news of the hack comes as the app, which is owned by Chinese tech firm Byte Dance, is under scrutiny in the US over concerns over whether it poses a national security threat. Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would see the app banned across the country unless ByteDance can sell it to a non-Chinese entity by mid-January next year. TikTok, which has around 170 million users in the US, revealed last month that it was taking legal action to block the law, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated free speech. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. New banknotes featuring a portrait of King Charles III have entered circulation today, nearly two years after he succeeded the late Queen Elizabeth as head of state. The king’s image will appear on the new £5, £10, £20 and £50 notes issued by the Bank of England. Existing notes that carry a portrait of Elizabeth will continue to circulate. However, it will take some time before the new notes are commonly seen in people’s wallets and purses. The new notes will gradually replace damaged banknotes, or will be printed when demand increases. The Bank of England said: This approach is in line with guidance from the Royal Household, to minimise the environmental and financial impact of this change. This means the public will begin to see the new King Charles III notes very gradually. Elizabeth was the first monarch to feature on banknotes in 1960, in contrast to coins in England which have carried images of kings and queens for more than 1,000 years. The reverse side of Bank of England polymer banknotes are unchanged, featuring Sir Winston Churchill, Jane Austen, JMW Turner and Alan Turing. Notes issued in Scotland and Northern Ireland do not feature the monarch. In financial markets, Asian stocks are mixed, with Japan’s Nikkei 0.9% lower, dragged down by the renewed strength of the yen, and the Shanghai Composite slipping 0.7% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.4%. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.5%. In India, the Nifty 50 index rose 1.9% in volatile trading, after sliding nearly 6% on Tuesday, its worst session in four years, when foreign investors sold around $1.5bn worth of shares. The BSE Sensex (formerly Bombay Stock Exchange) rose 2% after losing 5.7% yesterday. Both indices had touched lifetime highs on Monday. Narendra Modi’s ruling BJP party lost an outright majority in parliament for the first time since he became prime minister in May 2014, forcing him to forge a coalition government to return to power. This has sparked uncertainty over economic policies, including Modi’s push for investment-led growth. Mark Matthews, head of research for Asia at the bank Julius Baer said: While the BJP’s power may be diluted, it’s still intact. Momentum in the economy from the existing reforms is still strong and will not fade away.

        "content": "It was a cruel summer for the Australian economy, but Swiftonomics delivered a small but welcome boost. US superstar Pink’s tour and the Australian Grand Prix, held in Melbourne in March for the first time since 2019, were also singled out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as boosts to national economic activity, after the latest gross domestic product data was released on Wednesday. While the economy grew by just 0.1% between January and March – the weakest quarterly growth on an annual basis since December 2020 – that figure camouflages moments of economic buzz generated by international entertainers and sportspeople. Australians bought more than 600,000 tickets for the local leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour, which came to Melbourne and Sydney in February. Pink, whose Summer Carnivals concerts toured seven cities across Australia in February and March, was also part of the effect. Over that time, arts and recreation services rose 2.7%, “driven by record attendances at large music and sporting events across major cities”, the ABS March quarter report stated. Accommodation and food services were down 1.5%, a figure that “experienced a boost from several large-scale sporting and music events being held during the quarter”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Katherine Keenan, ABS head of national accounts, said the events added to household spending over the period. “Spending on [Taylor Swift, Pink and the Melbourne grand prix] contributed to the overall rise in household spending, benefiting the accommodation, catering, and arts and recreation industries in Victoria and New South Wales”, she said. Swift’s impact on retail alone saw the sector turnover rise 0.3% in February 2024 – a figure that would have been lower had the Eras tour not come to Australia, said Ben Dorber, ABS head of retail statistics. “Seven sold-out Taylor Swift concerts in Sydney and Melbourne boosted retail spending this month, with over 600,000 Swifties flocking to these events. This led to increased spending on clothing, merchandise, accessories and dining out,” he said in March. “Looking past the temporary and one-off impact of the Taylor Swift concerts, underlying growth in retail turnover was up only 0.1% in trend terms.” Business Sydney forecast the star’s impact to deliver a $113m windfall, while an RMIT estimate rounded her national impact to more than half a billion dollars. Her economic effects have been seen elsewhere, including Singapore and the US, where Swift’s tour has been linked to inflation. In the UK, it is predicted to boost the economy by $1.27bn.",

        "title": "Mike Lynch: four key takeaways from the fraud trial of ‘Britain’s Bill Gates’",
        "content": "A US jury has begun deliberating the fate of British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch in a corporate fraud trial that began in March, as a years-long saga over a 2011 acquisition deal approaches its end. Lynch is charged with 15 counts of fraud, though originally he faced 16; one count of securities fraud was dismissed last week in a notable victory for his defense. The charges center on allegations that Lynch artificially inflated numbers at his software firm Autonomy prior to an $11bn acquisition deal made with Hewlett-Packard. HP wrote down Autonomy’s value by $8.8bn in 2012, saying it had uncovered serious accounting improprieties. The British technology tycoon once lauded as “Britain’s Bill Gates” faces as many as 25 years in prison and was extradited to the US for the trial, which has taken place in a San Francisco federal court house. Lynch has pleaded not guilty. The 11-week-long trial chronicled the alleged missteps made by the businessman, who prosecutors said was the “driving force” behind a “massive” years-long fraud. Lynch’s team, meanwhile, argued the case amounted to a “routine business dispute” in which there was no deliberate wrongdoing. After many days of arguments from opposing sides, including testimony from Lynch himself, here is what we have learned about the controversial case. Prosecutors argue Lynch showed a pattern of intimidation Throughout the trial, prosecutors sought to paint Lynch as a ruthless businessman who “spun a fabulous tale of corporate success” to deceive HP into making a bad deal. To that end, they interviewed witnesses about indications of a mob-like business culture at Autonomy, citing everything from the presence of piranhas in the office fish tank to meeting rooms named after James Bond villains to characterize the executive as a tough, threatening boss. On the stand, Lynch sought to humanize himself, discussing his childhood in England and the exciting rise of his company. He soberly explained business decisions at Autonomy, arguing that he did not have a direct hand in the alleged fraud in question. In closing arguments, assistant US attorney Robert Leach told jurors they should have no reasonable doubt there was fraud at Autonomy, and that Lynch directed it. He highlighted that Lynch had made £500m ($640m) from the HP deal, and told jurors to follow the money. “Dr Lynch had 500m reasons to defraud HP,” he said. “It tells you volumes about who was in charge and who benefited from this.” Decade-old memories make vague evidence: ‘I can’t give you a specific date for certain’ The trial centers around Hewlett-Packard’s 2011 acquisition of Autonomy and alleged fraudulent actions taken by Lynch in the time leading up to it. Crucially, US district judge Charles Breyer ruled that the trial not be focused on actions following the acquisition. The defense has criticized the decision, as Lynch has long maintained the financial struggles Autonomy faced were a result of HP’s mismanagement. With proceedings focused on allegations that Lynch purposefully inflated the company’s revenue starting in 2009 to entice buyers, much of the trial consisted of witnesses being forced to recall business minutia, accounting decisions and conversations from as far back as 15 years ago. “I can’t give you a specific date for certain,” one former Autonomy employee said in early testimony. That sentiment was echoed throughout proceedings, with Lynch himself saying on the stand that it was “surreal” to watch “a parade of witnesses [he’s] never met” describe decisions in which he had no involvement. Lynch’s team has alleged the trial is unfair Court proceedings became contentious at some points, with Lynch’s defense team at one point moving for a mistrial based on “egregious” and “highly improper” prosecutorial conduct. In that line of questioning, which the defense said was “infected with deliberate misconduct highly prejudicial to Dr Lynch”, prosecutors indirectly implied that Lynch had been extradited for the proceedings. The only way for Lynch to address such references, the defense argued, would be to discuss post-acquisition events – which the judge has precluded. This effectively “hamstr[u]ng his fundamental rights to a fair trial”, the motion stated. Breyer denied the motion to dismiss, but acknowledged the prosecution’s questions were improper and ordered the jury to exclude the questions and subsequent testimony from their deliberation. Such language from the defense echoes rhetoric used in the UK trial of Autonomy executive Sushovan Hussain, whose attorneys called Hewlett-Packard’s case “exaggerated” and “unfair”. Hussain was separately convicted in 2018 at a trial in the same court on charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud related to the deal with HP. He was released from US prison in January after serving a five-year sentence. Lynch argues that this is all just a big misunderstanding of accounting differences between the UK and the US Cultural, linguistic and business differences between the US and the UK emerged as points of contention throughout the 12-week trial. Some cultural exchanges were comical in nature – Lynch explaining Britishisms to the jury, including his use of the term “bean counters” to reference accountants in one business missive. Others were more consequential, with the differences between US and UK accounting standards key to Lynch’s defense. Prosecutors called Ganesh Vaidyanathan, a former accounting director at Autonomy in the US, as a witness, who testified about potential accounting issues he first raised inside the company in 2010. However, during their cross-examination of Vaidyanathan, defense attorneys sought to highlight the differences between international financial reporting standards (IFRS), which were in use at Autonomy, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the financial reporting standards largely used for US-based companies. Lynch’s team has long argued that the case is a “dispute over differences between UK and US accounting systems” and “certain business judgments”, and not deliberate fraud.

        "title": "Is the British Gas boss really worth £8.2m? | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "There was much huffing, and a 35% rebellion by shareholders, when AstraZeneca proposed a pay packet for its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, of £18.7m if the company hits its performance targets. The case for the defence was that the pharma firm is a very large company – the biggest in the FTSE 100 index – and has to compete for executives in the US, land of the over-remunerated. Whether or not you’re convinced by the argument, it feels odd that £8.2m last year for Chris O’Shea, boss of Centrica, owner of British Gas, looks likely to fly through with minimal fuss at Wednesday’s annual meeting. Both the main proxy voting agencies are recommending a thumbs up, and they tend to set the mood. Yes, £8.2m is obviously a substantially smaller sum than £18.7m but Centrica is less than a 20th of the size of AstraZeneca in terms of stock market capitalisation: £7.5bn plays £190bn. Nor does the energy company need to nod to US pay norms since all its main assets these days are at home – the North Sea gasfields, the 20% stake in British Energy’s nuclear power station fleet and British Gas itself. O’Shea is seen to have done a good job, it should be said, if one looks beyond the appalling episode with British Gas-appointed prepayment meter fitters (for which he was docked a few quid from his bonus). He inherited a mess in 2020 from his unlamented predecessor, Iain Conn, and made a few strategic calls that were demonstrably correct – reversing the idea to sell the stake in British Energy, for example, and clearing out of a layer of management. Yet it is also plainly true that a chunk of the recovery in the share price from a bombed-out 30p in April 2020 to 142p today has been driven by a factor entirely beyond management’s control: the surge in wholesale energy prices that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. British Gas wasn’t helped particularly, but a rocket was put under returns from the North Sea fields and the nuclear plants. You can see the effect in the targets set for O’Shea’s bonus for 2023. The earnings per share measure was reset in the middle of year because of “materially better than expected” market conditions, but Centrica still beat the revised targets by a mile. On cashflow, the company exceeded its target by an almighty £1.5bn, which merely demonstrates how much volatility can occur in a commodity-based business. Management may have managed brilliantly, but outside forces had an outsized impact on the numbers. The tale of targets exceeded by wide margins was the same in 2022, which was why the biggest contributor to O’Shea’s £8.2m pay packet for 2023 was the £5.9m from the three-year incentive plan set at the start of 2021, another age in terms of energy prices. The timing is not O’Shea’s fault, of course, and no long-term investor is going to grumble about a trebling in the share price over the course of the scheme, the factor that has inflated the value of his incentives. But one hopes some shareholder at the annual meeting asks Carol Arrowsmith, chair of the remuneration committee, to explain this line in her report: “The committee considered whether there have been any windfall gains and determined there were none.” Really? None? Surely O’Shea was nearer the mark when he said, when he got a mere £4.5m for 2022, that his rewards are “impossible to justify”. He’s done well to restore much-needed stability to Centrica, but £12.7m over two years is a helluva tally for running what is, even after the share price whoosh, only the 55th largest company in the Footsie.",

        "content": "By now it should be no surprise that young Australians are doing it tough. In the post-Covid era, as the cost-of-living crisis tightens its grip on the nation, intergenerational wealth inequality has significantly worsened, and today’s young Australians are now poised to be the first generation worse off than their parents. A recent study into the spending habits of young people confirms how stark the divide has become. The CommBank iQ Cost of Living Insights report reveals Australians in their mid-to-late 20s have dramatically cut back their spending compared with last year – far more than any other age group. Meanwhile, those over 65 are spending at rates surpassing inflation on travel, retail and eating out, cutting back only on charitable donations. This economic disparity is now well-documented. Last year, both qualitative and quantitative evidence showed young people were not only forgoing discretionary items such as dining out or concerts but also cutting back on essentials such as food, fuel, utilities and insurance. Many younger Australians have also taken more financial actions to rein in spending such as negotiating bills and postponing major purchases. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup According to the CommBank report, those aged 25-29 have reduced spending even further, making them the only age group to cut back on both essentials and non-essentials. The repeated cutting back on essentials reflects a reduction in quality of life for young Australians, indicating they are at risk of a poorer future. This trend seems to be a compounding one, with the RBA’s policies to curb inflation by lifting interest rates punishing younger people, while allowing older people to enjoy higher asset values and bigger returns on savings. It’s not surprising then that older Australians are able to spend above the inflation rate, thereby counteracting efforts to cool the economy and further disadvantaging younger generations. What makes this economic disparity particularly damning is that it is not the only front where young people are getting the short end of the stick. Yes, all generations feel some economic pain in the early years of their work life but what sets today’s youth apart is the cumulative effect of multiple crises. Late millennials and early Gen Z were significantly affected by Covid during their formative years. It is the same cohort that entered and competed in a crippled job market filled with insecure work and disposable labour, a welfare system designed to maintain low wages and a housing system aimed at generating income for investors and landlords rather than providing affordable housing. This has stretched their transition to adulthood, delaying important markers like a stable job, home and family. They are ‘younger for longer’ – shallow in resources and in prospects. Continuous stress during impressionable years (18-29) can have a lasting impact, shaping the social and political outlook of a generation. And the negative effects go beyond finances. A widening intergenerational wealth gap may affect the ambitions, aspirations and wellbeing of future generations. In the UK last year two-thirds of 18-24-year-olds had lowered their career expectations, while in Australia a similar amount abandoned dreams and ambitions due to the cost-of-living crisis and mental health concerns. Changes in financial stress are closely linked to life satisfaction, psychological distress and confidence in the country’s direction. This year’s leap in money-related stress coincides with a decline in confidence in the government and a drop in overall satisfaction with the direction of the country, an ANU study found. The most dramatic sentiment change was in the proportion of Australians who believed owning a home was part of the Australian way of life. The national average dropped from 74.9% in April 2017 to 65.8% in January 2024. The youngest age group, 18-24, saw the greatest decline (from 62.2% to 49.5%), and those aged 25-34 also saw a similar significant drop (from 64.6% to 52.4%). If such feelings and attitudes persist – especially as young people are gradually priced out of the housing market and struggle to find secure, affordable housing – we will see inequality-driven social cleavages destabilising society and politics for years to come. We are at a risk of a generation that permanently thinks and acts as though the system is rigged against them. Continuous financial stress and inequitable handling are robbing young people of a fair chance, an equal opportunity – a fair go. These setbacks make it much harder for young people to secure a future – something their parents did not have to struggle as long to achieve. Young Australians are struggling but improving their lives doesn’t have to come at the expense of older generations. Thinking of it as a finite pie will only fuel intergenerational hostility and further threaten the intergenerational bargain.

        "title": "UK clothing sales to EU plummet as Brexit red tape deters exporters",
        "content": "UK exports of clothing and footwear to the EU have dived since Brexit, according to a new study that shows the extent to which complex regulations and red tape at the border have deterred firms from sending goods across the Channel. Exports of clothing and footwear sold to EU countries have fallen from £7.4bn in 2019 to £2.7bn in 2023, helping fuel an 18% slump in sales of all non-food goods exports to countries covered by the EU single market, according to the consultancy Retail Economics and online marketplace Tradebyte. The report said the decline meant British brands and retailers have seen sales to the EU plummet since Brexit, despite a flourishing European e-commerce market. The only sectors to increase export sales over the same period were health and beauty, and DIY and gardening, offsetting some of the fall from clothing and footwear. Many of the worst affected were small and medium-sized businesses, which faced a larger relative burden from red tape than multinational firms. One of the report’s authors, Richard Lim, head of Retail Economics, said some of the fall was simply down to a change in trade routes. UK firms that previously repackaged imports of goods made in Asia for sale in the EU have now reorganised their supply chains, by setting up offices inside the single market to bypass border regulations. However, red tape has forced many producers making apparel in the UK to move manufacturing to an EU country, at a cost to UK skills and jobs. In one instance a sock-maker based in Leicester, which declined to be named, has shifted production to Italy, ending more than 100 years of manufacturing in the east Midlands, Lim said. The UK has also failed to benefit from a boom in online goods sales in the EU since 2019, the authors suggest. “Online retail is estimated to add £323bn of annual sales to EU economies, but additional trade frictions caused by Brexit-related complexities are curtailing this international sales opportunity for UK-based brands and retailers,” the reportstated. Lim said: “It is a huge opportunity for UK brands that is not being grabbed.” He said the fall in the value of trade with the EU was softened by last year’s spike in inflation, which increased the cost of goods for export. A separate report on Tuesday by the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe found that while exports of goods had declined, services exports had increased by nearly 30% compared with February 2020. It said analysis of recent official figures showed that the UK’s services trade “has not only bounced back swiftly after the pandemic, but also exceeded pre-pandemic levels by the latter half of 2022”. It added: “This growth has been driven by ‘a boom’ in the UK’s trade in business services. This sector, which includes legal services and consultancies, has now overtaken manufacturing and transport equipment (including cars) to be the UK’s largest export sector.” The UK’s exports of services had remained resilient over the period 2020 to 2023 while services exports by France and Germany had declined. Why UK services firms had increased sales when they were largely unaffected by Brexit rule changes, was unclear, the report said. Rain Newton-Smith, head of the CBI, said there was a case to review the UK’s trading relationship as she set out the business lobby group’s wishlist ahead of the 4 July general election. Newton-Smith called for a “bold pitch” to international investors and said Britain and the EU should use a review of their trade deal in 2026. “That will be a moment for us to think about how do we improve and how do we minimise some of those trading frictions that are having an impact on business,” she told Bloomberg. Labour leader Keir Starmer has said he will align with the EU on food and agricultural products if he becomes prime minister. But he has ruled out rejoining the single market or allowing freedom of movement between Britain and the EU.",

        "title": "Asda now the most expensive UK supermarket to buy fuel, study shows",
        "content": "Asda is now the UK’s most expensive supermarket fuel seller, research shows, after the retailer’s private owners ditched its long-held pledge to be the cheapest on the market. The retailer, which was bought by the billionaire Issa brothers and their private equity partner TDR Capital in 2021, charged an average 2.1p a litre more for unleaded petrol than rivals Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons at the end of May, according to an analysis by the RAC motoring organisation. The difference in average diesel prices was even steeper, at 2.5p a litre, according to the study using data gathered by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) which has been closely monitoring fuel prices in an effort to ensure motorists are not being ripped off. The Issa brothers made their fortune from petrol forecourts. After acquiring Asda they folded part of their forecourts business, EG Group, into the supermarket chain. At the time of the deal in May 2023, Mohsin Issa said it would enable him to offer “Asda’s highly competitive fuel” to more customers. The RAC said that for many years Asda “prided itself on selling the cheapest fuel”, often being the first supermarket to cut pump prices. The RAC’s senior policy officer, Rod Dennis, said: “Asda no longer holds the crown for selling the cheapest fuel despite the pledge made when it was subject to a merger a year ago. “The other three major supermarkets, as well as some enterprising independents, now offer lower prices.” Asda said it was still the cheapest fuel retailer at its large supermarket outlets but admitted it charged higher prices at its convenience stores, where the market was different. It said that if those smaller outlets were excluded Asda offered unleaded fuel at an average price of 145.12p compared with the next cheapest supermarket which it said was Morrisons on 145.17p while Tesco supermarkets sold fuel for an average 145.52p. An Asda spokesperson said: “We remain focused on providing our customers with the best value at the pumps as we grow in the convenience sector. In May, we reduced the price of unleaded and diesel by a combined average of 2.31p per litre.” The CMA, which last month gained the power to monitor the fuel market and report malpractice to the government, published a report in July last year stating that Asda’s target fuel margin – the difference between what it paid for fuel and the pump price – was three times higher in 2023 than it had been in 2019. In January, TDR Capital managing director Gary Lindsay told the House of Commons’ business and trade committee that Asda did not have “a particular strategy to bump the price of fuel or to make a larger profit on fuel”. The RAC analysis found that across all UK forecourts, the price of petrol fell by an average 2.4p a litre last month to 147.9p. Diesel prices dipped by 4.5p a litre to 153.6p. Dennis said pump prices should be falling much faster to reflect a decline in wholesale costs. He said: “When it comes to much-needed pump price cuts, it’s sadly a case of too little too leisurely, with most drivers still getting a miserable deal every time they fill up. We’re once again in classic ‘rocket and feather’ territory, with pump prices only trickling down when they should really be falling like a stone.”",

        "title": "Scandinavia ‘way ahead’ of UK in telecoms infrastructure, says BT boss",
        "content": "The Nordic countries are “way ahead” of the UK in telecoms infrastructure and the government should look again at planning laws to help improve poor connectivity, the boss of BT has said. Allison Kirkby, the chief executive of BT, told the Deloitte and Enders media and telecoms conference in London: “What I would say is Scandinavia is way ahead of the UK. Part of that is very much driven by the regulatory environment, the planning environment and the general adoption of digital skills and digital services.” About 80% of homes in Sweden are connected by entirely fibre-optic lines, she said, which are many times faster than older copper wires. She joined BT earlier this year from her former role as the chief executive of the Swedish telecoms company Telia, and has spent the past decade working in Scandinavia. She faces a tough turnaround at BT, which is fighting competition from scores of alternative network providers, or “alt nets”, as it rolls out next-generation 5G mobile and full-fibre broadband across the UK through its Openreach subsidiary. BT has set itself a £15bn plan to roll out full-fibre broadband to 25m homes by 2026. It has reached more than 14m premises, with a further 6m where initial build is under way, and is on track to reach 25m by December 2026. Kirkby was asked at the conference what she was looking for from the government in a general election year, and replied: “Regulatory and fiscal policy certainty.” “We need to look at planning,” she said. “It’s not necessarily market structure that stops the UK having the great networks that I saw in Sweden – a lot of it is restricted by planning. The Swedes, the Norwegians, the Finnish all expected their highways, their trains, to have great connectivity wherever you were, even when you were up in the northern part of the country. A lot of what is not working in the UK is the planning legislation.” Separately Robert Finnegan, the chief executive of mobile phone company Three UK, told the London conference that in his view, “customers would be short-changed” and see less infrastructure investment if the Competition and Markets Authority was to block the proposed merger between Three UK and Vodafone. Finnegan said: “Well if this merger does not get approved, then nothing changes and the UK will still rank lowly amongst its peers … because people want quality infrastructure when they are investing … Customers will be short-changed … the two smaller players won’t be able to afford to roll out the network and the two big players won’t have the incentive to do so.”",

        "title": "UK faces £33bn hole in finances or return to austerity, thinktank says",
        "content": "Britain’s next government will need to fill a shortfall of up to £33bn in the public finances unless it is prepared to push through a fresh round of severe austerity measures, a thinktank has warned. The Resolution Foundation said the debate between Labour and the Conservatives over the funding of specific pledges was “detached from reality”, with election promises based on cuts that would be hard to deliver. The thinktank said both the main parties were committed to reducing debt as a share of national income within five years but higher interest payments on debts, slower-than-expected productivity growth and the £10bn cost of compensation for the infected blood scandal would make that more difficult. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s tax and spending watchdog, has estimated that the government is on course to meet its debt-to-GDP target with just £9bn to spare, but the Resolution Foundation said the winning party in the general election would face the choice of raising taxes or cutting spending to meet its debt target. The thinktank said if the next government stuck to current spending plans the size of the deficit was likely to be about £12bn, but if it chose to spare prisons, the police and local government from fresh cuts, it could be as big as £33bn. In its annual health check on the UK economy last month, the International Monetary Fund warned of a £30bn post-election hole. James Smith, the Resolution Foundation’s research director, said: “The state of the public finances has dominated the election campaign so far, with the inevitable arguments over how each spending pledge is funded. But this narrow focus risks distracting the electorate from the bigger question of how each party would manage the uncertainties facing the public finances. “This question is crucial, as whoever wins the election could be confronting a fiscal hole of £12bn, if today’s uncertainties turn into bad news after the election. And if the next government wants to avoid a fresh round of austerity, that black hole could rise to over £33bn.” The budgets for NHS England, education, defence and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office are ringfenced, but this would result in inflation-adjusted, per-person spending cuts to unprotected departments – such as justice, the Home Office and local government – of 13% between 2024-25 and 2028-29. Cuts on this scale – equivalent to £19bn – would amount to repeating nearly three-quarters of the cuts made during the 2010-2015 parliament. “Delivering these cuts in the face of already crumbling public services and the public desire for more, not less, spending on public services would likely prove very challenging,” the Resolution Foundation said. While the stated aim of both parties was to get debt falling, the next government could be on course to miss this target by more than £30bn. History and politics had left the fiscal debate “detached from this reality”, it added.",

BA is also upgrading some of its computers and other technology at Heathrow. In Germany, unemployment rose more than expected last month, reinforcing the view that Europe’s biggest economy will recover only gradually this year. Joblessness rose by a seasonally adjusted 25,000 in May, compared to expectations of a gain of just 7,000. The unemployment rate held at 5.9%, the Federal Labor Agency said today. “The spring recovery did not really get going this year,” said labour office head Andrea Nahles. “Improvement is still a long time coming.” Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Take care – JK European gas prices eased after news that an outage affecting Norway’s gas exports to Britain that sent prices soaring yesterday will likely be repaired by Friday. The news eased supply crunch concerns, but the outage was a fresh reminder of Europe’s dependence on Norwegian gas. Europe’s benchmark gas price, the Dutch front-month contract , fell 4% to €34.93 per mega watt hour. The outage drove up European gas prices yesterday to a peak of €38.56, their highest level since December. Gassco, the Norwegian state owned company, attributed it to a crack in a two-inch pipeline onboard Equinor’s offshore Sleipner Riser platform. Oil prices slid by 2%, with Brent falling by $1.52 to $76.84 while US light crude dropped by the same amount to $72.70. Opec+ nations (the oil cartel and allies led by Russia) revealed on Sunday that they would gradually phase out production cuts after September. Whistleblowers have claimed Standard Chartered allegedly carried out billions of dollars of previously undetected transactions for Iran-linked entities and terrorist organisations, according to a New York court filing. Two whistleblowers, who include a former executive at the British bank, filed a motion last week to set aside a judgment that dismissed an earlier lawsuit they filed, in an attempt to revive their efforts. The two men, who run Brutus Trading, which was formed to pursue their claim, said in court papers that their lawsuit should be reinstated after they used forensic data analysis to “decloak” information “hidden deep in the bank’s electronic spreadsheets”. The data was provided by Brutus to US authorities in 2012 and 2013 and the whistleblowers claim it shows “countless illegal transactions” by the bank. Standard Chartered denies the allegations. The whistleblowers – Julian Knight, a former global head of foreign exchange transaction banking who left Standard Chartered in 2011, and Robert Marcellus, a currency trader – were helped by the forensic investigator David Scantling, who began examining the data, and worked together to reveal “transactions that were hidden”, the court documents claim. By February 2024, the men alleged they had “identified over 3.3m previously undisclosed transactional records, of which 500,000 documented unique transactions spanning from 2008 to 2013”. The court documents said that the data showed 20,000 foreign exchange transactions related to Iran that took place between 2008 and 2013 and had a cumulative notional value of $100bn (£78bn). “The decloaked … data definitely shows that – long after the bank supposedly discontinued its Iranian operations in 2007 – SCB [Standard Chartered Bank] facilitated many billions of dollars in banking transactions for Iran, numerous international terror groups and the front companies for those groups,” the court papers filed by the two whistleblowers to New York’s southern district court last week allege. British Airways is hiring 350 additional staff at Heathrow in London to avoid the summer airport chaos seen two years ago. The carrier, owned by IAG, expects this summer to be its busiest since the pandemic and will hire about 350 new workers in customer services and ground handling, Bloomberg News reported, citing a spokesperson for the airline. BA is also upgrading some of its computers and other technology at Heathrow. The airline is hiring as part of a major transformation plan under chief executive Sean Doyle. Like other carriers, it laid off thousands of staff during the pandemic and struggled to rehire when travel bounced back in recent years, while its IT systems have also repeatedly failed at busy times. While BA is building a new IT system, the upgrade will not be fully rolled out by this summer so the extra staff are needed to ensure operations run smoothly. Our retail correspondent Sarah Butler has interviewed the boss of the casual clothing brand White Stuff, Jo Jenkins, who says she’s “just getting going” and hopes to tap into midlife trends and mature shoppers -- which involves attracting 50somethings to its colourful dresses and quirky knitwear like hot pink bobble jumpers, for example. Here is our full story on the homelessness charity Noble Tree Foundation entering administration after a long dispute with its property fund landlord Home Reit. Noble Tree has been withholding rent from Home Reit, some of whose homes it claimed were “unfit to live in”. Fewer British companies were taken over by foreign firms between January and March, according to official figures –- but this precedes a flurry of foreign takeover interest in London-listed firms including Royal Mail and the miner Anglo American. There were 144 completed takeovers of UK companies in the first quarter, down from 171 in the previous quarter and 184 in the year-earlier period, the Office for National Statistics said. The total value of inward merger deals, where overseas businesses acquire British firms, declined by 39% to £6.1bn, the lowest figure since late 2020. However, there are some big deals to come. Royal Mail is in the process of being sold to the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský, with the postal services owner agreeing terms and conditions on a £3.57bn offer last Wednesday. Meanwhile, Australia’s BHP walked away from its pursuit of Anglo American on the same day. BHP, which had proposed paying almost £39bn for Anglo American, gave up after failing to persuade its rival miner to accept a takeover offer or extend talks. In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, unemployment has risen more than expected. Joblessness rose by a seasonally adjusted 25,000 in May, compared to expectations of a gain of just 7,000. The unemployment rate held at 5.9%, the Federal Labor Agency said today. German economics journalist Holger Zschäpitz said: British American Tobacco, the maker of Lucky Strike and Dunhill cigarettes, has warned that dwindling cigarette sales in the US and the surge of illegal disposable vapes could lead to lower sales and profits. Despite some early signs of economic recovery, Americans “remain stretched” and cigarette sales across the US industry are down 9% so far this year, according to BAT. The company expects its revenues and adjusted profit from operations for the first half of the year to be down by low single digits compared to a year earlier. Tadeu Marocco, the chief executive, said: Our guidance also reflects ongoing macro-economic pressures, particularly in the US market and continued lack of effective enforcement against the growing illicit vapour segment. However, BAT expects sales to improve during the second half, resulting in a slight increase in sales and adjusted profits in 2024. The company received a boon when Rishi Sunak’s anti-smoking plans were put on hold due to the 4 July election. The tobacco and vapes bill, intended to create a ‘smokefree generation’, is one of several laws that won’t make it before the election. It aims to prevent anyone born after 2009 from legally smoking, gradually raising the minimum age every year. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Darren Nathan said: British American Tobacco’s trading update noted that combustible volumes in the US were down a hefty 9%. Nonetheless, underlying full-year growth guidance for low-single-digit revenue and adjusted profit from operations growth remains unchanged. This will be second-half weighted, so there’s an element of wait-and-see in terms of new product launches and US commercial initiatives. A strong performance from brands such as Lucky Strike is helping to gain volume share in the US and other territories. Meanwhile, the emphasis in new categories such as vapes is moving from revenue to profit growth, but the use of illicit single-use vapes in the States remains a problem and the group has called for stronger enforcement of regulation. This year, global tobacco industry volumes are expected to fall 3% from last year. A homelessness charity has gone into administration following a lengthy standoff with its property fund landlord where it refused to pay rent over the condition of its properties, some of which had black mould and leaking ceilings. Home Reit, a London-listed real estate investment trust, has been in dispute for more than a year with Noble Tree Foundation which is a tenant of 143 properties in its portfolio after complaints about property repairs. Home Reit, whose shares were suspended last year, said in a stock exchange statement that Noble Tree Foundation, which represents 7% of rent demanded in April, has entered into administration and was not paying rent. The charity had withheld several months’ rent from Home Reit and last year told the Guardian that it was owed millions of pounds for repairs and insurance that have not been forthcoming. The Charity Commission launched a statutory inquiry into Noble Tree last October over alleged conflict of interest and related party transactions. Homes leased by Noble Tree are let to private rented sector tenants and following the surrender of Noble Tree’s leases, the tenancies will transfer to itself so it can collect income from the properties. UK and European shares are in the red, while oil prices are extending losses as investors expect more supply later in the year. The FTSE 100 index in London is down 34 points, or 0.4%, while Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC have both lost around 0.3% and Italy’s FTSE MiB has fallen nearly 0.7%. Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The markets barely blinked at yesterday’s political turmoil, and with just one month to go before the UK electorate heads to the polls, the FTSE 100 opened just a fraction down… The Conservative party’s faltering general election campaign suffered a potentially damaging blow when Nigel Farage announced he intended to stand as an MP and lead the Reform party for the next five years. The former Ukip and Brexit party leader said he would stand in Clacton, Essex, after changing his mind while spending time on the campaign trail. He claimed that he did not want to let his supporters down. Farage will also take over as leader of Reform UK from Richard Tice, pledging to stay in post for a full parliamentary term. Nathan added: Brent crude is down… to under $78 per barrel following prices cratering to four-month lows yesterday, after Opec+ nations revealed they would gradually phase out production cuts after September. This, and the weaker economic data seen both sides of the pond, may provide some comfort for those on rate-setting committees hoping for an earlier cut to borrowing costs. Meme stocks have been in the spotlight again, after a post by social media influencer “Roaring Kitty” suggested he had taken a significant position in GameStop. The shares were up as much as 75% over the day but closed up just 21%. This highlights the extreme volatility and risk in trying to catch the timing of these rallies which have no financial substance behind them. Brent crude has fallen 1.1%, or 88 cents, to $77.48 a barrel, while US light crude has lost 1.5%, or $1.09, to $73.14 a barrel. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and allies led by Russia, a group known as Opec+, on Sunday agreed to extend most of their oil output cuts into 2025 –- but left rom for voluntary cuts from eight members to be gradually unwound from October. Airbus is negotiating a major sales of more than 100 wide-body A330neo jets to China, with talks gaining momentum since president Xi Jinping visited his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron last month, Bloomberg News reported. Some of the biggest Chinese airlines are considering buying the upgraded A330 models. The terms are still being discussed and the timing is uncertain. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Vistry Group, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, is to sell a portfolio of 1,750 new build homes to the private equity firms Blackstone Real Estate and Regis Group in a £580m deal. The portfolio will be managed by the private rented housing firm Leaf Living, which is backed by funds managed by Blackstone and Regis. The portfolio, which is concentrated in the south-east of England, consists of 1,750 homes across 36 Vistry developments. The first completions are expected by the end of June, with the majority of homes expected to complete within the next two years. Vistry is in the process of selling off properties from its housebuilding division as the company moves towards focusing on its partnerships business, which builds affordable housing for government and non-profit partners. Greg Fitzgerald, chief executive of Vistry, formerly known as Bovis Homes, said: By working in partnership with organisations like Leaf Living we can maximise the number of high-quality homes we deliver every year. This agreement supports our differentiated business model, with the certainty provided by the pre-selling of homes enabling us to accelerate our build programmes, guarantee work for our supply chain, reduce sales and build costs and create vibrant new communities. This year we are on track to deliver more than a 10% increase in new home completions, playing a key part in helping to address the UK’s acute housing shortage. Blackstone has been investing in UK residential property and acquired 2,915 homes for £819m from Vistry in November. James Seppala, head of European real estate at the firm, said: Institutional private capital can play an important role in providing high quality housing stock across the UK, particularly in the private rented sector which is significantly undersupplied today. Partnerships such as these can meaningfully accelerate the delivery of new homes and help alleviate structural undersupply across the sector. Retail sales in the UK eked out modest growth last month, despite a strong bank holiday weekend for retailers. Sales grew by 0.7% year on year in May, against growth of 3.9% in May last year, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Food sales growth slowed to 3.% year on year in the three months to May from 9.6% a year ago. Non-food sales declined by 2.4%, against growth of 0.7% a year ago. Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said: Despite a strong bank holiday weekend for retailers, minimal improvement to weather across most of May meant only a modest rebound in retail sales last month. Although non-food sales fell over the course of the month, the long weekend did see increased purchases of DIY and gardening equipment, as well as strong clothing sales. Growth in computing sales reached their highest levels since the pandemic, with many consumers continuing to upgrade tech bought during that period. Retailers remain optimistic that major events such as the Euros and the Olympics will bolster consumer confidence this summer. 8.55am BST: Germany unemployment for May 9.30am BST: UK Mergers &amp; acquisitions 10am BST: Former Post Office finance chief Chris Day to testify in Horizon inquiry 3pm BST: US Factory Orders for April",

In a declaration by Scantling lodged with the court, the investigator states that, as well as identifying 3.3m previously undisclosed transactional records, he had “further isolated 906 Iranian-related transactions” between January 2008 and March 2012 which totalled $9.6bn and involved “entities and individuals subject to international sanctions”. He claimed the newly extracted data included numerous Standard Chartered transactions “with and on behalf of Iranian banks, Iranian companies and Middle Eastern money exchanges” that according to the US government “finance designated foreign terrorist organisations” such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Taliban. The two whistleblowers also allege that the US government committed a “colossal fraud” on the court when it failed to provide evidence to help enforcement action against the bank for violating global sanctions. Standard Chartered said in a statement: “This filing is another attempt to use fabricated claims against the bank, following previous unsuccessful attempts. “The false allegations underpinning it have been thoroughly discredited by the US authorities who undertook a comprehensive investigation into the claims and said they were ‘meritless’ and did not show any violations of US sanctions. We are confident the courts will reject these claims, as they have already done repeatedly.” The UK government, including the then chancellor George Osborne, intervened with US government on the bank’s behalf in 2012 when the scandal first emerged. The bank admitted breaching sanctions against Iran and other countries – first in 2012 and then in 2019 – paying $1.7bn of fines to regulators, but it has never admitted conducting transactions for terrorist organisations.",

        "content": "‘I’m just getting going,” says Jo Jenkins, the 55-year-old boss of casual clothing brand White Stuff. Founded by two ski bums selling T-shirts door-to-door in the Alps, it has grown up with its customers and is now a supplier of floral tunics, utility jackets and other everyday staples to mums and dads. Jenkins, a polished retail industry veteran, was poached from Marks &amp; Spencer in 2017 to help get White Stuff back on piste. Known for its colourful prints and comfy fits, the retailer had slumped to a loss amid the rise of online shopping and some fashion faux pas. Since joining, she has steered the company through some big storms. It survived the pandemic, while rivals Joules, FatFace and Cath Kidston faced financial difficulties, and returned to profitability in 2022, becoming a hit with Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Next shoppers. All three high street giants have adopted a department store model online, with websites selling their own and other brands, and White Stuff is in each of their virtual storefronts. On the bricks-and-mortar high street, it has 114 shops and 46 concessions in the UK and 28 shops and concessions in Germany as well as 575 wholesale stockists worldwide. There have been rumours that founders George Treves and Sean Thomas are considering selling up as the brand expands. There are plans for up to 30 more standalone stores over five years, while the number of M&amp;S outlets in which the brand is sold is doubling to 20. Jenkins also wants to expand the accessories, footwear and men’s ranges. The deal with M&amp;S brings Jenkins full circle back to the company where she started as a “Saturday girl”, and then a management trainee straight from A-levels, before returning many years later, after a long stint at Next, to become beauty and clothing director. By teaming up with bigger names, White Stuff believes it has found a way to connect with its core fiftysomething customer. It’s a demographic that is underserved by retailers, despite being one of the few spending more on fashion in these straitened times. Jenkins says the market is ripe for new ideas, as what are now referred to as “mid-lifers” are reassessing where to shop after the closure of so many of the department stores they would have turned to in the past. That generation are also becoming more engaged and savvy about social media, looking at TikTok and Instagram as well as old favourites such as Facebook for ideas. “By the age of 50, I think people are more confident in what they are happy to wear and know what they’re looking for. Our unique, more independent point of view on style appeals to that customer who is just looking for something a bit different and not wanting to follow the pack, the usual fashion trends, and be a slave to what we read and see, and every other image,” says Jenkins. “These are women and men that still want to express themselves through style, still have a desire to spend money and enjoy clothing. And I think this is a great opportunity. It is the best part of the clothing sector in a tough market.” As a stylish and savvy mid-lifer herself, Jenkins embodies the customer she is trying to serve. “What’s 50 today? It’s nothing, is it? I feel like I am just getting going and embracing the next chapter in my life.” While the UK fashion industry has suffered a difficult period, with a warm autumn and then a chilly wet spring, White Stuff has continued to grow, benefiting from improvements in style, new routes to market and steady income from good-quality basics such as chinos and cardigans, which are less dependent on the seasons. The brand, which employs more than 1,200 people, increased sales by 13% to £151m in the year to April 2023, although pre-tax profits fell last year to £47,000 from £8.3m the year before as costs rose. This year, the group is expecting growth in full-price sales and profit. Sales in April were up 12% on last year. It has already travelled a long way from its roots. Founded in 1985 by catering student Treves and his friend Thomas, a tour operator and handyman, the pair first sold their “Boys from the White Stuff” T-shirts out of a suitcase in upmarket resorts such as Méribel and Val d’Isère to pay for their skiing habit. They opened their first store in Clapham, south London, in 1991 and launched a catalogue. They continued to design product themselves until the early 00s, before hiring a professional manager, Sally Bailey, from Miss Selfridge. Bailey developed the brand to appeal to a more urban audience and shifted into womenswear to embrace a fast-growing market. These days, Jenkins believes White Stuff is doing well because it has stuck to the standards its shoppers expect. “We’ve never lost sight of the detail and the quality, and I think it’s that that has kept us just slightly ahead of the game,” she says. Sales of the group’s colourful dresses are up by a quarter, while its “quirky” knitwear – think hot pink bobble jumpers – is also enjoying a moment. “It’s not an easy backdrop, for sure, and I do feel like you have to work very hard for every pound.” Jenkins says. “But our product has just hit it right.

        "title": "Homelessness charity enters administration after dispute with property fund landlord",
        "content": "A homelessness charity has gone into administration after a lengthy standoff with its property fund landlord in which it refused to pay rent over the condition of its properties, some of which had black mould and leaking ceilings. Home Reit, a London-listed real estate investment trust, has been in dispute for more than a year with Noble Tree Foundation, which leases 143 properties from the trust’s portfolio, after complaints about property repairs. Home Reit, whose shares were suspended last year, said in a stock exchange statement that Noble Tree Foundation, which represents 7% of rent demanded in April, has entered into administration and was not paying rent. The charity had withheld several months’ rent from Home Reit and last year claimedit was owed millions of pounds for repairs and insurance that have not been forthcoming. The charity said some properties were “unfit for people to live in” and issues included black mould and leaking ceilings. The Charity Commission launched a statutory inquiry into Noble Tree last October over alleged conflict of interest and related party transactions. Noble Tree has been contacted for comment. Home Reit was established in 2020 as a property fund tackling homelessness and had ambitions to grow into a £1bn business and take 10,000 people off the street. It had 1,920 properties leased to registered charities and housing associations on leases ranging from 20 to 30 years as of the end of April. Homes leased by Noble Tree are let to private rented sector tenants and, after the surrender of the charity’s leases, the tenancies will transfer to Home Reit so it can collect income from the properties. The company said it was working closely with Noble Tree’s appointed administrator, CBW Recovery, to arrange the surrender of the charity’s leases and a handover of its tenancies. The company said residents of the properties would not be affected. Home Reit said it would either re-let the properties to a social housing provider or appoint a property manager, which would be responsible for the day-to-day management and rent collection. CBW Recovery said that, after the presentation of a winding-up petition from one of the landlords, it had been approached by the trustees and the company was placed into administration. John Dickinson, an insolvency partner at CBW Recovery, said: “We are continuing to trade the charity whilst we work with the landlords to negotiate exits from leases and, hopefully, to then make a distribution to the unsecured creditors. We have previous experience in these situations and from initial discussions with the landlords, we are confident that a positive outcome can be reached.” Dickinson said CBW’s “absolute priority is maintaining the welfare and living conditions of the charity’s vulnerable tenants”. In May, Home Reit said it had agreed with another tenant, Big Help, for the surrender of its leases on more than 600 properties that the Liverpool-based charity had leased, equating to about 30% of the company’s portfolio by number of properties. These lease surrenders completed on 28 May. In a separate development, Vistry Group, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders formerly known as Bovis Homes, is to sell a portfolio of 1,750 new-build homes to the private equity firms Blackstone Real Estate and Regis Group in a £580m deal. The portfolio will be managed by the private rented housing firm Leaf Living, which is backed by funds managed by Blackstone and Regis. The portfolio, which is concentrated in the south-east of England, consists of 1,750 homes across 36 Vistry developments. The first completions are expected by the end of June, with the majority of homes expected to complete within the next two years. Vistry is in the process of selling off properties from its housebuilding division as the company moves towards focusing on its partnerships business, which builds affordable housing for government and non-profit partners.",

        "title": "PwC to face scrutiny over advice to clients that might allegedly ‘mislead or subvert’ foreign investment review board",
        "content": "The Greens senator Barbara Pocock has warned consultancy PwC Australia faces fresh scrutiny after the Australian Taxation Office revealed it had queried advice given to clients that might “mislead or subvert” foreign investment review board processes. The details were revealed in answers to questions Pocock put to the ATO about a meeting between the office commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn and the then PwC chief executive, Luke Sayers, in August 2019. At that meeting, Hirschhorn “advised” Sayers about concerns with PwC’s tax practice. These had followed a 2015 tax scandal that prompted regulators to bar PwC’s Peter Collins from advising for eight years after he was accused of sharing confidential government information about multinational tax avoidance with his colleagues. Among the issues raised was a concern about PwC’s “involvement in Foreign Investment Review Board approval processes on behalf of clients which, through omission and commission, had the potential to mislead or subvert those processes”, the ATO said. “These are serious and new allegations and need to be thoroughly investigated,” Pocock told Guardian Australia. The ATO’s responses come about a week before a Senate inquiry into consultants – led in part by Pocock – is due to release its final report on 12 June after a couple of extensions. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Pocock’s office said a separate inquiry into corporations led by Labor’s Deb O’Neill, might get a chance to investigate the ATO’s concerns more closely. Guardian Australia sought comment from PwC and the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, who oversees the foreign investment review board. In its response to Pocock, the ATO also said it had raised concerns with PwC about it “assisting clients in the preparation of responses to Request for Information (RFI) notices for clients, where material in those responses was false or misleading to the knowledge of the PwC staff involved”. The ATO also said that “Hirschhorn read out several representative PwC emails to Mr Sayers which had been previously provided to the ATO by PwC”. Pocock raised the issue about the emails in her questions to the Australian Investments and Securities Commission in Senate estimates on Tuesday. Noting Sayers was paid $30m over eight years, Pocock asked the Asic chair, Joe Longo: “Mr Luke Sayers’ constant response throughout this series of events is ‘I have no memory.’ How plausible do you think that position is?” “I’m not in a position to comment one way or the other as to who’s telling the truth,” Longo told Senate estimates. “But certainly, from my perspective on the face of it, it’s a very serious situation.”",

        "title": "Falling UK inflation not leading to rise in spending, report finds",
        "content": "Consumer spending growth is at its weakest in more than three years as higher council tax bills and the rising cost of broadband and mobile phones eat into household budgets, a report has said. The monthly snapshot of credit and debit card activity from Barclays found an improvement in consumer confidence as a result of falling inflation was not leading to a pickup in spending. The bank said April’s increases in the cost of essential items, coupled with another month of poor weather, meant card spending was just 1% higher in May than in the same month a year earlier. With households cutting back on takeaways as a means of saving money, May recorded the lowest spending growth since February 2021, when the economy was affected by Covid lockdown restrictions. A survey of 2,000 consumers conducted for Barclays showed 87% were concerned about the impact of rising household bills on their personal finances, with increasing council tax, broadband and mobile costs, water bills, and dental costs among the issues raised. Council tax bills rose by 5% on average in April, while broadband and mobile phone contracts increased by about 8%. Barclays said the fall in inflation – which hit 2.3% in April, down from a then 41-year high of 11.1% in October 2022 – would eventually boost activity. The survey found almost one in three consumers (28%) said they would spend more when the weather improved. Karen Johnson, the head of retail at Barclays, said: “Retailers faced a challenging May, yet the few sunnier days in the month did bring a welcome uptick in footfall. As consumers gear up to spend more with better weather, and with the Euros, Wimbledon, and Taylor Swift’s Eras tour on the horizon, there’s a brighter outlook for the coming months.” A separate survey from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG also highlighted the effect of the weather on consumer behaviour. The report showed retail spending in stores and online was 0.7% up on a year earlier, an improvement on April’s 4% annual decrease. Retailers are banking on sporting events such as the Olympics and the Euros to boost takings after a weak spring. Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said: “Despite a strong bank holiday weekend for retailers, minimal improvement to weather across most of May meant only a modest rebound in retail sales last month. “Although non-food sales fell over the course of the month, the long weekend did see increased purchases of DIY and gardening equipment, as well as strong clothing sales. Growth in computing sales reached their highest levels since the pandemic, with many consumers continuing to upgrade tech bought during that period.” Meanwhile, the monthly survey of industry from the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) and S&amp;P showed a return to growth for manufacturing in May, with output rising at its fastest pace in more than two years and business optimism improving. The CIPS/S&amp;P purchasing managers’ index rose from 49.1 in April to 51.2 in May. A reading above 50 indicates that the sector is expanding.",

        "title": " Book festival activists are making absurd demands over Baillie Gifford | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "In a ranking of climate villains in the fund management industry, Baillie Gifford would surely come a long way down most people’s list. The Edinburgh-based firm preaches long-termism and its specialism is backing technology companies, especially those with kit to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy and transport. It was early into Tesla on the thesis that polluting internal combustion engines are on the way out and Elon Musk had a winning electric design. Another high-profile bet was Northvolt, the Swedish pacesetter in batteries that is now the net zero envy of the rest of Europe. Few portfolios in the mainstream asset management world are entirely free of fossil fuel assets but Baillie Gifford’s are definitely at the less oily end. As the firm has pointed out repeatedly in recent weeks, only 1% of the £225bn of the assets it manages is invested directly in fossil fuel companies, and the figure is still only 2% if one includes stocks such as supermarkets that sell petrol. That’s versus an industry average of 11%. None of these details matter to a campaign group called Fossil Free Books. With the help of high-profile endorsements from the likes of the singer Charlotte Church and the comedian Nish Kumar, it has managed to bounce the organisers of the Hay festival and the Edinburgh international book festival into dropping Baillie Gifford as principal sponsor. For the activists, the fact that 1% to 2% adds up to the seemingly large number of £2.5bn-£5bn is all that matters – never mind that a single oil company, Shell, is worth almost £200bn, and never mind that Baillie Gifford is not free to divest because, as is normal, it manages to mandates set by its clients. For good measure, the campaigners added that Baillie Gifford should divest from companies with “links” to “Israeli occupation, apartheid and genocide”. On its radar, though, are firms including Amazon, the semiconductor group Nvidia, and Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, which are all among the world’s most widely held stocks as US tech is hard to escape in any diversified share portfolio, including (almost certainly) in the pension schemes of a large proportion of speakers and attendees at Hay and Edinburgh. Fossil Free Books, incidentally, has a “follow us on Instagram” invitation on its website even as it calls for divestment from the owner. One can also wonder why a group of “workers in the literary industry” didn’t start by pitching their demands closer to home. Waterstones and the US book chain Barnes &amp; Noble – two major employers of workers in the literary industry – are owned by New York-based hedge fund Elliott, whose commodities operation says it actively trades in “crude oil and oil products, natural gas” among other things. There hasn’t been a squeak from the campaigners on that front. Such examples merely underscore how the financial world is a complicated place. Divestment can play a role in shifting societal norms, as Baillie Gifford acknowledges, but it is not guaranteed to make a difference. In the case of oil companies, the tactic looks particularly pointless currently as the firms are generating more cash than they can deploy in their operations, which is why share buy-backs are happening across the sector. It is possible that none of the major firms will need to raise capital from shareholders ever again. To the extent their boards care about who owns their shares, they would probably prefer investors who are less interested in energy transition. Thankfully, somebody in the literary world can see what’s going on here. The environmental writer Mark Lynas, author of Our Final Warning: Six Degrees of Climate Emergency, wrote a sensible blog decrying the attacks on a “soft target” of Hay “in a campaign primarily relying on peer pressure and public moral intimidation, because the activists knew the festival management would have to give in”. As he says, not a penny will end up being disinvested, nor will any emissions be reduced. “All that’s happened is that literary festivals now have huge holes in their budgets which will mean they have to raise ticket prices (excluding those on lower incomes) or maybe go out of business. Who would risk sponsoring now, given what has happened?” Exactly right. The likely outcome from such extreme demands will be a decline in sponsorship for the arts. Yes, festivals should apply an ethical filter of some form, but an insistence on investment purity will only lead to a plunge in contributions. Boardrooms everywhere will now be assessing whether they should quietly not renew next year. The cause of climate activism will not be advanced when the demands are so absolute. Before the financing of arts festivals is completely wrecked, it would be useful if more authors dared to say so. Really, there isn’t a long queue of alternative liberal-minded sponsors out there.",
