        "title": "Tribunal cases to rise as UK firms push back on remote working, experts say",
        "content": "Lawyers and HR experts expect an increase in employment tribunal cases as companies increasingly clamp down on working from home and staff become resentful that the flexibility they have enjoyed since the Covid crisis is being slowly rolled back. A number of companies are now advocating a full five-day return to the office, with others enforcing a minimum number of days in the workplace. Administrative staff at Boots, who previously worked in the office three days a week, will return to the office five days a week from September. Many US banks, such as Goldman Sachs, also expect senior staff to come in for the full week, and its chief executive, David Solomon, labelled remote working an “aberration”. Lawyers say some employers have become emboldened after an employment tribunal earlier this year rejected the case of a senior manager who sued the City watchdog, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), because she wanted to work at home full-time. The employment judge Robert Richter ruled that the financial watchdog was within its rights to reject Elizabeth Wilson’s request. He said there were “weaknesses with remote working” and added that the case raised a key issue “which will no doubt be the subject of continued litigation”. Richard Fox, a partner at Keystone Law, said that while each tribunal claim would turn on its own facts, the FCA case was significant and closely watched. “The FCA case was not binding but employers have felt it is an important case to consider,” he said. “The issue is becoming a battleground and we advise employers to play it very carefully.” The HR consultancy Hamilton Nash said it expected the number of employment tribunals involving remote working to rise this year. Its analysis of past employment tribunal records shows that 42 tribunals mentioned remote working in 2022 – up 50% from the 27 cases in 2021. In the first half of 2023, there were 23 cases, it said. This compares with before the pandemic, when only six employment tribunal cases in 2019 cited working from home, rising to 16 cases in 2020. “I would expect more tribunal cases on working from home,” said Jim Moore, an employee relations expert at Hamilton Nash. “We’re seeing significant tensions between flexible working requests from people keen to secure their hybrid arrangements and employers pushing people back into the office.” Gemma Dale, a senior lecturer in the business school at Liverpool John Moores University, said the FCA case “was one of the few cases since the pandemic and there hasn’t been that much case law”. In some cases, business leaders were advocating a return to the office based on their personal views rather than by looking at data or academic studies on working from home, she said. She added: “The progress made on flexible working is quite fragile. The Homes Under the Hammer fallacy that everyone who is working from home is watching TV is still strong in some organisations.” A survey of chief executives by the accountancy firm KPMG published last October found that 63% of global leaders in the UK predicted a full return to in-office working by 2026. Raoul Parekh, a partner at the law firm GQ Littler, said companies including law firms and big banks were increasingly using entry-gate data to track staff attendance. “What we are seeing is monitoring of staff, looking at badge data to track staff, and what [we] would expect now around the corner is the next phase of enforcement and disciplinary action. That has not happened yet,” he said. Last year Lloyds Banking Group offered free food to help win over staff who were asked to come back into the office two days a week. Sharon Doherty, Lloyds’ chief people and places officer, has said the new arrangement provides “an enhanced range of flexible working policies for our people that will help us succeed in driving our ongoing strategic transformation plan”. Paula Tegg, the assistant general secretary of Accord, the union that represents staff at Lloyds, said most staff had returned since last year’s backlash, “albeit in some cases begrudgingly”, and flexibility had been generally granted where individuals had caring responsibilities or health issues.",

        "title": "UK ‘robber baron’ company Melrose gives bosses £176m handout",
        "content": "The UK engineering firm Melrose Industries has handed out a £176m reward pot to 21 of its current and former executives, with the lion’s share going to three of them. In a move that is likely to further fuel the controversy over executive pay, the FTSE 100 company confirmed on Monday that the bosses had been issued with shares totalling £176m under a bonus scheme set up in 2020. The business’s former finance director Geoffrey Martin, and two of its co-founders – ex-CEO Simon Peckham and previous chair Christopher Miller – have received the lion’s share of the 28.8m shares being handed out. As they no longer work for the company, Melrose does not have to disclose how much they are getting, but it is understood it could be up to half of the total – £88m. The trio will have to hold on to shares worth three times their former salaries, roughly about £1.5m each, but can sell the rest at any time. The payout, which follows similar bumper deals for the bosses of UK firms such as AstraZeneca’s Pascal Soriot and David Schwimmer of the London Stock Exchange, is the product of a four-year performance plan under which managers stood to gain 7.5% of any increase to the market value of the company since 2020. During that period, the share price of the group has increased by more than £4bn, with the business currently worth more than £8.1bn. The scheme was set up just a couple of years after the company came in for heavy criticism over a hostile takeover of the British engineering stalwart GKN, which led to Melrose being condemned by the Tory MP Robert Halfon as “robber baron capitalism at its worst”. While the total pot for the payout was around £330m, the company said that just under £160m had been paid to HMRC, with the company in effect cancelling 25m shares to raise the cash. Peter Dilnot, Melrose’s current chief executive, will receive just over £1m in shares but will be unable to sell them while still at the company. The payouts will be the final payday for Miller and Peckham, who alongside David Roper set up Melrose in 2003. After making a series of big industrial acquisitions, its most high-profile deal came in 2018 with the GKN takeover. That prompted Melrose to refocus as a specialist aerospace company, with operations in the US, UK and Sweden. In 2023, it recorded profits of £390m on £3.4bn of revenue. Speaking to the Sunday Times in April, Peckham said the bumper award represented a “good payout”. He said: “You could take a view that no one should earn more than this or that, but I would say that’s capitalism working.”",

        "title": "UK gas prices hit highest level of 2024 after crack closes Norwegian pipeline; UK factories return to growth – as it happened",
        "content": "Time for a quick recap. UK and European gas prices have jumped to their highest level this year following an outage at a gas processing plant in Norway, which has disrupted supplies to the UK. The UK manufacturing sector has returned to growth, with output expanding at the quickest pace in over two years in May on the back of improved intakes of new work. The Labour party has indicated its support for Shein’s potential London listing, as the Chinese online fashion company prepares to push the button on the UK’s biggest ever stock market flotation. Shares in GSK have tumbled 9%, wiping around £6bn off its market value, after a US judge ruled that lawsuits alleging that heartburn treatment Zantac caused cancer could proceed. The US manufacturing sector lost momentum in May, according to the latest healthcheck from the Institute of Supply Management (ISM). The ISM manufacturing PMI, released this afternoon, fell further into contraction territory with a drop to 48.7, from 49.2, mainly due to a fall in new orders. Capital Economics explains: The drop in the ISM manufacturing index in May adds to the sense that the economy is losing momentum, while the drop back in the prices paid index should soothe concerns about a potential renewed rise in goods price pressures. The ISM has not been a particularly good leading indicator of activity over the past 18 months, however, and the decline is at odds with the S&amp;P Global manufacturing PMI, which rallied a little last month. The New York Stock Exchange is investigating a “technical issue” that was leading to large fluctuations in the listed prices of certain stocks. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is caught up in the glitch, with its Class A shares shown falling 99% today. NYSE said the technical issue is related to a mechanism designed to prevent stock prices from swinging wildly. More than 50 stocks on the NYSE, including Berkshire Hathaway and Chipotle Mexican Grill are temporarily halted. Talk of the meme stock craze is back in the financial markets, as certain share prices show remarkable volatility. Shares in GameStop, surged 75% in pre-market trading this morning, after much-followed trader “Roaring Kitty” Keith Gill revealed he had taken a large stake in shares and stock options. A post on Reddit appeared to show that Gill held 5m shares, worth $116m at last Friday’s prices, and a clutch of call options letting him buy more at $20 each. Call options are a bet that a share price will rise – and can also push a share price higher, if the company which wrote the options decides to protect itself by buying the underlying asset, just in case. So far today, GameStop’s shares surged from $23 to $40 when Wall Street opened…. before promptly turning south, and back to $28, up around 25%. Honestly, it’s a daily lesson in Caveat emptor…. Ford managers at sites across the country will begin industrial action later this month in a dispute over pay, unions have warned. Members of Unite at sites including Dunton, Stratford, Dagenham, Daventry and Halewood will begin working to rule and an overtime ban on June 14, with strikes threatened if the dispute is not resolved. The workers have rejected Ford’s pay offer, which Unite said was only a performance related merit award, which they are not guaranteed to receive. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Not content with making billions in profits, Ford has decided to try and attack our members’ pay out of sheer corporate greed. “Performance related payments give no guarantee of an actual pay rise and leave these workers in danger of facing cuts to their wages. “They are absolutely right to take industrial action and they have the full support of Unite in doing so.” Ford said in a statement that it will keep trying to resolve the situation: “We regret that it has resulted in this outcome considering the fair and balanced offer made and the competitiveness of our LL6 pay and benefits package. “We will continue to engage with Unite and our employees and endeavour to resolve the matter.” This page on Gassco’s website confirms that gas flows into the UK’s Easington Gas Terminal, in Yorkshire have dropped to 0MSm3 today. Fortunately, the situation at the Sleipner Riser platform, where the pipeline crack has been discovered, is not considered dangerous according to Gassco. But Alfred Hansen, head of pipeline system operations at Gassco, told Reuters: “This has big consequences from a supply perspective.” Today’s disruption show “the pivotal role” Norway plays in supplying Europe after most Russian pipeline deliveries were halted following the invasion of Ukraine, points out Bloomberg, adding: Even after the energy crisis, the market remains very sensitive to supply issues and prices react quickly when there’s any deviation from the scheduled seasonal maintenance plans. “We as Europeans are dependent on the rest of the world for our energy supply, and that’s a vulnerable situation to be in,” said Jesper Johanson, chief executive officer of Danish trader InCommodities A/S, in an interview. Gassco says it is working on a plan to repair the crack in its pipeline, and on ‘compensationary measures’ to get as much gas to Europe as possible in the meantime: In the energy sector, UK wholesale gas prices have hit their highest level of the year today after a pipeline between Norway and the UK was closed. Norwegian gas pipeline system operator Gassco reported that a crack has been found in a two-inch pipeline onboard Norway’s offshore Sleipner Riser platform. It is not known how long it will take to repair the crack. But the problem has halted gas exports from Norway to Britain through the Langeled pipeline, which runs via Sleipner. Norwegian flows into the UK’s Easington terminal, an entry point for a third of Britain’s total supply, plunged to zero today, Bloomberg reports. This has driven European gas prices to their highest level this year, in a scramble for alternative supplies. The day-ahead price of UK gas has jumped 11.7% to 93.25p per therm, while gas for delivery next month to the UK has jumped 13% to 92.3p. Both contracts are the highest since December 2023. European gas is up 8% at €37.45/MWh, the highest in almost six months. The Labour Party have confirmed they have held talks with Shein ahead of its possible flotation in London, as was reported this morning. A spokesperson for Labour – who remain well ahead in the polls for the July election – explained: “Labour has met a range of companies including Shein that are looking to invest or list in Britain. Raising investment, productivity and growth is one of Labour’s missions for government.” UK factories are doing better than their counterparts in the eurozone. Manufacturing production in the euro area fell again in May, the latest poll of purchasing managers found, with new orders, exports and purchasing activity all softening again. Encouraging, though, production fell at a slower rate than in April, and almost stabilised last month. S&amp;P Global explains: Germany and France – the two largest economies in the single currency union – saw contractions slow, although the former was still the eurozone’s worst-performing manufacturing sector. On the other hand, accelerated expansions were seen in Spain and the Netherlands, both of which registered the best improvements in factory operating conditions since 2022. Greece retained the top rank, despite growth here cooling to a four-month low. More Shein news: it says its resale platform, where customers can resell pre-owned products from the fast fashion retailer, will be made available in Europe and the UK. The platform, which was launched in the U.S. about two years ago, will now be accessible in France, followed by the UK and Germany in subsequent phases, Reuters reports. A resale platform can address one of the criticisms of fast fashion chains like Shein – that clothes are bought cheaply and then ditched for new items. Virgin Atlantic has confirmed it will restart flights between London Heathrow and Tel Aviv on 5 September, almost a year after putting them on hold, PA Media reports. The airline suspended the route in October last year after the start of the war in Gaza. It had originally hoped to restart in March, but decided to push the date back to September. Virgin Atlantic has also signed a codeshare and club sharing deal with Israel’s flag carrier, El Al Israel Airlines, uncer which customers of both airlines will be able to fly on the Tel Aviv-London Heathrow route. Several other airlines, including Wizz Air, easyJet and British Airways, have already begun flying to Tel Aviv again earlier this year. The UK general election hasn’t moved the markets, yet anyway, but it’s a different story elsewhere today. In India, the Nifty 50 share index has hit a record high after exit polls showed Narendra Modi’s BJP party has won the largest election in the country’s history. The Nifty 50 is up over 3% today, and has now almost doubled in value in the last five years. News of Modi’s likely victory also pushed up the rupee against the dollar, and helped India’s sovereign bonds strengthen. But it’s a different story in Mexico, where the currency weakened after official projections showed the ruling party wining power again. The peso has fallen over 2% today, to 17.37 against the US dollar, following forecasts that Claudia Sheinbaum, the protege of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is on track for a major win in elections there. Sheinbaum’s left-wing Morena party could also secure a supermajority in both houses of congress, which will allow it to implement sweeping constitutional reforms. The latest drop in overseas orders at UK factories was due to reduced inflows of new work from several trading partners, including the US, the EU (with specific mentions of Germany and Poland) and the Middle East, S&amp;P Global reports. UK manufacturing could have turned the corner last month, suggests Caroline Litchfield, partner and head of manufacturing and supply chain at independent law firm Brabners: “May could well prove to be a turning point for UK manufacturing after almost two years of weak output. “While we are by no means out of the woods yet, manufacturers will be cautiously optimistic for the future given growth in the wider economy, inflation falling to manageable levels and the potential for interest rates to be cut in the coming weeks. “A confirmed election date is also likely to boost business and consumer confidence, and firms will be hopeful of order books benefiting as a result. “Longer term though, UK makers will want to see any incoming government setting out how it will help address the skills gap within the industry and support a shift to the modern, sustainable methods of manufacturing which will be the pillars of future growth.” Retail analyst Nick Bubb points out that Shein would dwarf the retailers currently listed in London, were it to float here:… Well, it may seem odd that the London stockmarket is courting a big Chinese business, quite apart from the ethical concerns about fast fashion, but if the IPO of Shein does go ahead, its mooted market cap of over £50bn would be bigger than Tesco, Sainsbury, Next, M&amp;S and JD Sports combined… Here’s Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, with analysis of tday’s UK factory PMI report (see 9.43am): “May saw a solid revival of activity in the UK manufacturing sector, with levels of production and new business both rising at the quickest rates since early-2022. The breadth of the recovery was also a positive, with concurrent output and new order growth registered for all of the main subindustries (consumer, intermediate and investment goods) and all company size categories for the first time in over two years. While the latest upturn was dependent on a strengthening domestic market, there were signs of overseas demand also moving closer to stabilisation. Business optimism rose in tandem with the improvement in current conditions, with 63% of manufacturers forecasting their output to be higher one year from now. The latest PMI survey data provided a mixed picture for price pressures at manufacturers, however. At the factory gate, output charge inflation strengthened for the fifth successive month and to its highest level in a year. That said, a solid easing in the rate of increase in input costs should help prevent price pressures from becoming embedded.” Just in: UK factories have returned to growth, with the most rapid expansion in output in over two years. The latest poll of purchasing managers across UK manufacturing found that activity grew across the sector in May. S&amp;P Global Insight, which compiles the PMI report, says: All three product categories covered by the survey (consumer, intermediate and investment goods) and all three size definitions (small, medium and large) registered concurrent expansions for the first time in over two years. In another boost, business optimism rose to a 27-month high. But, while domestic demand was strong, new export orders fell for the twenty-eighth month in a row. This lifted the manufacturing PMI back into positive territory, as it rose to 51.2 in May, up from 49.1 in April, its highest reading since July 2022. Any reading over 50 = growth, and today’s final reading is only slightly below the ‘flash’ number released during May. There are also signs that inflation pressures are building up; output price inflation, which tracks what factories charge for their wares, hit its highest level in a year. The PMI report explains: Rates of [price] increase accelerated in the consumer and intermediate goods sectors, but eased at investment goods producers. A private equity company attempting to take over Hipgnosis has sweetened its offer to value the troubled music rights owner at nearly $1.6bn (£1.26bn) as it attempts to end a protracted sale process. Blackstone has said it that it will switch the offer for the Hipgnosis Songs Fund to a “scheme of arrangement deal”, which would require it to meet a higher threshold of shareholder support but could make the takeover quicker if it is achieved. In a bid to secure the support of more investors of the company, which owns the rights of artists such as Beyoncé, Neil Young, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Justin Bieber, it has increased its offer a share by $0.01 to $1.31, which would value Hipgnosis at about $1.58bn. The revised offer comes after Blackstone fought off competition for Hipgnosis from the US-based royalties fund Concord Music, which had offered $1.4bn. “IPO buzz could be in the air” this morning, reports Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, thanks to Shein’s plan to file a prospectus for a potential London stock market float: The question for UK traders is will this lift the spirits of the FTSE 100, after the index fell 0.77% last week. If this does happen this week, then it would take London a step closer to being Shein’s IPO destination. While this filing does not indicate when its IPO would take place, it could be in the next few months, with Autumn seen as a likely date. The company is expected to be valued at £50bn, which would put it in the top 15 UK listed companies by market cap. Digital bank Monzo has reported its first annual profit this morning, as it continues to target a stock market flotation. Monzo reported a pretax profit of £15.4m for the year to March 2024 in its latest annual accounts, up from a £116.3m loss the previous year. It now has approaching 10 million customers since launching in 2015, and in February secured another £350m in funding from investors, which pushed its value towards £4bn. Shares in UK pharmaceuticals firm GSK have dropped over 9% at the start of trading, after a Delaware judge ruled on Friday that more than 70,000 lawsuits over discontinued heartburn drug Zantac can proceed. Judge Vivian Medinilla of the Delaware Superior Court in Wilmington ruled that expert witnesses can testify in court that the drug may cause cancer – a blow to GSK, and fellow former Zantac manufacturers Pfizer, Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim. The news has knocked GSK’s shares to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. GSK told the City that it disagrees with ruling by the Delaware State Court and will immediately seek an appeal. In a statement, it says: Scientific consensus is that there is no consistent or reliable evidence that ranitidine [or Zantac] increases the risk of any cancer and GSK will continue to vigorously defend itself against all claims Ruling to permit claims is not consistent with the Federal Court’s Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) ruling under the same legal standard Credit rating agency Moody’s has raised China’s growth forecast for 2024 to 4.5% from 4.0%, Reuters reports. Moody’s noted that China’s post-pandemic manufacturing and export-focused growth strategy is taking shape, with trade and manufacturing activity supporting growth in the first quarter of this year. But, 4.5% would still be a slowdown, as China’s GDP rose by 5.2% in 2023. Elsewhere in the business world, Frasers – the company behind Sports Direct – has appointed Sir Jon Thompson, the chair of the HS2 high-speed railway, as a non-executive director. Thompson is an experienced hire – he has previously worked as the former CEO of the Financial Reporting Council, as the CEO of HMRC, and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence. Frasers says hiring Thompson is part of its plan of “elevating its board and its confidence in its long-term growth strategy.” Michael Murray, chief executive officer of Frasers Group (and son-in-law of founder Mike Ashley) told the City this morning: “I am pleased to welcome Sir Jon to the Board at a very exciting time for Frasers Group. His appointment reflects the progress we have made to date on Frasers’ transformation and Elevation Strategy, as well as our ambitions for the future. Sir Jon’s expertise in corporate governance and major project management will be invaluable as we enter the next phase of our strategy.” Frasers has been on a drive to improve its practices, and its image, since the Guardian reported in 2015 that temporary workers at Sports Direct were receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. Ashley – who we learned in 2017 would challenge subordinates to extreme drinking competitions, which once ended with him vomiting into a fireplace – handed over the running of Frasers to Murray in 2022. He still owns over 70% of the company, though. Frasers has also recently appointed the boyfriend of Ashley’s youngest daughter to the company’s board. The Labour Party has held talks with the boss of Shein to try to persuade the Chinese-founded fast-fashion company to opt for a blockbuster London float, The Times reports this morning. They say: Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, Sarah Jones, the shadow minister for industry, and Chris Bryant, the shadow minister for creative industries, are understood recently to have met Donald Tang, the executive chairman of Shein, to discuss a potential initial public offering in London. Sources told The Times that Labour, which could come to power after the general election in July, was “very supportive” of Shein listing in the UK. As Shein was valued at around $66bn in a recent fundraising, it could be London’s biggest ever float…. The Financial Times agrees that landing a flotation of Shein’s size would be “a coup” for the “faltering” UK stock exchange. The FT adds: The company hit a record of more than $2bn in profits for 2023, surpassing the $700mn of net income it generated in 2022 and $1.1bn in 2021. By comparison, rivals H&amp;M and Zara owner Inditex reported net profits of SKr8.7bn ($820mn) and €5.4bn ($5.8bn), respectively, in their most recent fiscal years. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Online fashion giant Shein is heading closer towards floating on the London stock market – a boost for the City, after the company’s efforts to list in New York hit a snag. Shein, which was recently valued at $66bn (£52bn), is planning to file a confidential prospectus with the City regulator this month, according to several reports this morning. This would take it a step closer to a London listing, and let it list more quickly if it decides to take the plunge – perhaps this summer, or in the autumn. Sky News reported last night that the confidential filing could take place as soon as the coming week, although it could yet take place later this month. Shein had initially aimed for a Wall Street float, but those ambitions have been rocked by political opposition as tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated. Shein, which launched as SheInside in 2011 in Nanjing, China, has taken the fashion world by storm, offering a very wide range of very affordable clothing. As my colleague Nicole Lipman explained in April: On today’s “New In” page, there are 8,640 items (yesterday there were 8,760). The most expensive dress of the nearly 9,000 new arrivals – a floor-length, long-sleeved, fully sequinned plus-size gown, available in five sparkly colours – is $67. The cheapest – a short, tight piece of polyester with spaghetti straps, a cowl neckline and an all-over print of Renaissance-style flowers and cherubs – is $7. I can buy casual dresses, going-out tops, workout leggings, winter parkas, pink terry-cloth hooded rompers, purple double-breasted suit jackets with matching trousers, red pleather straight-leg pants, cropped cardigans with mushroom embroidery, black sheer lace thongs and rhinestone-trimmed hijabs. I can buy a wedding dress for $37. I can buy clothes for school, work, basketball games, proms, funerals, nightclubs, sex clubs. I see patchwork-printed overalls and black bikinis with rhinestones in the shape of a skull over each nipple designated as “punk”. I can buy Christian-girl modesty clothing and borderline fetish wear. In the grid of product listings, a yellow rectangle indicates if a product is trending: “Trending-Plazacore”, “Trending-Western”, “Trending-Mermaidcore”, and “Trending-Y2K” tags all appear in the new arrivals…. But, Shein’s high-octane ‘test and repeat’ model – in which it churns out thousands of new products a day – is also controversial, and seen the company dubbed “the unacceptable face of throwaway fast fashion”. Shein has also been accused of using forced labour to produce its low-cost garments. In 2022, Bloomberg discovered that garments shipped to the US by Shein were made with cotton from the Xinjiang region, where China is accused of “serious human rights violations” against the Uyghur Muslim people. But that probably won’t deter the City from embracing Shein, given the well-documented concerns that the London market is in crisis as some firms shift their listings across the Atlantic. Also coming up today It’s a busy day for economic news, with new surveys of factory bosses across the world giving a healthcheck on global manufacturing. Traders are digesting yesterday’s Opec+ meeting, where oil producers agreed to extend their production cuts into 2025. Tensions are rising in South Wales, where union leaders are preparing to ramp up industrial action at two steelworks, in a further escalation of a row over almost 3,000 job losses that threatens to become a big general election issue. And in France, the government has been stung by a credit rating downgrade by S&amp;P Global on Friday night, from AA to AA- with a stable outlook. S&amp;P Global cited France’s rising debts and lower-than-expected growth – a blow to Emmanuel Macron’s stewardship of the economy… The agenda 7am BST: Russia’s manufacturing PMI for May 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for May 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for May 3pm BST: US manufacturing PMI for May",

        "title": "Ex-BA boss: drop green aviation policies if costs outweigh benefits",
        "content": "Green aviation policies should be abandoned if the costs outweigh the benefits, the head of the world’s most influential airlines body has said. Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata) and a former British Airways boss, said achieving net zero by 2050 was “existential, not optional”. However, he also suggested governments should have the courage to stop green policies and change tack if they were not producing the intended results. The comments came as part of Walsh’s keynote speech at Iata’s annual general meeting in Dubai on Monday, in which the body revealed that the global aviation sector would achieve a net profit of more than $30bn (£24bn) this year, up by $3bn on last year’s figure. Part of Walsh’s speech focused on current approaches to decarbonise the aviation sector and tackle the climate crisis, in which he hit out against green levies on the sector. He said more taxes were not the solution to achieving net zero and that the current “parade of fragmented green tax proposals” were prohibiting people from flying sustainably and grounding all but the rich. Walsh put forward eight approaches that he argued would improve the world’s progress towards greener aviation, which included a call for provisions to be put in place that would allow certain green policies to be reviewed and scrapped if they did not work. “Measures must have provisions for review and abandonment if they are not producing the intended results,” he said. “Some good ideas will certainly translate into good policies. And many may not. “When a policy has clearly failed – especially when costs outweigh benefits – regulators must have the courage to stop, and change tack fast.” Walsh said the global industry needed global solutions and Iata would be pushing for globally recognised and accepted rules to reduce carbon emissions, while also calling for measures be put in place to direct more fossil fuel investment into sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). A number of countries are bringing in SAF mandates, which put requirements on providers to use a certain percentage of the fuel in their aircraft. SAFs can be sourced from food-waste oil and fats, green and municipal waste and non-food crops, and it is claimed they could cut emissions by 80% compared with traditional fuels. However, critics say hopes for the technology are overblown, with a report by the Institute for Policy Studies thinktank arguing efforts to bring SAFs up to scale are too far off track to avert the climate crisis. The UK is poised to pass its own SAF mandate in January next year, which will put in place laws that require 2% of all jet fuel used by airlines to come from sustainable and low-carbon sources by the end of 2025, and 10% by 2030. SAF now equates to just more than 0.5% of the globe’s fuel needs. Walsh said these mandates faced a number of problems, with governments sometimes mandating airlines to buy SAF in quantities that did not exist. He said this often resulted in producers being hit with fines and passing them on to airlines. “We witnessed this in France where fuel suppliers are happy to accept penalties for their failure to supply the SAF mandate. They simply exercise their monopoly power and pass those costs on [to] airlines. This must be stopped,” he said. Iata revealed that airlines would probably reach profits of $30.5bn in 2024, up from the $27.4bn that are estimated for 2023. This was also up on the $25.7bn forecast for 2024 in December this year. It also forecast record revenues of $1tn for the sector but this would be partly offset by record expenses of $946bn.",

        "title": "Shein wins Labour support as it prepares £50bn London listing",
        "content": "The Labour party has indicated its support for Shein’s potential London listing, as the Chinese online fashion company prepares to push the button on the UK’s biggest ever stock market flotation. The £52bn retailer is reportedly close to confidentially filing a prospectus for the listing on the London Stock Exchange to the Financial Conduct Authority as early as this week. Labour confirmed a report that its MPs had met the retailer, among “a range of companies including Shein that are looking to invest or list in Britain”. A spokesperson for the party said: “Raising investment, productivity and growth is one of Labour’s missions for government.” However, the listing could prove politically divisive. Shein’s decision to opt for London comes after an initial effort to float in New York was derailed when politicians and regulators raised concerns about tensions between Beijing and Washington. Senior politicians, including three parliamentary committee chairs, have questioned efforts to woo Shein, raising concerns about labour conditions in its supply chains. Labour said it expected “the highest regulatory standards and business practices” from businesses operating in the UK. “We believe the best way to ensure this is to have more companies operating from and regulated by UK law,” the spokesperson said. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, Sarah Jones, the shadow minister for industry, and Chris Bryant, the shadow minister for creative industries, recently met Donald Tang, Shein’s executive chair to discuss listing, the Times reported. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, also met Tang earlier this year to try to persuade Shein to list in the UK rather than New York. The company, which was launched in Nanjing, China, in 2012, has rapidly become one of the world’s largest fashion retailers because of its low prices and high-volume sales. It is headquartered in Singapore and, while most of its suppliers are based in China, it does not sell products to the country. The company posted more than $2bn of profits in 2023, nearly double the $1.1bn in 2021. If listed in the UK it is understood it could be valued at £50bn. The expected filing of a prospectus does not guarantee the company will list in the UK but people close to the process told Sky News – which first reported the impending filing – it represented a significant moment that meant a City float for Shein was very likely. Shein has previously responded to criticism by saying it took visibility across its supply chain seriously, had zero tolerance to forced labour and was committed to human rights. If Shein does list in the UK it would be a significant boost in what has been a gloomy period for the LSE, with a number of high-profile companies leaving the UK for listings elsewhere. Last month, the Paddy Power owner Flutter confirmed it was moving its listing from London to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to persuade it to float in the UK. Earlier this year, the Anglo-German travel company Tui voted to abandon the LSE in favour of listing its shares solely in Germany. However, there was some good news last month, when the UK-based tech firm Raspberry Pi confirmed its intention to float in the UK. The listing would eclipse the biggest listing seen on the LSE – the commodities company Glencore’s £38bn float in 2011 – and the spin-out of GSK’s consumer goods arm as Haleon, at £30.5bn in 2022. Separately on Monday, Shein said its resale platform, where customers can resell pre-owned products from the fast-fashion retailer, would be made available in Europe and the UK. The platform, which was launched in the US about two years ago, will be accessible in France, followed by the UK and Germany in subsequent phases, Reuters reported. The European launch may help address one of the key criticisms of fast-fashion retailers such as Shein – that its clothes are bought cheaply and then thrown away in favour of new items.",

        "title": "Private equity group to improve offer for Beyoncé song fund Hipgnosis",
        "content": "A private equity company attempting to take over Hipgnosis has sweetened its offer to value the troubled music rights owner at nearly $1.6bn (£1.26bn) as it attempts to end a protracted sale process. Blackstone has said it will switch the offer for the Hipgnosis Songs Fund to a “scheme of arrangement deal”, which would require it to meet a higher threshold of shareholder support but could make the takeover quicker if it is achieved. In an attempt to secure the support of more investors of the company, which owns the rights of artists including Beyoncé, Neil Young, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Justin Bieber, it has increased its offer a share by $0.01 to $1.31, which would value Hipgnosis at about $1.58bn. The revised offer comes after Blackstone fought off competition for Hipgnosis from the US-based royalties fund Concord Music, which had offered $1.4bn. If the deal is completed, it would mark the end of a turbulent six years for Hipgnosis, which was set up in 2018 by Merck Mercuriadis, the former manager of acts including Elton John, Iron Maiden, Guns N’ Roses and Beyoncé. Mercuriadis used his music industry connections to spend millions on the rights to 138 catalogues with more than 40,000 songs but the company ran into problems recently because of rising interest rates and changes to the valuation of its songs. This resulted in a shareholder rebellion last year, with its investors voting in October against continuing the struggling fund in its then form. Under the scheme of arrangement deal put forward by Blackstone on Monday, the takeover will need approval from 75% of voting shareholders. The previous arrangement required 55% of all investors to back the deal. However, once this is met the deal becomes binding across all investors and would make it easier for Blackstone to control all of the shares in issue, regardless of whether a shareholder voted for it or not. Blackstone is already a majority shareholder in Hipgnosis’s investment adviser, Hipgnosis Songs Management, which is paid to manage the music rights fund. This deal will be separate to this but Blackstone did have an option to make an offer for the Hipgnosis portfolio if the advisory agreement was terminated.",

        "content": "Qantas is rolling out a new boarding regime that will see passengers split into six boarding groups as it seeks to fill its planes faster and to ensure they depart on time. The new boarding protocol will initially apply only to domestic flights on Airbus A330s and Boeing 737s – the workhorses of its domestic services between capital cities. The new system was put in place at Brisbane airport from Monday, and its introduction will be staggered throughout the month, coming into effect at Perth airport from 10 June, at Melbourne from 17 June and Sydney from 25 June. Qantas will now split passengers into six groups in an attempt to avoid the chaotic queues that form at gates when economy is called to board. Premium travellers and the most loyal customers will retain superior priority. Group one will include those in business class, frequent flyers with platinum or platinum one status, as well as travellers from the exclusive chairman’s lounge. Gold frequent flyers will board as group two. However, instead of the traditional approach where the front and back half of the plane are called to board separately, the cabin will be split into quarters. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Group three will include everyone seated in the back quarter of the plane, progressing to group six, which consists of passengers in the front quarter of economy. Each passenger’s group will be printed on their boarding pass, with scanners at the gate only permitting customers of a group already called to pass through. The new system is intended to speed up boarding and minimise congestion throughout the cabin as travellers in back rows are forced to wait while those in earlier rows stand to load luggage into overhead lockers or shuffle between seats. The Qantas domestic chief executive, Markus Svensson, said the change was the most significant change to boarding in a decade. “Group Boarding is designed to minimise the time our customers spend waiting to board and allows them to get settled more quickly,” Svensson said. “We know how important on time departure is to our customers, so this process is also about doing everything possible to ensure we depart on time.” Qantas noted similar boarding methods had already been implemented by rivals overseas. The airline’s approach is in contrast to US carrier United Airlines, which last year announced it would board economy passengers by their seat, not just their row, as part of its multi group boarding stages. On United flights, window seat passengers board first, followed by those with middle seats, before aisle seat travellers board. The system is designed to minimise traffic in the cabin aisles by avoiding the need for already seated passengers to get up to allow a window seat passenger in. United believes its approach cuts its boarding times by two minutes a flight.",

        "title": "European and Canadian central banks expected to cut interest rates this week",
        "content": "Borrowers in the eurozone and in Canada are expected to get some relief from high interest rates this week. After recent drops in inflation, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BoC) are forecast to lower their benchmark rates in the coming days. The ECB will set its policy on Thursday, with the money markets indicating rate cuts are a 93% chance. It is likely to lower the rate on its deposit facility, which banks can use to make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem, to 3.75%, down from its current record high of 4%. A poll of 82 economists by Reuters last week found they all expected a rate cut at the 6 June meeting, after several ECB policymakers hinted it was a done deal. There’s an 82% chance that the BoC will cut borrowing costs on Wednesday, from 5% to 4.75%, market pricing indicates. These odds rose on Friday after Canada’s GDP grew more slowly than forecast in the first three months of this year. This would put the ECB and BoC among the first of the big central banks to ease policy in the current cycle, following the Swiss National Bank, which cut its rates in March. But the future path of interest rates remains unclear, given signs that inflation could be more persistent than hoped. Konstantin Veit, a fund manager at Pimco, said: “We believe the ECB will cut policy rates by 25 basis points at the June meeting to 3.75% on the deposit facility. “However, what will be more interesting is the trajectory beyond June. We doubt the ECB will provide a lot of guidance here, and expect it to re-emphasise its meeting by meeting approach based on the data flow over the coming months. We think it unlikely that the ECB will commit to any particular rate path.” Data released on Friday showed that eurozone inflation rose in May, for the first month this year, to 2.6%. That took it further away from the ECB’s forecast of 2%, but was still much lower than the year before when euro-area inflation was 6.1%. Analysts at Nomura believe this could make the ECB cautious about pursuing an aggressive cutting cycle, but still expect several interest rate reductions in the next 18 months. “For the ECB, we see three 25 basis point rate cuts this year and three next, taking the depo rate down to 2.50%,” Nomura said in a research note. Canada’s annual inflation rate cooled to 2.7% in April, down from 2.9% in March, potentially clearing the way for the BoC to ease policy this week. Goldman Sachs analysts said “disinflation is well under way in Canada”, telling clients: “We therefore expect that the BoC will determine that downward inflation momentum has been sustained and cut its policy rate by 25bp to 4.75% at [the] June meeting.” Although UK inflation fell to just 2.3% in April, the Bank of England is not expected to cut interest rates at its meeting later this month. The first cut is not expected until November or December.",

        "content": "The Opec+ group of oil producers have agreed to extend most of their production curbs into next year, in an attempt to shore up crude prices. After a ministerial meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, the Opec cartel and allies including Russia decided to extend a cut of 2m barrels a day until the end of 2025, rather than ending it at the end of 2024. In a statement, Opec said the group had agreed to “extend the level of overall crude oil production for Opec and non-Opec participating countries … starting 1 January 2025 until 31 December 2025.” A group of Opec+ members agreed to extend other, voluntary cuts, which were also meant to support oil prices amid subdued global demand. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman gathered on the sidelines of the Riyadh meeting, and pledged to extend their additional voluntary cuts of 1.65m barrels a day until the end of December 2025. A second group of additional voluntary cuts totalling 2.2m barrels per day (bpd), announced in November 2023, will now be extended until the end of September 2024 – and then phased out over the next year. The cuts aim to “support the stability and balance of oil markets”, said Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Energy in a statement. Opec also agreed a new output target for the UAE – it will be allowed to gradually raise production by 300,000 bpd, up from the current level of 2.9m bpd. The Brent crude oil price weakened last month, falling from almost $88 (£69) a barrel at the end of April to $81.62 at the end of May. The meeting in Riyadh came as Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer within Opec, began the sale of 1.545m shares in the mostly state-owned producer Aramco, or about 0.64% of shares in issue, which could raise $12bn. This secondary share sale comes five years after Aramco was floated on the public markets, in the world’s largest initial public offering ever. It runs until Thursday, and saw strong interest from investors on Sunday when demand already exceeded the amount of shares on offer. Bill Blain, the market strategist at Wind Shift Capital, said Saudi Arabia was using the wealth of its oil reserves to innovate and diversify its economy. “Although some of the projects at the core of the reinvention of Saudi have already been scaled back due to escalating costs, and its purchase of global sports franchises is generally misunderstood, the plan is to fuel the economy with plentiful investment by the state SWF, the Public Investment Fund,” he added.",

        "title": "Union plans to escalate action over job losses at two steelworks in Wales",
        "content": "Union leaders are preparing to ramp up industrial action at two south Wales steelworks, in a further escalation of a row over almost 3,000 job losses that threatens to become a big general election issue. Unite said such moves at the Port Talbot and Llanwern works are planned after the sites’ Indian owner, Tata Steel, threatened to cut redundancy pay as a response to members voting for an overtime ban. The actions come after Tata rejected a trade union plan this year designed to keep Port Talbot’s blast furnaces running, with their closure putting 2,800 jobs at risk and leaving the UK on course to become the only major economy unable to make steel from scratch. Tata told workers’ representatives in January that it could no longer afford to continue production at the loss-making Port Talbot plant while it completed a four-year transition plan towards greener production. The company said operating the old furnaces was losing it £1m a day. The row now threatens to spill over into a general election issue – with what appears to be three competing proposals from the Conservatives, the unions and Labour. Tata and the Conservative government agreed a deal last year whereby the company would receive £500m in state subsidies to help with the move to new “greener” furnaces – which could cut UK emissions by about 2% if renewable electricity was used. However, the deal also involved starting to close blast furnaces from this month, triggering the job losses. At the time, the business and trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, said: “This proposal will secure a sustainable future for Welsh steel and is expected to save thousands of jobs in the long term.” Keir Starmer has signalled that a Labour government would reverse the agreement, stating on a visit to Wales last week: “I will fight for every single job and fight for the future of steel in Wales.” The shadow Welsh secretary, Jo Stevens, said on Sunday: “We have repeatedly said no irreversible decisions should be made before polling day. Labour’s plans for a steel fund will ensure the future of the industry is fuelled by the skills, talent and ambition of Welsh steelworkers. “We don’t want to see a single job go at the site but Conservative ministers failed to take steps to protect workers and communities before a general election was called.” Labour has said it would invest £3bn in the transition to green steel. However, weekend reports suggested that the party would not support an alternative union plan, which proposes keeping a blast furnace in operation while building an electric arc furnace, saving jobs. The general secretary of Unite, Sharon Graham, said: “Unite and its members will not tolerate Tata’s bullyboy tactics and neither should Labour. The union is now preparing to escalate industrial action in direct response to the company’s threats. “The company is trying to hold the country to ransom, while needlessly throwing thousands of workers on the scrapheap. If Tata is not prepared to do the right thing, then an incoming Labour government must ensure it does.” A Tata Steel spokesperson said the redundancy terms on offer were “generous” and that the company was “now considering our legal options regarding the legality of their ballot”. He added: “The enhanced package will remain in place unless industrial action is taken, in which case it would revert to our standard terms. “In light of the ongoing impact on the business, the potential for further disruption, and in order to ensure safe and stable operations, we are now considering bringing forward the dates for the closure of blast furnace 5 and the winding down of operations across the wider heavy-end.” Under the current plan, about 1,900 jobs are expected to be lost at Port Talbot. A further 600 jobs are at risk across the rest of the UK and then 300 are expected to go in the next three years. A Conservative party spokesperson said: “The Conservative government put in place one of the biggest support packages in UK history, investing half a billion pounds in new, modern electric arc furnaces to secure the future of the steelworks in south Wales. “The Labour party, despite running the Welsh government, have done nothing to help in this process. Any reversal of this ground-breaking deal would inevitably mean thousands of steel jobs were lost, or tens of billions would need to be spent – leading to higher taxes. “Keir Starmer makes these empty promises because he doesn’t have a plan. While the Conservatives are delivering a regeneration of the area around Port Talbot and a transition board, backed by £80m, to ensure steelworkers are properly supported throughout this process, Labour would take us back to square one, with fewer jobs and higher taxes.”",

        "title": "Immigration must be matched with investment in UK infrastructure to ease pressures | Larry Elliott",
        "content": "Imagine that during the election campaign Rishi Sunak announced that by 2038 he expected migration to boost the population by 3.7m – more than the current number of people living in Wales. What would your response be? It’s a question worth asking, because such an increase is precisely what has been seen since David Cameron pledged in 2010 to reduce net immigration to the tens of thousands annually. In the current parliament alone, net migration to the UK has been 2m. One response might be that from days of yore Britain’s history has been shaped and enriched by migrants, so it makes sense to continue with a liberal response. Another would be that the economy relies heavily on workers from overseas and that without them the NHS and social care would collapse. Universities that rely on foreign students because they pay higher fees than their UK-born counterparts are facing a financial crisis. But it’s reasonable to assume that many people would want to know whether there was a plan for coping with an increase in the population equivalent to the size of Edinburgh, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Stoke, Bristol and Cardiff combined in such a relatively short period. They might ask what the impact would be on the availability of housing, on rents in our big cities, and on school places. They would want to know what it would mean for NHS waiting lists and whether the arrival of foreign-born workers would drive down wages. These would be legitimate questions to ask, and they are being asked not only in the UK but across the developed west: in other European countries, and in North America and Oceania alike. Nor is Britain exceptional in the size of its foreign-born population. Indeed, it is very much middle of the pack for high-income countries. That said, large net inward migration flows are relatively recent for the UK. In almost every year between the end of the second world war and the early 1980s more people emigrated than migrated inward. It has only been in the past 25 years that net migration has picked up and become so important to the economy. Initially, most of the newly arrived workers came from elsewhere in Europe, with a marked increase after the accession of the former Soviet bloc countries of eastern Europe in 2004 and another rise around the time of the eurozone crisis in the first half of the 2010s, plus another big jump post-pandemic. Since Brexit, however, the pattern has changed. The number of EU workers has fallen but has been more than offset by arrivals from the rest of the world. There have been benefits from net migration. Well-educated and skilled workers from eastern Europe enhanced the UK’s stock of human capital. They helped to boost growth and plugged gaps in the jobs market. Ashley Webb, a UK economist at Capital Economics, says net migration from non-EU countries has been entirely responsible for the rise in labour supply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and that future net migration will ease labour shortages and put downward pressure on inflation. “Between the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2024, the labour force increased by just 200,000. Within that, the number of non-EU born people willing and available to work rose by about 1.5 million, while the number of people born in the EU and the UK fell by about 200,000 and 1.0 million respectively. Moreover, for the first time since the data series began in 1997, the inactivity rate for non-EU born people is now below the inactivity rate for UK-born people,” Webb says. Webb is right to point out that net migration solves some short-term problems. Whether it is so good for the UK in the long term is another matter. For a start, what matters is not the size of the economy measured by gross domestic product but the size of the economy divided by the number of people. Per capita gross domestic product fell by 1.2% between the end of 2019 and start of 2024. Net migration has done nothing to arrest the downward trend in per capita GDP since 2010: indeed, the availability of cheap labour may well have discouraged companies from investing in the new capital that would help boost productivity and growth in incomes. Then there’s housing – or rather the lack of it. Housing supply has not remotely kept up with demand in recent years, leading to higher property prices and more expensive rents. A rising population is one reason why so many young people rely on the bank of mum and dad to buy their first home or end up living with their parents in their late 20s and early 30s. These pressures will persist even if the Office for National Statistics’s assumption that net migration will settle down to an average of 315,000 in the coming years proves accurate. But that’s not to say that breaking out of Britain’s high migration-low productivity trap is going to be easy, either. That requires more than just a cap on the number of people allowed into Britain each year, with a focus on attracting the most talented. It will also require recruiting far more UK-born doctors, nurses, and care workers – and paying them suitably attractive salaries. During the election the focus is likely to be on how to stop small boats crossing the Channel, even though legal migration far exceeds illegal migration. But the reality is that high migration is being used to paper over the cracks caused by austerity and to perpetuate what would – in sectors such as hospitality and higher education – otherwise be unviable business models. Large-scale migration without the equivalent large-scale investment in the infrastructure to cope with the pressures it causes is an accident waiting to happen.",

This week, those roles look set to be reversed, with M&amp;S riding high and Ocado now expected to drop out of the index of the UK’s top companies in the quarterly reshuffle, after its valuation plunged to about £3bn from a high of £22bn during the pandemic.

The pair are wrangling over a final payment for their UK-based grocery delivery tie-up, Ocado Retail, which was hoped to be worth more than £190m. M&amp;S says it should pay nothing because performance has been so poor. Ocado’s feisty boss, Tim Steiner, has threatened legal action in response. The final call on Ocado’s FTSE position will be made using market data on 4 June, but based on Friday’s figures its share price would have to take a last-minute leap to avoid relegation. That seems unlikely amid uncertain sentiment that has led to a drop of about 50% so far this year, to 373p. Ocado is described by Dan Coatsworth at stockbroker AJ Bell as “one of the most Marmite names on the UK stock market”. When high streets were shut down as way to control Covid, Ocado enjoyed a boost from the shift to home deliveries – and convinced many that the change would be permanent. In the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, it emerged that people had quite missed visiting a shop for their groceries, with the UK’s online orders shifting back to about 11% of the market, from a peak of 14% in 2021. Specialists in ultra-fast grocery delivery which enjoyed a private-equity-backed boom during lockdown, such as Getir and Gorillas, have rapidly folded in the UK, leaving the field largely to takeaway meal specialists such as Deliveroo and Just Eat – none of which appear to be making much profit. The trajectory of such groups does not fuel confidence in the future for Ocado’s own fast-track service, Zoom, one of its hoped-for growth areas. Ocado made a pre-tax loss of £394m for the year to 3 December 2023; the previous year’s loss had been £500m. In April, a fifth of shareholders lodged a protest vote against the group’s plans for a £14.8m pay package for Steiner. Meanwhile, Ocado’s focus on robot-led warehouse technology has proved to be rather inflexible, such that the company was unable to fully capitalise on booming demand during the pandemic, or row back later without major financial pain. Big supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose have shut down at least some of their home-delivery warehouses, focusing instead on more cost-effective and flexible deliveries from stores. On the plus side, this year Ocado’s retail venture with M&amp;S has stepped up sales growth. However, M&amp;S boss Stuart Machin has recently pointed out that Ocado’s much-trumpeted Smart Platform technology upgrades – such as new software and robot picking arms to make deliveries more efficient – had been “much delayed”, possibly further cooling hopes for the group’s efforts to sell its technology around the world. During the pandemic, Ocado’s share price also took off as investors saw it as the UK’s answer to Silicon Valley technology firms rather than simply an online grocer. It has undoubtedly won some major customers for its gadgetry, including Kroger in the US, Groupe Casino in France, Lotte in South Korea and Aeon in Japan, but investors had hoped for more. Critics, such as Shore Capital’s Clive Black, note the millions spent on research and development in return for quite modest sales, while delays to key projects, such as a delivery centre for Coles in Australia, have hit confidence. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “Deals are not being signed as fast as investors were hoping for its future growth engine, Solutions. It charges third-party retailers to use Ocado’s robotic systems. There’s still big potential here, but timeframes of growth look more questionable and that’s knocked the valuation.” Ocado’s expected exit from the FTSE 100 has only fuelled speculation that Ocado will look to list in the US instead of the UK. Steiner may encounter fewer complaints about multimillion-pound pay deals across the Atlantic but whether that will help find new fans of the group’s robots remains in doubt.",

        "title": "Heart of the batter: my lifelong love affair with fish and chips",
        "content": "They were there, outside the fish and chip shop, all of them. The dad with his household order on a scrappy sliver of paper. The girl of 11 or 12 quietly reciting her own family’s demands, lips miming through lyrics of Mum’s mushy peas and little brother’s Vimto. Teenagers documenting the seconds that passed on mobile phones. They argued over whether gravy on chips was disgusting or not without looking up from their screens. A man of 60 or so joined us, rubbed his hands together and addressed my mum: “You can’t beat Chippy Night can you, love?” For a few splendid minutes, the democracy of the chip-shop queue made everything seem all right. Mum agreed with the man. It was she who declared this was our Chippy Night, an electric phrase that still, in my early 40s, elicits a cry of “Get in!” and a cheer from my teenage daughter. All three of us were there now, outside the Fisherman’s Wife in York, our nostrils tickled by the smell of batter and vinegar, our eyes drawn to the cosy glow of a fish and chip shop on a dark night. Among the closed shops and curtained windows of Bishopthorpe Road, it gleamed like a gold tooth in a barren mouth. In order to read the blackboard menu inside, Mum was on her tip-toes now, peeking over a veil of window condensation. I looked at her and realised that I had grown up with this comforting ritual for most of my life. Later, as we emerged from the doorway, my daughter asked if she could carry our bundles of fish and chips home, warming herself on them as she had done since she could walk. Next came the familiar request: “Can I try a chip now, just to check them?” This most spartan, unfussy and unchanged of meals, and the habit of lining up outside its neon houses, had become a golden-battered thread between all three of us. At times, even the ghost of my grandad comes along, materialising briefly in the stories Mum would repeat about him. “He’d always go in and ask if they left the skin on their fish,” she’d recall. “Then call them ‘Dirty bastards’ if they did.” We are not alone in this continuity. It is what fish and chips do. Every person in that queue probably had their own stories, memories, habits and connections. If they didn’t, then they were making them now. At different times as we waited, all of us peered through the condensation at what was happening inside. It transported me backwards, hurtling through time, to an age younger than my daughter is now. There I was, 12 years old, with my friend Richard beside me, both of us watching what looked like bleary ghosts bobbing around inside the chip shop. Queueing up after our visits to the swimming baths, a seductive aroma would drift out from the shop each time the door opened, a movement which also set free the melodic refrain of a chip lifter tinkling against the frying range. Once inside, we’d see that our bobbing ghosts were the white-coated women who worked behind the counter. Then, we’d await the heavenly call of “Who’s next, please?”, a sound even sweeter than a fire alarm during double chemistry. Perhaps the fact that I find such comfort and calm in fish and chip shops was inevitable – and even biological. Their very existence is tethered to mine. Just over a century ago my great-grandma, working in the family chippy in Wetherby, and my great-grandad, queueing for his tea, locked eyes for the first time. Courting followed and then came marriage, I hope with scraps thrown as confetti. Running chip shops – or “fish shops” as they, West Yorkshire folk, would call them – became something of a family trade. For not much outlay, owning one offered a ladder to relative riches for people who usually hacked coal for a living. Sitting in her chair, a myna bird in the cage beside her, my great-grandma would later tell of her days at the frying range, powered by coal and then newspaper when that ran out. In her 90s by the 1990s, she talked about chip-shop prices between the wars and how their business sold nothing but the basics – mushy peas came later, a flashy extravagance. This was Yorkshire, after all. Eventually, family shops were sold and ours became a story from the other side of the range – that of Chippy Night and childhood enchantment. We are eaters, not makers. Through separate stages of life flow different chip-shop traditions. When we three queue now, we are blissfully partaking in the latest rituals. Who knows, one day I may queue with my own grandchildren and bamboozle them with the very concept of drinking dandelion and burdock. Chip shops grant that sense of the unchanging and the concrete – of the being sure of something – that is central to feeling anchored. Each one is also pleasingly different to the next, a deep-fried republic, something revitalising in a country of unvarying high streets. This much is symbolised in the regional variations offered across the land: Wolverhampton’s orange chips, Hull’s chip spice, Cumbrian patties. They are tiny, shimmering and gurgling societies of their own, focal to the communities that surround them. They are also an endangered species. Our chippies have faced desperate times before, but none so difficult as these. In 2022, such was the saddening and alarming rate at which they were closing, the National Federation of Fish Friers warned of “potentially an extinction event”. Sarson’s, the vinegar manufacturer, predicted that half the UK’s 10,500 chip shops would be gone by 2025. This has always been a backbreaking trade of long hours, but in recent times external, uncontrollable factors have worsened the load. Last year, a combination of post-Brexit supply-chain difficulties, a shortage of cheap raw materials resulting from the war in Ukraine and severe energy cost rises made running a chip shop an arduous undertaking. More recently, the UK’s relentlessly wet autumn and winter greatly damaged the potato crop, meaning what has survived will cost owners more. Oil prices continue to rise, too. For customers, the central repercussion is a stark increase in the price of this traditionally affordable treat. Even takeaway fish and chips has, in many places, climbed above the psychologically sacrosanct £10 barrier. Perhaps we need to stop thinking of this as a cheap and cheerful meal. All the same, a tenner for something so gladdening, tasty and filling does represent good value. Especially, that is, if you do as my family has always done and reheat leftover chips for butties the next day. There may be some who see this demise as an inevitable, irreversible trend and even a consequence of market forces. As a nation, our tastes have broadened and there have never been so many alternative genres of cuisine. Yet this dish still matters, too, offering something shared, something so many of us love now or associate with fond memories. Fish and chips have the soft power to bind many of us together, even if it is just for a two-minute conversation about vinegar or pickled onions as we queue. With the same adherence to simple, quality ingredients, and with their usual resilience, fish and chip shops can and will survive. The burden is more on us, as customers, to join the queue and stumble upon new traditions. Back when I was 12, my friend and I would emerge from the ghosts’ chippy with paper bales of the good stuff. Chip heat reanimated our cold and chlorine-crimped fingers. Batter flew smoke signals into the dank evening, steam-drying our uncombed and sodden hair. We ambled cautiously onwards, scoffing ravenously, but guarding our packages. Eating outside extinguished etiquette. Under the sky, we could talk with our mouths full and pincer our food with eager fingers. Wooden forks were plunged into a plump chip and left dormant, tiny Excalibur swords welded into Maris Pipers. Further traditions followed. There was the chip shop on Essex Street, Middlesbrough, that Dad and I would visit after watching our beloved Middlesbrough FC lose again. It offered the hot glee of chips from what appeared to be the front room of a terrace house. Then, when my parents split, Mum introduced Tuesday Treat Night to cheer that dreary day – few dishes, or indeed pursuits, equalled the battered comfort of a chippy visit. In young adulthood, there was time spent with my grandma in the Wetherby Whaler, a few metres from where my great-grandma met her love, and home to smooth batter and chips with a week’s worth of flavour. After I left York for Newcastle University, those familiar vinegar scents and flashing signs in my new city made it feel less far from home. Then, some years later, a minor parental miracle of the type that doesn’t matter yet matters enormously happened. The toddler who called me “Daddy” loved the golden food she shared with me one afternoon while sitting on my knee in a Whitby fish and chip restaurant. Soon, we found a place to go, a local. Sitting opposite one another, her young conversation percolating, ordering from the small menu and the big one became a weekly occasion – usually after swimming, of course. Fish and chips had become our thing. Travelling across the country to research my book, in Dundee and Devon, in Bethnal Green and Blackpool and in many places besides, I learned that these were not my feelings and experiences alone. Everywhere families and friends, people falling in love and people who just wanted to get out for a bit, were revelling in their visits to chip shops and restaurants. They had their own rituals, from the outlets they visited to the way they dressed and doused their meals, and their own routines. Somehow these places, and fish and chips, belonged to them. In a health-conscious world this may seem alien, and even reprehensible. Arteries were probably harmed in the making of my book. Yet the mental health benefits of a moderate chip-shop habit are serious and many. Here is something calming and connecting, something shared and constant. Something ever-present upon a planet shuddering in chaos and flux. Whenever we see those two words separated by an ampersand lit up on some damp night, we chippy types are home, wherever we may be.

        "title": "Europe must splash the cash (and seize it) to save 2024",
        "content": "There were hopes that 2024 would be a good year. Economists talked of a soft landing, by which they meant a solid rebound from last year’s high-inflation, high-interest shock. A drop in inflation would spark cuts to the cost of borrowing while trade expanded, unemployment stayed low, and household disposable incomes increased. This cheerful scenario was going to be played out across Europe and allow the EU and UK to pursue many of the goals, not least tackling climate change, that were delayed as ministers sought to protect business and household finances from the fallout from the pandemic and the Ukraine war. Consumers were going to recover some confidence and businesses would shrug off a decade of confusion brought on by Brexit, the US-China trade dispute, and a global public spending drought that had stymied private investment (because private investors like to piggyback on taxpayer-funded schemes). The European Central Bank (ECB) was expected until recently to acknowledge an improving domestic and global outlook with a first cut in the cost of borrowing. Unlike the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve, which are expected to delay their first move until the end of the year, the ECB was thought to have dished out enough tough love. Financial markets still expect a 0.25-point cut on Thursday when Christine Lagarde and fellow policymakers meet in Frankfurt to set interest rates for the bloc. Smiles are likely to be in short supply, however. While a reduction to 4.25% in the main interest rate, if it happens, will cheer borrowers across the eurozone, it is likely to be accompanied by a more equivocal narrative about the year ahead. Too many harsh realities are crowding out a fairytale ending to the topsy-turvy economics of the past four years for the ECB to appear relaxed. Gas prices are rising, oil prices remain high and other commodities remain volatile. Uncertainty about the Middle East, China’s support for Russia in the war with Ukraine, and the US election in November add to growing political uncertainty. UK food prices are 20% higher than in 2021 and the most recent figures from major European economies show inflation rising again. According to statistics body Eurostat, annual price growth across the eurozone is expected to be 2.6% in May, up from 2.4% in April. Both France and Germany have suffered an unexpected increase in inflation. European elections next weekend could also add to anxiety over the economic outlook if moderates lose ground and the balance of power shifts to the extremes. A message from the ECB that rising inflation means interest rates are likely to drop very slowly will be a blow to incumbent politicians seeking re-election on their record from the past four or five years. There is a strong case for arguing that Europe has survived remarkably well in the past two years, considering the potentially disastrous effect of having to import both gas and basic commodities at sky-high prices from outside Russia. Without swift action by Brussels there could easily have been a deep recession and a jump in unemployment. Yet stagnation, while better than recession, is not a basis for hope. There is still a costly war to fight with Russia, and if EU and UK politicians insist on using taxpayer funds for that, there will be little left to spend on healthcare, education or public transport. Privatisation will become the default option when society demands something new, with the inflated cost of the service passing to consumers. Defence budgets are going to balloon unless a decision is taken at the G7 meeting later this month to use Moscow’s frozen assets – the ones deposited by Russia’s central bank in European financial centres – to fund the war and reconstruction of Ukraine. Poland has already increased its defence spending to 4% of gross domestic product. If all European countries, including the UK, follow suit, there will be a considerable war chest at President Zelenskiy’s disposal. But there won’t be much money for anything else on Europe’s agenda. Some European countries, principally Germany, have plenty of room to borrow more. And the EU has proved adept at generating funds itself. As it says, €1.2tn of funding between 2021 and 2027 plus an extra €800bn will help rebuild a post-Covid-19 Europe. It will be money wasted if Ukraine loses the war. Much better would be to ally this spending with a confiscation programme so the Russians can fund the Ukraine’s defence. Otherwise a grim year ahead will become two or three or many more, scarring a generation.",

        "title": "‘More than my weekly wages’: London’s Paddington attraction and the growing cost of kids’ days out",
        "content": "As half-term drew to a close in England, families short on inspiration might have been grateful to learn of a new day out: on Friday, the Paddington Bear Experience opened its doors in London, promising a “unique and fun-filled interactive experience” spanning more than 2,400 sq metres (26,000 sq ft) and including themed rooms, character interactions – and marmalade sandwiches. But the experience comes at a cost: with weekend ticket prices of £49 for adults and £39 for children, a family of four can expect to pay £176 for the 70-minute event – and a lot more should they wish to peruse the books, games and toys available to buy in Mr Gruber’s antiques shop afterwards. The Paddington Bear Experience arrives at County Hall on the Southbank amid an apparent trend towards large-scale immersive “experiences” over traditional family days out, with far higher outlays attached. Also on offer in the same venue is Shrek’s Adventure! London, an immersive tour lasting 70 minutes and costing from £21 a child for a standard ticket this weekend. Elsewhere, on Tottenham Court Road in central London, families can book to play a life-sized version of Monopoly, with tickets starting at almost £50 a player. The phenomenon is not limited to London, however, with the likes of Bristol’s Wake the Tiger Amazement Park offering a “self-guided, multisensory art experience for all ages’’. And in February this year, Glasgow’s now infamous Willy’s Chocolate Experience charged up to £35 a ticket for an immersive attraction but ultimately delivered little more than a couple of jellybeans, a quarter of a cup of lemonade and some plastic props. Last week, families compared Brick Fest Live, an event billed as “the UK’s biggest Lego festival”, held at the NEC in Birmingham, with the Willy Wonka event in Glasgow after they arrived to find it “basically empty”. The growth of large-scale immersive activities is driven by “the demand for captivating, story-led experiences”, said Juliana Delaney, chief executive of Continuum Attractions, whose portfolio includes the Real Mary King’s Close in Edinburgh and Portsmouth’s Spinnaker Tower. “These large-scale immersive interactions remove the guest from their everyday and transport them to an alternative space where they can forget about their day-to-day challenges for a while.” These attractions come with increased operating costs, but strategies such as tiered pricing, VIP packages and “early bird” discounts can still ensure accessibility, she said. “Many are willing to spend on the right experiences that they feel offer them quality, value and memories that last.” But as the cost of living crisis continues and child poverty increases, some believe rising attraction prices risk locking many families out of recreational opportunities across the country. A 2023 poll of more than 1,000 parents and carers by the charity Family Action found that 76% of families worried about the expense of days out because of the cost of living crisis and that more than a quarter planned to forgo them completely during the summer holidays. Ellen Abbott, a single parent to two children aged six and 10 in greater Manchester, said she had cut back considerably this half-term. “It would cost more than my weekly wages to take them to new activities every day, and I’m already conscious of saving for Christmas as they’ve been desperate to go on a Polar Express train ride,” she said, noting that many such activities now require pre-booking weeks or even months in advance. “Even ‘old-fashioned’ museums, galleries and bowling are so costly when you think about snacks, travel and gift shops – especially as a single parent when I’m not usually eligible for family discounts,” Abbott said. Lynn Perry, chief executive of Barnardo’s, said the cost of living crisis had “squeezed household budgets and tipped more families into poverty”. “Many of the people we support are having to make heartbreaking choices about what to cut from their budgets to make ends meet,” she said. “Living in poverty means children miss out on opportunities and the activities that make childhood fun and support their development.” Charities supporting the country’s most vulnerable children and families said they were also feeling the effects of the rising cost of entertainment. “For families caring for children with additional needs, having a simple day out can often be an extra cost that is just unaffordable,” said Ryan Sinclair, chief executive of Happy Days Children’s Charity, which provides days out and experiences for children with a range of conditions, disabilities and challenges. “The cost of living crisis has clearly exacerbated the pressures on parents already struggling to cope, and we work hard to help as many families as we can. However, the increase in requests for support in recent years inevitably means that our resources are becoming more and more stretched.” Liat Hughes Joshi, an author of parenting books, said families should try to resist the “enormous pressure to arrange a packed calendar of expensive days out”. “There are no prizes for being the parent who took their children on the most days out over the school holidays ... so ignore what anyone else is doing,” she said. “It sounds cliched, but being the best parent you can be, in the circumstances of your family, isn’t about theme parks or the latest immersive experience – it’s about time, love and attention.”",

        "title": "Boeing’s largest plant in ‘panic mode’ amid safety crisis, say workers and union officials",
        "content": "Boeing’s largest factory is in “panic mode”, according to workers and union officials, with managers accused of hounding staff to keep quiet over quality concerns. The US plane maker has been grappling with a safety crisis sparked by a cabin panel blowout during a flight in January, and intense scrutiny of its production line as regulators launched a string of investigations. Its site at Everett, Washington – hailed as the world’s biggest manufacturing building – is at the heart of Boeing’s operation, responsible for building planes like the 747 and 767, and fixing the 787 Dreamliner. One mechanic at the complex, who has worked for Boeing for more than three decades, has claimed it is “full of” faulty 787 jets that need fixing. Many of these jets are flown from Boeing’s site in South Carolina, where the company shifted final assembly of the 787 in 2021 in what was characterized as a cost-cutting measure. “There is no way in God’s green earth I would want to be a pilot in South Carolina flying those from South Carolina to here,” the mechanic, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian. “Because when they get in here, we’re stripping them apart.” Managers at Everett “will hound mechanics” to keep quiet about quality-assurance concerns and potential repairs, the mechanic alleged, emphasizing speed and efficiency over safety. He added: “Boeing has to look in the mirror and say: ‘We’re wrong.’” Boeing did not comment on claims that staff have been pressured not to raise concerns about quality. Work at Everett on 787 jets is taking place as part of an established verification program, it said. The company met this week with US regulators to discuss how it plans to address quality-control issues. Executives have recently described how workers have been emboldened to speak up since January, with submissions to an internal portal for safety and quality concerns up 500%. Earlier this year, a panel of experts, which was appointed by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, described a “disconnect” between Boeing’s leadership and workforce on safety, and made 53 recommendations to help resolve its concerns. After January’s blowout, which took place on board a brand-new Max 9 plane, the FAA launched a sweeping investigation. After a six-week audit of Boeing’s production line found multiple failures to comply with manufacturing quality-control requirements, the agency gave Boeing 90 days to outline an action plan and address the panel’s findings. Boeing submitted its proposed plan to the FAA on Thursday. In a statement, the company said it “welcomed” the expert panel’s 53 recommendations. Mike Whitaker, the FAA administrator, told reporters that Boeing had accepted them all. Najmedin Meshkati, who served on the panel, said Boeing’s safety culture has “eroded” over the past two decades, in the wake of its merger with McDonnell Douglas in the late 90s, “under the direct watch of its leaders and board of directors, who have been complicit in and ultimately responsible for its present problems”. “Boeing’s most valuable asset is its highly dedicated and skilled workforce, and, fortunately, most of its systems-related problems are fixable,” Meshkati, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California, said in an interview before the company presented its plan this week. “However, Boeing’s corporate governance and its perpetually cloned [board] needs to be overhauled and diversified,” he added, suggesting that it should move its headquarters back to Seattle and “systematically” implement all the panel’s recommendations. The FAA launched another investigation this month, into production of the 787 Dreamliner, scrutinizing whether Boeing workers in South Carolina completed required inspections on the jet, and whether they “falsified aircraft records”, after Boeing informed the watchdog that it “may not have completed” all checks. Sam Salehpour, an engineer at Boeing, testified in front of Congress in April that the 787 was riddled with quality defects and called for all 787s to be grounded for inspection. Boeing denied his allegations and said it was “fully confident in the safety and durability” of the plane. The mechanic who spoke to the Guardian described how “giant failures” in Boeing’s 787 production line had put enormous pressure on the company as it scrambles to reassure regulators, airlines and passengers. “Right now, we’re in panic mode in Everett,” they said, because Boeing managers “finally figured out that they got more people that have no idea what’s going on, than people that do”. A spokesperson for Boeing said: “As we shared publicly on numerous occasions, we will put all undelivered 787s through our join verification program to ensure every airplane conforms to our exacting engineering specifications prior to delivery to our customers. Airplanes assembled since 2022 do not require this additional join verification work. “In mid-2023, we announced that we would relocate all join verification efforts in Everett so that we can focus our South Carolina team on new airplane production positions. There has been no change to this plan and our team in Everett has continued to complete the join verification program.” Some workers at Everett have characterized the shift of 787 production from Washington to South Carolina as an anti-union move: whereas Washington has a union for mechanics, Boeing’s plant in South Carolina is non-union, and was the site of a contentious union-organizing drive several years ago. Another Boeing employee at Everett, who also requested anonymity, drew a contrast between productivity at the Washington state complex and the North Charleston factory in South Carolina, where final assembly of the 787 was moved but where no union mechanics were hired. “We would build 10 to 12 planes a month, while South Carolina would build just over two, almost three a month,” they said. “I don’t see them ever getting to 10 a month.” A “very robust union-containment strategy” at Boeing is partly responsible for the company’s broader safety problems, said Rich Plunkett, director of strategic development for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (Speea), IFPTE Local 2001, which represents 17,000 employees at Boeing and Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems. In addition to not hiring union mechanics in South Carolina, Boeing has significantly reduced the number of workers who write instructions for machinists in recent years, through outsourcing, voluntary resignations and layoffs. “The existing employees are not the enemy,” said Plunkett. “They’re your solution. And you need to engage them collectively. “Boeing has to implement meaningful non-retaliation policies, demonstrate by walking the talk, and quit threatening their workforce [that] if they can’t do everything they can cheaper that they’re going to send the work abroad. Because Boeing’s globalization is continuing, if not expanding, in the midst of Boeing telling the free world they’re changing the culture.” Some veteran union employees at Boeing draw a link between its current issues and a move by the company more than two decades ago to introduce “team leader” managers, replacing a previous system whereby the most senior, experienced factory workers were in charge. “The team leader isn’t picked by his skill on the airplane – he is picked by his relationship with another manager or another person,” said the mechanic. “Now we don’t have team leads who know what’s up.” Today, the managers “doing the thinking have never done physical labor before”, they added. “There’s no way you can learn how to build an airplane in a school on the third floor. There are a lot of things you can learn in the classroom, but building an airplane is not one of them.” Boeing said: “We value experience as well as other factors such as skill set, performance and leadership that go into making a strong team lead. Our team leads help develop employees while the overall training we provide builds the knowledge and skills of our teammates as they advance in their Boeing career.” Recently, disagreements between Boeing and unions have stalled talks over the creation of a program for employees to raise safety concerns to regulators without fear of retaliation. Speea claimed last month Boeing wanted to control the flow of information to regulators; Boeing said it had offered the union the same deal it had signed with another union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and was willing to negotiate. Boeing did not comment on the company’s position toward unions, criticism tied to the 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas, or complaints about quality-assurance issues.",

        "title": "Finding a job in Ireland is easy. Finding a place to live is the hard bit",
        "content": "Ireland’s economy is “absolutely booming,” says Stephen O’Dwyer, the founder and owner of Dublin’s Tang cafe/restaurant chain. “But it has left people facing a very unequal and difficult society to work in.” At the top of O’Dwyer’s concerns is housing, which is cited by businesses large and small as a significant barrier to Ireland’s economic growth. The capital is not alone: cities from Cork to Limerick report acute housing shortages and rising levels of homelessness. “Housing is such a big issue – probably the No 1 issue businesses face at the moment,” he says. “For most people in the city, finding a job is the easy part. Finding a place to live is very difficult.” In the run-up to this week’s European elections, which take place in Ireland on 7 June, the housing logjam has led to much soul-searching: how can the country hope to fully capitalise on its economic potential without giving people a place to live? After a decade of low investment in all aspects of public infrastructure, when the only new properties being built were the single-dwelling homesteads that dot the countryside, Ireland is building again. Yet construction work is consistently falling behind demand, held back by an exodus of building workers after the 2008 financial crash. Business groups have urged the government to inject more urgency. Ministers say spades are going in the ground as quickly as industry can take on new work. Meanwhile, projects to build data centres, rail connections and hospitals face delays while contractors fight among themselves for skilled workers and the government desperately tries to clear planning backlogs. Emblematic of these difficulties is a €2.2bn children’s hospital due to open in Dublin this year, but only after many delays and a budget that has swollen to four times its original estimate in 2015. Homes shortage O’Dwyer knows from experience the cost of inaction. “We have just lost two guys because they couldn’t find accommodation,” he says. “We had known for some time they were struggling to find accommodation and we had been trying to help them. But no landlord was interested.” The “problem” was that the two men were Algerian asylum seekers. “When the market is oversubscribed to the extent that it is, they are at the bottom of the list,” O’Dwyer says. “But we couldn’t run a business like ours without migrants. Of the 46 staff, we have 19 different nationalities.” Immigration, a topic that was once considered by many in Ireland as a UK problem, has risen up the list of concerns in recent years. Conor Healy, head of Cork’s chamber of commerce, says 49% of people living in the city were not born there and “it hasn’t been a problem”. But refugee encampments along Dublin’s Grand Canal are stretching that tolerance, and demands for measures to prevent influxes of refugees from worsening the housing shortage are rising up the agenda. In many ways, Ireland is suffering from the same constraints as hold back the UK economy – among them infrastructure upgrades that were delayed or cancelled during a decade of austerity; a narrow and underfunded education system that downplays technical skills; and complex planning rules. But unlike the UK, which would need to borrow heavily to start tackling these issues, Ireland has the money to sort things out. With a budget surplus of about €9bn each year, which it puts into a sovereign wealth fund, and one of the lowest levels of public debt in the EU, Ireland could, at least on paper, overhaul its ageing infrastructure, build much-needed homes and invest in skills without worrying too much about how to pay for it all. Ireland’s national income or gross domestic product (GDP) per person is the second-highest in Europe, after Luxembourg, and the employers’ group Ibec expects the economy to expand by 2% this year and 3.4% next year. These figures are driven by the presence in Ireland of multinationals such as Apple and Google, and the 1,500 foreign companies operating in the country, many there to benefit from its famously low corporation tax rate of 12.5%. Ireland has profited from harbouring US tech and pharma businesses that shield profits, in particular on their intellectual property gains, from the watchful eye of Washington’s federal tax authority. But it may not be able to ride that wave indefinitely. Gerard Brady, chief economist at Ibec, believes the era of tax competition is coming to an end, and sees a new age of subsidy competition threatening Ireland’s success at attracting foreign investment. He says: “Corporate tax competition from countries looking to attract inward investment is a second-order threat these days. The biggest threat to the Irish economy, which is one of the most open in the world, is from the fractured global trading environment.” Referring to the Biden administration’s efforts to bring manufacturing back to the US via the $369bn Inflation Reduction Act, he adds: “What we see now is big power blocs looking to dramatically increase support for their own companies through huge amounts of state aid.” From the ashes of the financial crisis In 2010, the situation was very different. Dublin, like Athens, Madrid and Lisbon, had run out of cash in the wake of the global financial crisis. Waves of bankruptcies across its financial and construction sectors forced the Irish government to seek a three-year, €67.5bn bailout by the International Monetary Fund and the EU – equal to 40% of Ireland’s annual national income, as measured by GDP. It lost its Celtic Tiger epithet and spent years in shock, even after it had paid the money back. Some say the government lost the habit of spending even while the economy recovered and tax revenues grew. Paschal Donohoe, minister for public expenditure and reform in the centre-right coalition government, says: “One of the bitter consequences of financial crisis is that we lost many years of housebuilding.” Speaking in his office in the department of finance, next to the taoiseach’s grand office and the National Museum of Ireland in central Dublin, Donohoe says the government is working around the clock to revamp the country’s ageing infrastructure. He needs to spend €165bn to meet his 2021-2030 development plan goals. Last month he reported that capital spending in the first three months of the year reached €1.72bn, which was €549m ahead of a year earlier, but €271m under budget. “Homes are a real focus. How we support local authorities and the private sector to build more homes is the number one priority of that plan,” he says. More than 30,000 homes were completed in Ireland last year and Donohoe says he hopes to push that to 50,000 a year in the near future. For context, Ireland’s population is one-thirteenth of the UK’s, so last year’s Irish total would be the equivalent of building 390,000 homes a year in Britain. The actual figure for the UK in 2023 was 133,000. Transport is another priority, with proposals for a new train link from Dublin airport to the city centre and the beginnings of a Dublin metro system topping the list. But both are unlikely to see spades in the ground until a post-2030 plan has been launched, leaving an €11.6bn overhaul of the bus and tram network as the government’s main achievement before elections expected next year. Improvements in health, education, telecoms and the energy transition to reach net zero soak up much of the remaining public investment funds. Donohoe, a professed anglophile who spent six years working in the UK before going into politics, chairs a development board that examines blockages in the system. Until last year he was finance minister, but under the coalition agreement between his Fine Gael party and Fianna Fáil, he swapped roles with Michael McGrath, though he retains the presidency of the Eurogroup of finance ministers. “Last year we built more homes than at in any period since the Tiger period,” he says. “I am very confident we will be able to maintain that progress this year and into next year.” But are the homes affordable? Donohoe can point to a surge in local authority home building, but with Irish house prices rising by 7.3% in March, compared with 1.1% last August, he is struggling to persuade city dwellers that his plans are making housing more affordable. Wayne Stanley, director of the homelessness charity Simon Communities of Ireland, said the country was suffering from an “over-reliance on the private market” and failure to provide more affordable homes. He adds: “There are 166,000 empty homes across the country, many of them outside urban centres, and there doesn’t appear to be a plan to use them.” Pearse Doherty, Sinn Féin’s deputy leader and finance spokesperson, also criticises the government’s lack of urgency. “The housing crisis is not an act of nature,” he says. “It is the result of government policy. We are suffering from the decision to curtail investment in the aftermath of the financial crash and, even as the economy was recovering, from ramping up investment. “This is a serious problem that is impacting not just those in housing need, but our competitiveness. It is the number one issue on the agenda of the business community when we meet them.” Doherty says a catch-up plan would put more emphasis on funding local authorities to build homes. Private developers would also be forced to build flats for rent at more affordable prices. Brady at Ibec says the state needs to step in to solve the housing crisis. “The scale of the problem is such that the private sector is never going to solve it. Everything we can afford, we can’t do. We can’t get the workers to do the new jobs because they can’t get a house and we can’t build a new house because we can’t get the skilled workers.” It leads, says the writer Fintan O’Toole, to a situation where “Ireland is simultaneously over-developed and underdeveloped”. Tech boom To some extent Ireland’s housing woes have been created by inward investment from the tech and pharmaceutical sectors, which has sent average pay rocketing and in doing so set off a property bidding war. To give a measure of the scale of investment, Intel has established the largest semiconductor factory in Europe just outside Dublin, and Pfizer, which employs 5,000 people across five sites in Dublin, Cork and Kildare, will add another 400 jobs when a $1.26bn expansion of its Dublin plant is finished in 2027. Most big pharmaceutical and medtech companies have operations in Ireland. The country produces about 40% of the world’s contact lenses, as well as all the world’s Botox and the key ingredient in Viagra. Memories of 2019, when Irish ministers feared Westminster’s plans for a hard Brexit would physically isolate Dublin, are fading rapidly. Figures show trade via Northern Ireland has improved and the number of container ships from Dublin and Rosslare bypassing the UK as they head to France has increased dramatically. Neale Richmond, minister for financial services, says Dublin’s insurers have become the main gateway for foreign firms, including London-based insurers, into the EU’s highly regulated market. “Post-Brexit, thousands of jobs have been created here,” he says. Tom McDonnell, co-director of the Dublin-based Nevin Economic Research Institute, says the housing problem has been exacerbated by the arrival of multinational tech and pharma companies, with knock-on effects for school places, childcare and health, and is made worse by the incoming businesses soaking up talent and research funding, leaving crumbs for domestic businesses. The rate of research and development among domestic firms is poor compared with other EU countries, he says, which means many families are doomed to taking permanent low-grade work. “If you want to find people who have broken out of the low-education, low-wage trap, they are virtually nonexistent,” he says. O’Toole agrees, saying much of the innovation in the Irish economy has been outsourced to US multinational corporations, leaving domestic companies devoid of new ideas and products. Alan Sullivan heads one of Ireland’s few domestic manufacturers, Meditec Medical, which makes pressure-relieving mattresses for hospitals and care homes. His sales at home and abroad are under constant threat from cheaper Chinese versions, but he says the higher quality continues to win out. He says the government does support manufacturers like him, but as with O’Dwyer at Tang, his problem is finding skilled staff and keeping them. “Hanging on to good people is always difficult,” he says. “But I think the government is doing all it can in the circumstances.”",

        "title": "‘Yes, Lego car!’: why small electric cars could be about to break the grip of SUVs",
        "content": "Driving through central London in a tiny Microlino electric car, barely visible between the hulking SUVs, it’s surprising to be the focus of so much attention. “Yes, Lego car!” shouts a scaffolder. Made by Micro, the family-owned Swiss company behind the mini-micro kick scooters, and modelled on the bubble cars that had a brief heyday in the 1950s, the two-seater is only 2.5 metres long – marginally smaller than a Smart car. The most unusual feature is its one and only door (there is also a rear hatch for accessing the boot), which is at the front. The windscreen and bonnet swing open to let you in. The Microlino goes on sale in the UK this month, in the face of a trend that is pushing the car industry in the opposite direction. Despite global heating, and the warnings of environmental scientists, the demand for ever larger cars just keeps growing. Nearly half of global car sales were sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), a respected forecaster. The definition of SUVs can be vague (usually something to do with a higher seating position and off-road styling), but the IEA this week said “the shift towards ever larger and heavier cars” is the “defining automobile trend of the early 21st century”. Tiny cars are still a rarity, and the Microlino is enough to cause a stir. Uncountable people double take, wave, laugh and take pictures. Cyclists lean over to chat at traffic lights; a bus driver delays his passengers a few seconds to give a double thumbs up; a taxi driver suggests it could help this reporter’s romantic life. It feels at home nipping around town, although with 136 miles of range and a 56mph top speed it could manage jaunts farther afield. Squeezing into a tiny space between a Bentley and a Land Rover Defender, the Microlino parks face-out under the watchful gaze of a bystander who turns out to be the owner of both luxury cars. This is in the posh London district that gave its name to the “Chelsea tractor”, where the four-wheel drive has become standard issue even if the residents rarely need off-road vehicles to make it to the shops and back. The reach of the SUV now goes far beyond Chelsea, however. David Bailey, a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said different pressures have contributed towards bigger cars. Customer demand for the space and a commanding seating position is part of it. Regulation is another: airbags and emissions control systems (such as AdBlue for diesels) add a larger percentage to costs in smaller cars. “If a firm produces a small car that takes up a space on the production line, and that is an opportunity cost where they could make a more profitable bigger car,” Bailey said. However, he added, “if you make it at volume you can still make a decent profit margin”. Even the Mini has outgrown its name. Perhaps Britain’s best-known car, it was conceived at a time when postwar fuel rationing made efficiency attractive. The original was 3.05 metres long. Then, at a 2011 relaunch, it grew to 3.7 metres. One of the latest versions, the steroidal electric Mini Countryman (“the biggest Mini ever”) has more in common with a Land Rover, at 4.4 metres. Some other brands have gone the same way. Smart’s Fortwo was the most familiar tiny car on European roads, but the new electric models (under part-Chinese ownership) are significantly bigger five-seaters. The results of car growth are not good for the environment. Two hundred kilograms or more in extra weight for SUVs plus the extra drag from a bigger frontal surface area mean burning more fossil fuels. That pushes up carbon emissions by 20%, the IEA said. A quarter of global growth in oil demand last year can be ascribed to petrol SUVs. Electric SUVs use up far more valuable minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt than smaller vehicles, making decarbonisation goals harder. Bigger vehicles also add to tyre pollution, and they make pedestrian deaths much more likely, for women and children in particular. And they take up more space. SUVs need 0.3 sq metres extra, which adds to parking requirements and gums up city streets. By contrast, the tiny Microlino can slip into the smallest of gaps. Colin Walker, head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, is hopeful that the imminent launch of smaller, cheaper electric models such as the Renault 5 and the £14,995 Dacia Spring will help speed the transition from fossil fuels. “One of the main barriers that is holding people back is the lack of smaller, cheaper EVs,” he said. “I’d argue that [manufacturers] were a little slow in trying to build these models.” Of the big western manufacturers, only Stellantis – the owner of Citroën, Peugeot, Chrysler, Vauxhall and others – has ventured into the truly tiny electric car segment. Its £8,095 Citroën Ami has gained something of a cult following despite its 28mph top speed and 46-mile range. It is particularly popular with high school students in France, where the self-proclaimed “urban mobility object” is classed as a light quadricycle, meaning it can be driven by anyone aged 14 or over without a full licence. Yet it is China that is extending its growing electric car dominance into the realm of tiny cars, often based on cheap lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Those on sale in China (but not yet in Europe) include Geely’s £6,000 Geometry Panda, the £3,400 Mini EV from Wuling Hongguang and the £9,100 Baojun Yep, a joint production between SAIC and the US’s General Motors, which offers SUV styling in a tiny package. For slightly larger hatchbacks, the competition is fierce. SAIC’s MG4 has already conquered the UK market, where the brand originated. BYD’s impressive Dolphin is expected to make a big splash in the market for small family cars. Merlin Ouboter, who oversaw the Microlino project and whose father, Wim, made Micro into a household name with its scooters, is hoping that he can steal a march on European rivals in the tiny car segment (although a premium £22,000 price tag and some flimsy parts suggest it has a fair way to go to be a mass seller). “Most of the cars we see on the road today are completely overengineered for their daily use case,” Ouboter said. The Microlino is aimed at the vast majority of journeys (94% in the UK) that are less than 25 miles. For the rest, he envisages greater use of occasionally shared or rented cars. James Nix of the Brussels-based campaign group Transport &amp; Environment says other governments should emulate France, which imposes higher parking fees in Paris for big cars, and higher sales taxes nationally. That could help halt the annual swelling in the size of new cars towards the scale of metal monsters in the US. “Do we as Europeans want to replicate the evolution of the North American car fleet?” Nix asked. “I don’t think that question has been asked at a political level yet.”",

        "content": "Hackers are attempting to sell confidential information including the bank and credit card numbers of millions of Santander customers to the highest bidder. ShinyHunters posted an advert on a hacker forum for the data, which it says also includes staff HR details, with an asking price of $2m (£1.6m). It is the same organisation that claims to have hacked Ticketmaster. In the post outlining the data it claims to hold the hacker collective taunts the bank, stating: “Santander is also very welcome if they want to buy this data.” Santander, which employs 200,000 people including about 20,000 in the UK, confirmed that it had been hacked a fortnight ago. “Following an investigation, we have now confirmed that certain information relating to customers of Santander Chile, Spain and Uruguay, as well as all current and some former Santander employees of the group had been accessed,” it said in a statement issued on 14 May. “Customer data in all other Santander markets and businesses are not affected.” At that time Santander apologised for “the concern this will understandably cause” and said it was “proactively contacting affected customers and employees directly.” “No transactional data, nor any credentials that would allow transactions to take place on accounts are contained in the database, including online banking details and passwords,” it said, adding that its banking systems were unaffected so customers could continue to “transact securely.” In a post on a hacking forum – first spotted by researchers at Dark Web Informer – ShinyHunters claimed it had the data of 30 million customers. It also claimed to have 6m account numbers and balances, and 28m credit card numbers. Santander has not commented on the accuracy of the group’s claims. It is claimed that ShinyHunters has managed to acquire the personal details of more than 500 million Ticketmaster customers, although the company has not yet publicly confirmed the breach. According to reports, authorities in Australia and the US are engaging with Ticketmaster to understand and respond to the incident, with the hackers said to have gained access to the names, address, phone numbers and partial payments details of 560 million Ticketmaster customers. ShinyHunters is said to be demanding a ransom payment of about £400,000 from Ticketmaster to prevent the data being sold on the dark web.",

        "content": "Time to recap….. Euro zone inflation rose in May, in a sign that the goal of fully controlling price rises remains in the distances. Consumer prices jumped by 2.6% this month, on an annual basis; despite this, the European Central Bank is still forecast to cut interest rates next week. Inflationary pressure in the US remained unchanged in April, according to the latest PCE index, which also showed a small slowdown in monthly core inflation. UK house prices returned to growth in May, with average prices rising 0.4% in May despite the drag from high mortgage rates, Nationwide reported. But, the number of mortgages being approved has dropped, Bank of England data for April showed. And in other news… In the City, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has ended the day 46points higher, or 0.55%, at 8277 points. That still means it lost ground this week, for the third week in a row. Europe’s markets also rose today, despite this morning’s pick-up in inflation, with the Stoxx 600 index finishing 0.3% higher. Budget airlines including easyJet and Ryanair have been hit with fines totalling €150m (£128m) by the Spanish government for policies that include charging passengers extra for cabin luggage. In the biggest sanction issued by the Spanish government’s ministry of social rights and consumer affairs, the carriers easyJet, Ryanair, Vueling and Volotea have been penalised after an investigation launched last summer. Under the judgment, the four airlines face being banned from charging passengers for cabin luggage in the future. The Spanish news outlet Cadena SER reported that the fines would total €150m, with the airlines also being censured for charging passengers extra fees to reserve adjacent seats for children and other dependents. More here. The US dollar has taken a knock from today’s PCE inflation report. Against a basket of currencies, the US dollar is down 0.3%- which has lifted the pound to $1.2753. The fact the PCE readings were largely unchanged appears to be giving some confidence that the US is on track for interest rate cuts in coming months, although prices are rising faster than the Fed’s 2% target ….. Wall Street has opened slightly higher, after the PCE index showed US inflation rising in line with forecasts. After some choppy recent sessions, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 55 points or 0.15% at 38,167 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is also 0.15% higher, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite has gained a more modest 0.05%. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, says the small rise in core PCE inflation will be welcomed by the Fed: The Federal Reserve’s favoured inflation measure rose 0.2% MoM. That’s what we need to see to soothe the Fed’s inflation worries, but one is not enough. We need a series of 0.2% readings between now and September, with further slack in the jobs market and more evidence of a cooling consumer spending story. All certainly possible, but by no means guaranteed. Google’s news service is suffering a technicla glitch today, which has left users unable to see updates. Down Detector, which tracks tech outages across the globe, showed a surge in the number of reports that Google News was not working at around 1pm on May 31. While the main search engine seemed to be unaffected, users who clicked on the “news” tab found no stories. Instead, a message appeared on-screen, which said: “Uh-oh! Something went wrong. Please try again.” Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group, has fired over thoughts on the slowdown in PCE inflation in April: The Fed’s preferred core PCE metric rose at the slowest pace this year, up just 0.2% month-over-month This is a step in the right direction as it suggests that Q1 inflation heat was due to idiosyncratic factors that may now be in the process of reversing We’re continuing to see disinflation for durable goods like vehicles and household equipment, as well as groceries On the services side, a lot of the strength is from housing and portfolio management services (which is due to higher stock prices), but we should see disinflation going forward for both these categories So the overall inflation outlook looks good, with disinflation in the pipeline, and that likely keeps the Fed on track to cut twice this year starting in September The drop in core PCE inflation last month was pretty marginal, points out Capital Economics: Excluding food and energy, the core PCE deflator increased by a slightly more modest 0.2% m/m last month, although it was a close run thing, with prices rising by 0.249% to be exact. The annual core inflation rate was unchanged at 2.8% although, at 2.754% in April, there was still some marginal progress. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate-setting committee will be cheered by today’s PCE inflation data, says Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone. This afternoon’s core PCE figures will come as further welcome relief to the FOMC, with the slowest monthly rise this year helping to further cement the bumpy disinflationary path on which the US economy continues to tread. However, as one swallow doesn’t make a summer, one promising PCE print shan’t provide policymakers with the requisite ‘confidence’ that they continue to seek in order to deliver the first rate cut, which remains likely in early-autumn, providing that data continues to show price pressures cooling over coming quarters. Just in: The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure remained unchanged last month, new data shows, which may calm fears that price pressures are accelerating again. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose by 0.3% month-on-month in April, and was 2.7% higher than a year ago, the US Commerce Department reports. Core PCE, closely watched by the Fed, slowed during April – rising by 0.2%, lower than the 0.3% increase recorded in March. On an annual basis, core PCE stuck at 2.8%. Reuters reports that traders are now pricing in about a 51% chance of a rate cut by September, versus about 49% before the report. Just in: Canada’s economy grew less quickly than expected at the start of this year, confirming that the UK had the fastest growth among the G7. The Canadian economy expanded at an annualized rate of 1.7% in the first quarter, new data shows, missing forecasts. That is equal to a quarter-on-quarter rate of just over 0.4%. Economists had expected 2.2% growth while the Bank of Canada had pencilled in 2.8%. Fourth-quarter GDP growth was revised to an annualized rate of 0.1% from 1.0% reported initially, Statistics Canada data showed. This puts Canada towards the top of the growth table for the first three months of the year. UK: +0.6% Canada: +0.425% US: 0.325% Italy: 0.3% Germany: +0.2% France: +0.2% Japan: -0.5% That was quick. Financial and advertising regulators are facing calls to launch an investigation into greenwashing by the UK’s five biggest high street banks, PA Media report. Campaigners wrote to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) on Friday as a new anti-greenwashing rule came into force (see last post for details). The Make My Money Matter campaign – which advocates for sustainable pension investments – said the regulators should review sustainability claims and communications at Barclays, HSBC, Santander, Natwest and Lloyds. The letter coincides with the FCA’s new requirement for financial institutions to ensure retail investors are given “fair, clean and not misleading” information on the green goals of investment products and services. Make My Money Matter said regulators should investigate the “mismatch” between banks’ promotion of climate statements and their real-world activities. Back in the UK, new rules to prevent finance firms making false or misleading claims about the environmental impact of their products have come into effect. The Financial Conduct Authority’s anti-greenwashing rules came into force this morning, and experts predict they could have a substantial impact on the industry. The FCA is hoping the new rules will protect consumers from misleading sustainability claims. The rules could have a far-reaching impact on banks. Clare Wiles, a managing associate in Linklaters’ financial regulation team, predicts they will “capture a huge range of communications” within the finance industry. More here. May’s jump in inflation is a “headache” for the European Central Bank, says Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury: While we still expect the bank to follow through with a 25-basis-point rate cut at its June meeting next week, we are now likely to see a relatively less dovish set of communications that both flag disquiet over inflation, while hinting no immediate rush to ease policy again. Swap markets continue to heavily price in a June rate reduction, but are now not fully pricing in a second cut in the ECB’s deposit rate until December. Eurozone inflation is proving stickier than expected, comments Richard Flax, chief investment officer at wealth manager Moneyfarm. Eurozone inflation rose to 2.6% in May, coming in above the predicted 2.5% and higher than April’s 2.4% growth. This development poses a challenge for the ECB, which is on the brink of reducing rates next week. Additionally, core annual inflation rose in May, raising concerns that it may stabilise around 3% rather than 2% in the coming months. Although this situation might not alter the ECB’s plans for June, future data trends could prompt a reassessment. The challenge here for the ECB is that reaching the last mile target inflation rate of 2% may prove more arduous than anticipated. Vodafone has completed the disposal of its Spanish operations to Zegona Communications for €4.1bn in cash and €900m in the form of redeemable preference shares. The telecoms giant has been undergoing a transformation programme under new chief executive Margherita Della Valle, who has sought to simplify the group and taken action in three underperforming markets where Vodafone’s returns were below the cost of capital. The disposal of the Spanish division, which was announced last October but needed to go through regulatory approvals, is part of Vodafone’s turnaround which also includes a sale of its operations in Italy and a proposed merger with CK Hutchison’s Three in the UK which is currently being considered by the Competition and Markets Authority(CMA), the anti-trust regulator. With the European Central Bank on the eve of deciding on a historic interest rate cut, today’s rise in eurozone inflation adds to doubts about the future path of inflation. So says Bert Colijn, senior economist for the eurozone at ING, who explains that May’s inflation report shows that “the final throws” of getting inflation back to target are not necessarily easy. This means that next week’s ECB meeting may not mark the start of a traditional cutting cycle, even if borrowing costs are cut, as expected. Colijn writes: While many forward-looking indicators remain benign, a hot labour market, continued supply chain disturbances, and a recovery of purchasing power will make for an interesting debate at the ECB governing council as they decide on the path of monetary policy from here on in. Core inflation seems set to decelerate again, but the question is at what pace? Services inflation remains elevated for now but forward-looking indicators do gradually move in the right direction. Still, we expect services inflation to trend around 3.5% towards the end of the year, well above target. If goods demand returns on the back of higher real wage growth, goods inflation could accelerate somewhat again towards the end of the year as supply chain problems still modestly curb supply. This rise in eurozone inflation will make for a “more interesting” European Central Bank policy meeting next week, says Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. He still expects a rate cut on Thursday, though. Core inflation across the eurozone has also risen, which may cause some frowns at the European Central Bank. Inflation, stripping out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, is estimated to have risen to 2.9% this month, reversing the drop to 2.7% seen in April. This is the first rise in eurozone inflation this year. Having ended 2023 at 2.9%, inflation eased in January (2.8%), February (2.6%) and March (2.4%), before holding steady in April. Newsflash: inflation across the eurozone has picked up this month, showing that the squeeze on households is not over. The annual inflation rate across the eurozone is expected to be 2.6% in May, statistics body Eurostat reports, up from 2.4% in April, driven by rising prices in the services sector. Economists had expected a smaller rise in inflation, to 2.5%. That takes CPI inflation away from the European Central Bank’s 2% target, just as investors anticipate an interest rate cut by the ECB next week. According to Eurostat, services inflation rose to 4.1% in May, up from 3.7% in April, while food, alcohol &amp; tobacco inflation slowed to 2.6% (from 2.8% in April). Non-energy industrial goods prises rose by 0.8% per year (down from 0.9%), and there was a small increase in energy prices (up 0.3% year-on-year, compared with -0.6% in April). This follows a pick-up in inflation in Germany yesterday (to 2.8%), and in France this morning (to 2.7%), both on an EU-harmonised basis. Just in: UK lenders approved fewer new mortgages than expected last month, but there’s been a pick-up in the amount borrowed to fund a house move. New Bank of England data shows there were 61,100 mortgage approvals for house purchases in April, down on March’s 61,300, and below forecasts for a rise to 61,500. However, mortgage borrowing rose last month; people borrowed £2.4bn of mortgage debt in April, compared to £0.5bn in March. (mortgage approvals are an indicator of future borrowing). The remortgaging market also cooled: Net approvals for remortgaging (with a different lender) decreased to 29,900, from 33,500, which suggests higher mortgage rates deterred people from shifting to new deals. The ‘effective’ interest rate – the actual interest paid – on newly drawn mortgages increased slightly by 1 basis point, to 4.74% in April. The rate on the outstanding stock of mortgages increased by 7 basis points, to 3.57% in April. Last night, Saudi Arabia announced plans to raise £9bn more capital by selling shares in its national oil company Saudi Aramco. Saudi Arabia will hold a secondary public offering of 1.545 billion Aramco shares, or 0.64% of shares in issue. It is aiming for a price between 26.70 riyal (£5.60) and 29.00 riyal (£6) per share, with most of the shares going to institutional investors. It will launch on Sunday, and should be concluded by next Friday. Bill Blain, strategist at Wind Shift Capital, says the capital is being raised “at a fascinating time”, given recent illness suffered by Saudi Arabia‘s King, Salman bin Abdulaziz. Blain writes: In the next few weeks its inevitable that Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) will become King of Saudi Arabia. His ambition is to firmly establish Saudi as the undisputed leading power in the Middle East, levering that into global power. Saudis’ economic strength is oil. It’s using its wealth to innovate a diversified tech led economy. Although some of the projects at the core of the reinvention of Saudi have already been scaled back due to escalating costs, and its purchase of global sports franchises is generally misunderstood, the plan is to fuel the economy with plentiful investment by the state SWF, The Public Investment Fund. As such, that’s a pretty effective use of the state’s wealth. It’s all change at betting group Flutter this morning. Flutter, which owns FanDuel, Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, Sportsbet, PokerStars, Paddy Power, and Betfair, has completed the migration of its primary stock market listing to New York, from London. Peter Jackson, CEO of Flutter Entertainment, says: Today marks an important milestone in the evolution of Flutter with the commencement of our primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. This closely follows the recent move of our operational headquarters to New York, with both reflecting the increasing importance of the US sports betting and iGaming market to our business. We have a fantastic position in the US, with FanDuel the clear number one operator, and we look forward to this next step on our journey.” But CFO Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson won’t be sharing this journey. Flutter’s board have decided it’s “in the company’s best interests” him to step down from his role as group CFO and executive eirector. Edgecliffe-Johnson was concerned about his ability to spend the “extensive executive management time” in the United States that is now needed, due to family commitments in the UK. So he’s being replaced by Rob Coldrake, currently CFO of Flutter International, with immediate effect. In the City, shares in sport and fashion retailer JD Sports have dropped almost 8% in early trading, after it reported a drop in UK sales in the last quarter. JD has told shareholders that like-for-like sales in the UK are down 6.4% in the 13 weeks to 4 May, which it says is due to “continued promotional discipline” (ie, not cutting prices much) and “tough” comparable sales a year ago. It says: The UK therefore held back the JD fascia overall, although LFL sales growth was achieved in our complementary fascias in North America and in our Sporting Goods fascias. JD’s results (delayed by a couple of days) also show a 66% jump in pre-tax profits for the last financial year (to 3 February), and revenues up 4.1%, which it calls “strategic progress in a challenging market”. CEO Régis Schultz says: We have started the new financial year with Q1 in line with our expectations in a volatile market and we are on track to deliver our profit guidance for the full year. Karen Noye, mortgage expert at wealth manager Quilter, says the UK housing market is showing “considerable resilience” in the face of tough economic conditions, and the affordability squeeze. This is likely in part due to the annual spring bounce as more buyers come to market making it more competitive. However, on an annual basis, prices have increased by 1.3%. The slight uptick suggests some stability, albeit under challenging conditions. “Nationwide’s data reflects a modestly positive trend, but the housing market remains very unpredictable and the growth in house prices is modest. Monthly property transactions have been lower than expected, indicating a cautious market but this is no surprise given the stress the nation’s finances have been under. “Affordability remains a significant challenge, particularly for first-time buyers who face rising mortgage rates and the ongoing pressures of living costs. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, says house prices do not feel poised to rally: High supply is keeping a lid on prices and stubborn services inflation means swap rates are rising and mortgages starting with a ‘3’ feel some way off. Asking prices still need to reflect the fact that buyers currently have tighter budgets and more choice. The general election is unlikely to impact mainstream property markets and if buyers want to know what prices will do next, the next inflation reading rather than the political manifestoes is the best place to start.” Iain McKenzie, CEO of The Guild of Property Professionals, says house prices across the country are in “a state of flux”: This is undoubtedly still a good time to market your property, but it is always worth speaking to an estate agent with a good understanding of prices in your area. While house price figures are useful for giving a top-level overview, they do not give you the granular detail that you might need to get the most out of your sale. Inflation came in higher than expected this month, which makes it increasingly unlikely that the Bank of England will lower interest rates in June. For the time being, people on tracker mortgages will face higher repayments and crucially for buyers it also means that some of the most attractive mortgage offers will be slower to return to the market. Nationwide have also dug into their data, and found that past general elections do not appear to have generated volatility in house prices or resulted in a significant change in house price trends. Their chief economist Robert Gardner says: On the whole, prevailing trends have been maintained just before, during and after UK general elections. Broader economic trends appear to dominate any immediate election-related impacts. It’s a busy morning for Nationwide Building Society. As well as their latest house price data, we’ve also just learned that the UK’s competition authorities have launched a merger inquiry into its £2.9bn takeover of rival Virgin Money. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says it is considering whether the deal – the biggest since the financial crisis – would lead to a substantial lessening of competition within the UK banking sector. The CMA is seeking views from interested parties, by 14 June (details here). Last week, Virgin Money shareholders have voted in favour of Nationwide’s offer, despite one investor claiming the takeover was “likely to sell shareholders very short”. As well as the shareholder vote, the deal still needs formal approval from City regulators the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority, as well as signoff from the CMA. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Whether people feel wealthier can be a key factor in where they place their tick at the ballot box. And those lucky enough to own a house became slightly wealthier this month, new data shows, while a separate report shows living standards have languished for more than a decade. Lender Nationwide has just reported that UK house prices rose by 0.4% month on month in May, ending a two-month run of falling prices. This has lifted the annual rate of house price inflation up to 1.3%, from 0.6% in April, with the average house price now £246,249. Prices rose even though some lenders raised mortgages rates this spring - although costs are below the spike in the months after the 2022 mini-budget fiasco which did such damage to the Conservative party’s popularity. Nationwide reports that the market is showing some resilience. Its chief economist, Robert Gardner, says: The market appears to be showing signs of resilience in the face of ongoing affordability pressures following the rise in longer term interest rates in recent months. Consumer confidence has improved noticeably over the last few months (see chart below), supported by solid wage gains and lower inflation. The general election campaign is unlikely to disrupt the housing market much; Rightmove reported this week that 95% of people planning to move home say the election will not affect their plans. The wider economic picture, though, is that the UK has been suffering weak income growth since the Great Recession. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reports this morning that median incomes grew by just 6% between 2009–10 and 2022–23; before the 2008 crisis, economists would have expected growth of 30% over that 13-year period. The IFS warns that there’s no “silver bullet”, but reforms to taxes, planning, education and more can make a material difference to the UK’s long-term prospects. Mubin Haq, chief executive of abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, says: Unfortunately, living standards have languished for more than a decade. On a range of measures UK performance has been weak, especially in comparison to other wealthy countries. The danger is that stagnation becomes the new normal. This is in no one’s interests and stunts too many futures and too many lives. Key to any future government will be a renewed drive to tackling hardship and improving living standards. Also coming up today New Bank of England data will show how many mortgages were approved last month, another gauge of the housing market’s health. Global investors are bracing for the latest US PCE inflation data, which measures price changes across a wide range of consumer expenses. A strong PCE report could throw more cold water on hopes of early US interest rate cuts, while a weak reading could put them back into play….

        "title": "Boeing production cap extended as regulator steps up safety checks",
        "content": "Boeing faces continued limits on the number of planes it manufactures as well as increased safety inspections after the US aviation regulator called on it to transform its safety culture. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) held a three-hour meeting on Thursday with senior Boeing executives, who outlined the US aircraft maker’s plan to resolve problems with safety and quality control. Boeing has been under increasing pressure since a panel plugging a cabin door on a new Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 blew out during a flight on 5 January, forcing pilots to make an emergency landing and leaving a hole in the side of the plane. That prompted the FAA to temporarily ground all flights with that model. The regulator stepped up its oversight of Boeing after the incident and in late February gave the company 90 days to develop a comprehensive plan to address “systemic quality control issues” and barred it from expanding 737 Max production after the January incident. Boeing presented its plan to the FAA on Thursday. As a result, the FAA said its senior leaders will meet the manufacturer weekly to review its performance metrics, and Boeing must take measures such as strengthening its safety management system, including employee safety reporting. It must also increase internal audits of its production system. The FAA said it wants more safety inspectors to be sent into Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems facilities, as well as having additional inspections at critical points of the production process. Boeing is also required to have a safety management system that ensures a structured approach to identify hazards and manage risk. Mike Whitaker, the FAA administrator, said after the meeting that the regulator would continue its enhanced oversight of Boeing and its suppliers and hold the company “accountable every step of the way”. He added: “Systemic change isn’t easy but in this case is absolutely necessary, and the work is never really done when it comes to the safety of the flying public.” Dave Calhoun, Boeing’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company had presented to the FAA its plan to strengthen its safety management. He said: “Many of these actions are under way and our team is committed to executing on each element of the plan. It is through this continuous learning and improvement process that our industry has made commercial aviation the safest mode of transportation. The actions we are taking today will further strengthen that foundation.” The cap on production of the 737 Max is proving costly to Boeing, whose slowdowns in production can have a knock-on effect on US GDP. Boeing’s chief financial officer, Brian West, last week said the company will not generate cash during 2024. It has also faced delays in China while regulators reviewed batteries used in cockpit voice recorders. Boeing has been under renewed scrutiny in the months since the door plug failure after a whistleblower in April testified in the US Senate that the manufacturer’s engineers had taken shortcuts that could cause further failures. The whistleblower alleged that Boeing retaliated against him for raising concerns. Boeing at the time denied the allegations of retaliation but acknowledged that it still had improvements to make to its culture. Boeing currently faces a US justice department investigation into whether the incident in January violated a previous settlement agreed with Washington after two 737 Max crashes, in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019, that killed 346 people. The two crashes set off the biggest crisis in Boeing’s history, with regulators grounding Boeing’s bestselling 737 Max for nearly two years. The scandal caused orders of 737 Max to plunge, letting Boeing’s bitter European rival, Airbus, build a huge lead in the global aviation market – albeit one held back for several years by the coronavirus pandemic. Airbus is aiming to increase the number of deliveries of new planes from 735 in 2023 to 800 this year. It has only managed that feat twice before, including a record 863 deliveries in 2019. However, Airbus is facing difficulties in ramping up production whichcould result in delays in deliveries to some customers, Reuters reported on Friday. An Airbus spokesperson said the company’s objective to accelerate production of its bestselling A320 aircraft “has not changed” but acknowledged that “the operating environment is complex and not improving”.",

        "content": "Budget airlines including easyJet and Ryanair have been hit with fines totalling €150m (£128m) by the Spanish government for policies that include charging passengers extra for cabin luggage. In the biggest sanction issued by the Spanish government’s ministry of social rights and consumer affairs, the carriers easyJet, Ryanair, Vueling and Volotea have been penalised after an investigation launched last summer. Under the judgment, the four airlines face being banned from charging passengers for cabin luggage in the future. The Spanish news outlet Cadena SER reported that the fines would total €150m, with the airlines also being censured for charging passengers extra fees to reserve adjacent seats for children and other dependents. The Spanish Airline Association (ALA), which represents the airlines, has hit back at the decision, calling the fines “disproportionate”, and pointing out that airlines could still appeal. Ministry sources told the Guardian that the general directorate of consumer affairs had opened up an investigation in June last year after complaints by consumer organisations over “abusive practices” being deployed by the airlines. The investigation focused on four areas, which included charging extra for cabin luggage and seat selection. The government investigation also looked at concerns around a lack of transparency by the airlines over the final price of services when booking online, and the decision to block cash payments at the airport for additional services. The sources said that the final sanction proposals had been put forward to the affected companies weeks ago. The ministry would not confirm the financial amounts each company has been asked to pay. Cadena SER also reported that Ryanair had been censured by the ministry for charging passengers €20 to print off their paper tickets, calling this a disproportionate cost. Facua, one of the consumer groups that filed the initial complaint, welcomed the decision, saying that it had been campaigning for six years to get the government to intervene. ALA, which represents airlines carrying 85% of air traffic to and from Spain, said in a statement that the process was still open and an appeal could be lodged. It also stressed that the practice was completely legal and that European legislation recognised the freedom of airlines to set their fares. It said: “Sanctioning this practice limits the option to pay only for essential services and would force all passengers to contract the cabin baggage transport service, even if they do not need it. “The consumer will be the main victim of this interference by the ministry of social rights, consumer affairs and Agenda 2030 in the European single market and the freedom of tariffs protected by European law.” Ryanair, Vueling and easyJet referred the Guardian to the ALA for a response. Volotea has been contacted for comment.",

        "content": "Tesco is testing the etching or “tattooing” of avocados as a way to cut out the millions of plastic stickers used to label them. The retailer said is was working with a fruit supplier, Westphalia, to scrap the stickers currently used on its extra large avocados and replace them with a laser etching, in a trial launched this month. Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket which sells almost 70m avocados a year, said the scheme would save the use of almost a million plastic stickers on the large version of the fruit, where the technology will be first used. The computer-guided lasers remove a tiny layer from the top of the avocado skin to etch information in less than a second. The process leaves a design that communicates the size or variety of the fruit to customers. The test will take place in about 270 Tesco stores in south-east England and, if feedback from customers is positive, will be rolled out across the group. Under the scheme, Tesco is also testing a switch from plastic trays to more easily recyclable cardboard on some twin-packs of avocados, which could ultimately save more than 20m pieces of plastic a year. Sales of avocados are up by 15% year on year at Tesco, despite concerns about their carbon footprint and fears about ethical standards on farms. Graham Isaac, the general manager of Westfalia Fruit, said: “We are confident that, with a clear focus and united effort as an industry, we will be able to significantly reduce our waste, use natural resources responsibly and protect the environment and biodiversity for all our futures.” Tesco is not the first retailer to test the idea of tattooing labels on to avocados. Marks &amp; Spencer tried out a similar idea with a supplier, Mack, based in Kent, in 2017 and tested it on oranges several years earlier. Its partner, the Spanish company Laser Food, has tested the technology on a range of fruits, from coconuts to apples.",

        "title": "Postal workers union wants Royal Mail staff to have stake in business",
        "content": "The union that represents workers at Royal Mail has called for a new business model for the company that would see workers given a stake in the company and pay tied to growing services and meeting certain social benefits. Dave Ward, the general secretary of the Communications Workers Union (CWU), said that the potential takeover by the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský should provide a moment to overhaul how the company is structured, which could mirror that of US-style public benefit corporations. On Wednesday, the takeover of Royal Mail by Křetínský’s EP Group moved closer after the postal service’s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), said it had accepted a £3.57bn cash offer. Included in the deal were a number of undertakings and contractual commitments agreed by Křetínský’s team, such as retaining the Royal Mail’s universal service obligation (USO) to deliver first-class mail six days a week for the next five years. They also include five-year guarantees over Royal Mail’s branding and maintaining a UK headquarters. Ward told the Guardian that the union felt the agreements did not “go far, or long, enough”, and would be meeting Křetínský early next week to obtain further assurances about worker protections. He also said the union was working on putting together a proposal for a new business model for Royal Mail, for which it would seek economists’ backing, and be put to Křetínský and the government in the coming months. He said: “We will be putting that forward in a serious way and are hopeful a Labour government would back it. We are serious about it, and will keep pushing it, and start campaigning for these type of objectives to be agreed.” One of the models the union was looking closely at was a plan to make Royal Mail a “public benefit company”, either under Křetínský’s ownership or if IDS remains a stock market-listed company. The union has said the model would mirror that of the public benefit corporations that have become increasingly common in the US. Such for-profit companies include a charter that sets out actions and obligations that it will take on for the public benefit. Ward said: “Whereas a private company will have a mission to its shareholders, I think a public benefit company would very much spell out what its purpose is and what its objectives are.” The new model would also include a restructuring of the governance of the company, with worker and customer representation on its board, as well as other operating boards, such as the investment, pensions and remuneration committees. Ward said: “The remuneration board for management is key, and we would push very strongly that in a public benefit company, remuneration would need to be linked far more clearly to the mission. Rewards would be given on growing the company, growing revenue, growing jobs and services, and elements based on delivering quality.” In addition to more representation on boards at the company, the CWU said it would look at promoting a model that would give workers a bigger stake in the company. Ward suggested that the union was exploring the idea for the workforce to own a certain percentage of the company, but also through mechanisms such as mandatory profit sharing, as used widely in France. A vote by IDS shareholders will take place at its annual general meeting on 25 September. The government will then scrutinise the sale of the formerly state-owned service to a foreign buyer under the National Security and Investment Act, which gives ministers the power to block the sale of companies that are considered to be part of critical national infrastructure. The CWU suggested that this could mean an official green light for the takeover may not come until Christmas. In a rare interview yesterday with Reuters, Křetínský, who is known as the “Czech sphinx” due to his reluctance to speak in public, said that he was looking to seek ways to allow British citizens to invest in Royal Mail even if it is taken private. The EP Group boss, who owns a stake in West Ham football club and Sainsbury’s, also suggested that he could invest up to £400m to install 20,000 new parcel boxes across the UK for package deliveries. This would be a 14-fold increase on the 1,361 the Royal Mail has in place.",

        "content": "Retailers have called on the government to rethink business rates and planning laws to revive high streets and shopping centres after visitor numbers fell again in May. Shoppers at stores on high streets, shopping centres and retail parks decreased by 3.6% in May, maintaining a trend that began last summer as a mini-boom in high street visits after the pandemic lockdowns petered out. Shopping centres were the hardest hit but all three types of retail destination were down as poor weather combined with negative consumer sentiment and the shift to working from home and online shopping to hit visitor numbers. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium trade body, which represents most major retailers, said: “With an election only five weeks away, political parties have a role to play by having policies that mean retailers can invest in rejuvenating shopping destinations across the UK. “A broken business rates system and outdated planning laws are holding back the industry – politicians of all stripes must address these issues. This will boost economic growth, lift consumer spirits, and help drive more shoppers back to our high streets and other retail destinations.” Labour has pledged to replace business rates with a new system of business property taxation as part of a five-point plan to revive high streets, while the Conservatives have held several consultations on the matter – but failed to change the system during their time in office. Retailers were still hopeful an improvement in the weather and events such as the Olympics and football’s European Championships would encourage shoppers to hit the high street, said Dickinson. Diane Wehrle, an expert on town centres at Rendle Intelligence and Insights, said poor weather would have reduced visitor numbers but the drop was led by an “underlying structural shift” away from physical shops as well as households’ efforts to save money because of a surge in the cost of essentials such as food and energy bills. “Wage inflation is now outpacing price inflation but there’s a lag as time is required for consumers to react. They have had a year of struggling and probably using their savings.” She added that the shift to working from home had enlivened some smaller towns but led to quieter streets in big cities, particularly on Mondays and Fridays. On the positive side, fewer shoppers did not necessarily mean less money spent in shops as people were doing less browsing and those who visited town centre were more inclined to spend.",

        "title": "WeWork eliminates $4bn in debt after judge approves bankruptcy plan",
        "content": "A US bankruptcy judge approved WeWork’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan, enabling the struggling shared office space provider to eliminate $4bn of debt and handing control over to a group of lenders and real estate tech firm Yardi Systems. Days after Adam Neumann, co-founder and ex-CEO, confirmed he had shelved a bid to buy the business, WeWork said it expected to emerge from bankruptcy next month. The company claimed it was now positioned for “sustainable, profitable growth”, raising the prospect of it breaking even after years of steep losses. WeWork used its bankruptcy to negotiate a significant reduction in future rent costs from its landlords, ultimately reaching deals to save $8bn in future rent costs. The company also canceled leases at about 160 of its 450 locations during bankruptcy. David Tolley, CEO, said: “In one of the largest and most complex restructurings, we have achieved extraordinary outcomes. Over the last year, we have also seen strong demand across the WeWork system and increased our member net promoter scores.” WeWork filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last November in order to renegotiate these agreements. At its peak, the company had been valued at $47bn as investors including the Japanese multinational SoftBank lined up to back it. As it prepared to go public in 2019, however, analysts gave it a far lower valuation. After it eventually went public, in 2021, its market valuation tumbled to less than $50m. Neumann, 45, stepped down from WeWork in 2019 after its initial failure to go public, and criticism of the firm’s internal culture on his watch. He landed on his feet, however, launching Flow – a real estate venture which raised $350m from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz in 2022. As Neumann and Flow sought to buy WeWork, his former company said he failed to offer a high enough price to win over the company’s lenders, who preferred to take an equity stake as part of the bankruptcy deal.

        "title": "Business manifestos: six pre-election proposals touted by UK industry",
        "content": "Business interest groups are jostling for influence over political parties’ priorities before the 4 July election. Here are some of the big ideas being touted by the UK’s largest industry bodies in their own manifestos. Workplace savings schemes The Building Societies Association has been calling for the introduction of a workplace savings scheme that would help build up the financial resilience of UK households. Currently, 14 million people have less than £100 in savings – and 9 million have no savings at all, according to the Money and Pensions Service. Under the scheme, a set amount of savings would be deducted directly from payrolls by companies with more than 250 staff, similar to the way pensions work today. The BSA is not asking for tax-free treatment or matching contribution from employers, in the hope of making the programme as simple and speedy as possible. Boost sick pay The Association of British Insurers is calling for more generous laws that would boost sick pay, provide it from the first day of leave and extend the scheme to lower earners. The ABI also wants the next government to provide sick pay for people returning to work with reduced hours, and to ensure self-employed people also receive support. Currently, only workers classed as employees – rather than freelancers or contractors – are eligible, and they must earn an average of at least £123 a week. Those who qualify receive up to £116.75 a week for up to 28 weeks, minus the first three days. The ABI says small and medium-sized businesses should also be refunded for statutory sick pay costs if they provide effective health services and return-to-work support. Together, these policies could not only boost productivity across the UK economy but also reduce health and protection payouts by specialist insurers and boost take-up of insurer-supplied health and wellness services. Make big tech and social media pay for fraud The City lobby group UK Finance is calling on the next government to bring in scams legislation that would force big tech and social media companies to help reimburse victims, and spend more than £40m per year to combat fraud, including on their platforms. That would include a new fraud and scams bill to consolidate a current voluntary scheme where tech firms agree to reduce fraud through their platforms and services. UK Finance also wants online platforms, internet service providers and tech companies to be covered by the economic crime levy, forcing them to pay more than £40m per year towards the cost of tackling economic crime. The lobby group also wants firms to help reimburse victims of fraud. At present, most of the cost of reimbursing fraud victims falls to banks. Government-appointed AI champion for small and medium-sized businesses The British Chambers of Commerce says that while AI can help level the playing field for smaller businesses, most do not understand how to make the most out of the technology and feel vulnerable to new threats including cyber-attacks. It is now pushing for the next government to create a “framework of trust”, including through a new AI programme and the appointment of an AI champion that would support digital skills and development in small to medium-sized enterprises. “A new government must provide the right support to businesses to make the most of these radical advancements and no small business should feel left behind. An AI champion, introduced by a new government, will ensure that is not the case,” the BCC said Ban smart motorways The AA is calling on politicians to scrap what it says is “the failed experiment of ‘smart’ motorways”, which were originally intended as a way to ease congestion without spending money on widening roads, by using what was previously a hard shoulder – or breakdown lane – for regular traffic. The AA believes the hard shoulder should be reinstated, saying a third of drivers currently avoid using the inside lane due to fear that broken-down vehicles may be ahead, and emergency vehicles now struggle to get to crashes due to severe congestion. Make the annual budget a fixed date in the political calendar To revitalise the economy, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is proposing three pillars of fiscal policy reform. First, use net worth of the public sector as a target of public policy, which would provide a better measure of the sustainability of public debt. Second, discount the amount of public infrastructure investment from the way the government measures the deficit, ensuring it is separated out from day-to-day spending. Third, make the budget, and other fiscal events, fixed dates in the calendar. This would ensure budgets are not influenced by the short-termism of party politics, or goals such as winning elections. • This article was amended on 20 June 2024. Information provided by UK Finance led an earlier version to suggest that tech and social media firms would be asked to pay up to £40m towards reimbursing victims of fraud. The lobbying firm has since confirmed that this figure does not relate to reimbursing victims of fraud, but to tackle all forms of economic crime in the UK, including fraud.",

        "title": "Eurozone unemployment falls to record low; US GDP growth revised down – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to recap The US economy grew at a slower pace in the first quarter than initially reported, as consumer spending slowed. US GDP rose at an annualized pace of 1.3% in January-March, below the previous estimate of 1.6%, fresh Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows. The data shows America’s economy had less momentum than expected at the start of the year. But in Europe, the jobs market remains solid. Eurozone unemployment fell to a new alltime low last month, at 6.4%. In the UK, the British Chambers of Commerce is urging the next government to make improving relations with the European Union a key part of its drive to revive the economy. In the financial markets, the FTSE 100 has shrugged off fears over sticky inflation, and is up 46 points or 0.55% in afternoon trading. But in New York, Wall Street is being held back by a 19% slump in Salesforce’s shares after it missed analyst forecasts last night. Over on Wall Street, shares in enterprise software maker Salesforce have plunged by 19% after it disappointed analysts last night. Salesforce reported revenues of $9.13bn for the first quarter of this year, below forecasts of $9.15bn. It also predicted that second quarter revenue would be between $9.2bn and $9.25bn, below analyst forecasts of $9.35bn. Analysts at Saxo say: [Salesforce’s] revenue outlook came in lower-than-expected highlighting that the current demand for AI workloads is not currently translating into higher revenue growth for Salesforce. Top brass at Burberry have paid the price for a disappointing year for the luxury goods maker. Burberry’s annual report, released, today, shows that chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd had not earned a bonus for last year. This pulled Akeroyd’s total pay for the year to 31 March 2024 down to £1.3m, from £4.3m the previous 12 months (when he had received a £1.3m bonus and £1.7m to buy him out of bonus and share awards for leaving his position as boss of rival Versace). Danuta Gray, chair of Burberry’s Remuneration Committee, explains: The Committee judged that progress was made on refining our brand image, evolving our product and strengthening distribution, resulting in some of the strategic objectives being partially met. However, in light of the business performance and broader shareholder experience, the Committee and Jonathan Akeroyd agreed that it would not be appropriate for him to receive an annual bonus for FY 2023/24. CFO Kate Ferry would receive an annual bonus for FY 2023/24 of £121,500, representing 9% of her maximum bonus. Burberry’s profits fell by 40% last year; in the last 12 months, its share price has halved. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits has risen slightly, but still remains low on historical terms. There were 219,000 fresh ‘initial claims’ for jobless support last week, an increase of 3,000. The initial claims data is a proxy for the number of workers laid off by US companies and has been low in recent years as firms have held onto labo(u)r. Today’s US GDP report also shows that disposable personal income by 5.3% in the first quarter Inflation took quite a bite out of that increase; real disposable personal income increased 1.9%. Both figures have been revised higher. Newsflash: The US economy grew more slowly than first thought at the start of this year. US GDP increased at an annualized rate of 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024, according to the second estimate of gross domestic product, just released. That’s the equivalent of quarterly growth just over 0.3%. Previousl, the Bureau of Economic Analysis had estimated that GDP rose at an annualized rate of 1.6%, or 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, which was already the weakest rate in almost two years. Today’s update primarily reflected a downward revision to consumer spending, says the BEA. Today’s report shows that consumer spending, exports, and state and local government spending all decelerated in the January-March quarter; a downturn in federal government spending also weighed on growth. But, this was partly offset by an acceleration in residential fixed investment. Speaking of fiscal rules (see previous post), Oxford economics professor Sir Dieter Helm last week published a very interesting blog post about the fiscal rules, looking at how both parties are pledging to be responsible. But, he warns, this involves the “fudge” of relabelling capital maintenance as investment. Prof Helm writes: Both claim that the days of having the cake of tax reductions and the cake of higher spending are over. Tax cuts will mean spending cuts and spending increases will mean higher taxes. No more Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. The sinners have apparently repented. Confronted by the promise of a miracle, here are several possible responses. The first is simply to believe them. The sinners have repented. “Oh Lord, I promise to be a good and a trustworthy steward of state finances. I won’t sin, I promise, even if I/my Party has repeatedly done so in the past. This time will be different, here are my fiscal rules and I promise to stick to them.” The second is to assume that, when the inevitable expenditure pressures become irresistible, taxes are going to go up. The pressures on health spending, more defence, net zero, and workers’ rights in the public sector will simply overwhelm the next government, and possibly as early as spring 2025. Tax cuts will prove unsustainable. Tax increases will be inevitable. The third is to assume that more borrowing will be resorted to, and that it will be the bond markets that bite back, imposing ex post discipline in response to ex ante breaking the new rules. The trick will be to continue pretending that current spending can be relabelled as “investment”. The next government must revise the fiscal framework in order to raise living standards and unlock spending on health, infrastructure and housing, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In January, Keir Starmer ruled out breaking Labour’s fiscal rules to meet its green investment targets if it wins the election. But the current rules are arbitrary, NIESR said, and must be broken or redesigned if the government’s aim is higher growth and higher living standards. The UK fiscal framework was set up with the aim of making public debt sustainable, in other words to ensure that the government is borrowing at a level that means it can meet its payment obligations while having the room to respond to economic shocks. The current framework states that the debt-to-GDP ratio should be falling in the fifth year of forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility, and that net government borrowing should not exceed 3% of GDP. NIESR said that such fiscal targets are arbitrary. The Institute for Government has said that successive governments have gamed the fiscal rules, by claiming to be adhering to fiscal discipline while announcing short term giveaways and longer term tax rises or spending cuts that never materialise. Many long-term public investment projects do not make returns within five years, NIESR said, which stymies public investment that could help improve the debt to GDP ratio. To revitalise the economy, NIESR is proposing three pillars of fiscal policy reform. First, including the net worth of the public sector as a target, which provides a broader measure of the sustainability of public debt. Second, discounting public infrastructure investment from the deficit measure, separating it out from day-to-day spending. Third, the government could establish fixed dates for fiscal events like the budget, in the same way that interest rates are decided by the monetary policy committee at set dates in the calendar. This would insulate budget announcements from short-term political goals, like winning elections, at the expense of long-term economic strategy, NIESR said. Britain’s manufacturers have also issued a manifesto for the warring political parties to digest. Make UK are hoping for a “bold economic vision” that puts the importance of the economy across every Ministerial portfolio. That, they say, would spur growth and help the UK compete with the US and China in the race to develop green technologies. Make UK are calling for five specific measures in the first 100 days of the new government – including a focus on where to stay aligned with Europe, and where to diverge…. Announce a long-term modern Industrial Strategy to underpin all economic policymaking which has cross Government commitment. This should be backed by the re-introduction of an Industry Strategy Council and a new Cabinet Office backed Committee to ensure the implementation of the Strategy across Government Align the UK CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) with the EU CBAM in terms of timescale and design to provide a level playing field with the EU Commence a root-and-branch review of the Apprenticeship Levy as a funding mechanism, as well as the wider apprenticeship system Re-establish an updated, modern Manufacturing Advisory Service Establish a mechanism for ongoing and active consultation with industry to decide where it is appropriate to maintain alignment with EU regulatory changes or, where opportunities for divergence might apply. A Bank of England facility which gives commercial banks cheap access to funds has seen record demand, again, amid worries that the money markets are running short of cash. The BoE allocated over £17bn of one-week funds in its latest short-term repo operation this morning, the largest take-up since the facility was launched in October 2022. The repo operation allows banks to borrow from the BoE at Bank rate, in return for handing over high-quality assets as collateral. It is meant to keep short-term market interest rates in line with Bank Rate by ensuring banks don’t need to pay more to access reserves in the money markets. But there are concerns that banks are tapping the short-term repo because market liquidity which is being drained as the BoE continue to sell bonds acquired through years of quantitative easing (QE). This “quantitative tightening” (QT) scheme involves the Bank selling bonds back to the market, leading to a drop in liquidity. The Financial Times reported yesterday that analysts at Barclays, Bank of America and NatWest believe this scarcity of cash could cause the BoE to slow down the process of shrinking its balance sheet when it reviews its QT policy in September. In another boost for Europe’s economy, euro-area economic confidence has improved this month. The European Commission’s monthy sentiment indicator has risen to 96 this month, up from 95.6 in April. However, economists had expected a larger rise. Readings for industrial confidence also ticked up. Europe’s “strong job market” is driving its economic recovery, says Bert Colijn, senior economist for the eurozone at ING: Following this morning’s drop in the eurozone unemployment rate, Colijn says: Unemployment was already sitting near historic lows during the period of stagnation. In April, unemployment dropped from 6.5 to 6.4%, once again reaching the lowest point since the eurozone was founded in 1999. The strong job market is helping the economic recovery as it keeps wage growth elevated, and has allowed purchasing power to recover after the inflation spike. The question is whether the economic pickup will result in lower unemployment from here. We doubt it. Expectations for employment for both services and industry have actually trended down despite better economic prospects and we expect that the modest economic recovery will largely result in productivity gains. Newsflash: unemployment across the eurozone has fallen to a new record low, a week before Europeans head to the polls for the European Parliament elections. Statistics body Eurostat reports that the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate across the euro area fell to 6.4% in April, down from 6.5% in March. That’s the lowest since the single currency was created, Eurostat data shows. In the wider EU, the jobless rate remained at 6%. This suggests that the higher interest rates imposed by the European Central Bank to fight inflation is not hurting the labour market. Eurostat estimates that 13.149 million persons in the EU, of whom 10.998 million in the euro area, were unemployed in April, adding: Compared with March 2024, unemployment decreased by 103 thousand in the EU and by 100 thousand in the euro area. Compared with April 2023, unemployment increased by 95 thousand in the EU and decreased by 101 thousand in the euro area. Across the EU, unemployment was highest in Spain (at 11.7%) and Greece (10.8%) in April, and lowest in Czechia (2.7%) and Poland (3%). At its peak, during the eurozone crisis in 2013, eurozone unemployment rose over 12%, but then fell steadily – before a brief spike in the Covid-19 pandemic. The Bank of England has been doing its best to keep out of the general election campaign. Earlier this week it cancelled all speeches by its policymakers for the duration of the upcoming 4 July General Election, meaning we shouldn’t hear any public statements from central bank officials until the public has voted. That would prevent the Bank committing news, by commenting on the state of the economy, or hinting when it might lower borrowing costs. Now, though, Rishi Sunak has piled into the void by claiming that a vote for the Tories is a vote for cuts to interest rates. Sunak told The Times: “Of course it is, because we are the party who has committed to bringing down inflation, which is a necessary condition for bringing down interest rates. And I think people can see we have delivered that. And that allows us to think about the future in a more positive and confident way.” Inflation is a funny beast – politicians are desperate to blame global factors when it’s going up, but rush to take the credit when it falls. And either way, as the Bank of England is independent, it gets the credit for controlling prices (and the blame for losing control). Anyway, Labour are warning that they would be starting from a difficult position if they win the election. Darren Jones, Labour’s shadow Treasury minister, ruled out rises to income tax, national insurance or VAT, adding: The fiscal inheritance is going to be really hard, it’ll be the worst that any party has inherited since the second world war. A “do not travel” alert has been issued after a freight train derailed on a major route between England and Scotland, PA Media reports. Services are being cancelled and delayed because of the incident on the West Coast Main Line between Carlisle and Oxenholme Lake District on Wednesday night, National Rail Enquiries added. National Rail says: A derailed freight train between Carlisle and Oxenholme Lake District means some lines are blocked. Trains may be cancelled, revised or severely delayed by up to 60 minutes. Major disruption is expected until 14:00. Train operators Avanti West Coast and TransPennine Express issued the “do not travel” alert, urging passengers not to attempt to use their services for journeys between Preston and Scotland on Thursday. Ticket holders can delay journeys until Friday or travel with other operators. The cost rises hammering UK households has slowed in the last quarter. The Office for National Statistics reports that UK household costs, as measured by the Household Costs Index (HCI), rose 4.4%, slowing from the annual rate of 5.3% in January 2024. That chimes with the latest inflation data, which showed a slowdown in price rises this year. Interestingly, higher income households saw the highest inflation rate. Here’s the details: By comparison, household costs rose 5.0% for high-income households (decile 9) and 3.9% for low-income households (decile 2). By tenure type, mortgage and other owner occupier households had the highest annual inflation rate of 5.5%, reflecting rising mortgage interest payments; by contrast, the rate for outright owner occupiers was the lowest at 3.3%. Private renters’ HCI inflation rate was higher than social and other renters, at 4.6% and 4.3% respectively; this follows a period between October 2023 and January 2024 where the two groups had similar inflation rates. Non-retired households continued to experience a higher annual rate of inflation (4.8%) than retired households (3.4%). Households with children’s annual inflation rate fell to 4.8% while households without children fell to 4.2%. In the property sector, the number of homes for sale in the UK is at the highest level in eight years, according to website Zoopla. Zoopla reports that the supply of homes for sale is 20% higher than this time last year, with £230bn worth of housing for sale, up £45bn on this time last year. This is likely to keep a lid on house price rises this year, Zoopla suspects, even though the upcoming general election could slow the pace of new sales in the coming weeks. Zoopla also reports that there were modest house price falls across Southern England, as the north/south divide in annual house price growth continues. They say: This split in house price inflation is most evident at a city level with the the strongest house price growth in Belfast (+3.6%), Burnley (+2.5%) and Bolton (2.4%), and the highest house price falls in Ipswich (-3%), Hastings (-2.7%) and Norwich (-2.4%). Those IT problems at TSB appear to be solved! A TSB spokesperson tells us: “We’re aware some customers had issues logging into our app and online banking this morning. This issue is now resolved and we’re sorry for any inconvenience it caused.” Another day, another problem with Britain’s banking apps. Today it’s TSB whose customers are reporting problems accessing their accounts. According to Downdetector, there was a spike in reports of glitches at TSB Bank this morning. Many customers are posting on social media that they can’t get their app, or internet banking, to work: TSB is telling customers that it’s aware they are experiencing issues with its digital services, and working hard to resolve it. A TSB spokesperson says: “We’re aware that some customers have had difficulty logging into the app and online banking. We’re sorry for any inconvenience and are working hard to resolve it as soon as possible.” They added that the issues were “intermittent” meaning that in some cases, customers were blocked but later able to get through on subsequent login attempts. On Tuesday, NatWest’s banking app crashed for several hours, leaving thousands of frustrated customers across the UK without access to their accounts. TSB customers are used to technical problems; in 2018, a planned IT upgrade turned into a full-scale crisis, with up to 1.9 million customers locked out of their accounts for days. City regulators later fined TSB £48m for “widespread and serious” failings in its IT migration. Banknote and passport printer De La Rue is in talks with suitors interested in buying each of its core divisions following a strategic review. The Basingstoke-based group, which prints banknotes for the Bank of England and other central banks across the world, said it has spoken with “a number of parties who have made proposals” related to either its currency or authentication operations. Nevertheless, it stressed that there is no certainty that interest will result in any deal. Clive Whiley, chairman at De La Rue, told shareholders this morning: “Since my appointment a year ago, the board has considered a broad range of possible strategic alternatives including transactions with multiple parties which may involve a combination with, or the sale of, the group’s divisions. “The board confirms that the discussions with the relevant parties are advancing, and we expect to update further at the time of the full year results in July.” De La Rue shares have jumped 5% this morning. Shares in online car marketplace Autotrader are roaring ahead, after it reported a jump in sales and earnings for last year. Autotrader’s revenues increased by 14% in the year to 31 March, while operating profits increased by 26%. Autotrader benefited from a “robust” market for used cars, which are selling faster than before the pandemic as supplies gradually improved. The new car retail market has been more challenging, though, with discounting starting to return to the market. Autotrader’s share have jummped 12% this morning, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100 share index. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at interactive investor, says: High interest rates mean it can still be expensive for people to finance the purchase of a vehicle, and it’s interesting to see Google taking an interest in the UK motoring market. Costs generally for businesses also remain elevated, while potential for forecourt consolidation persists as operators such as Cargiant and Motorpoint look to grow. On the upside, Auto Trader is still the dominant market player and continues to spend on innovation. More and more dealers are trialling its ‘Deal Builder’ product, which allows car buyers to value their part exchange vehicle, apply for finance, and reserve a vehicle online. Group net bank debt has also reduced significantly. In London, the FTSE 100 index has opened in the red, down 16 points at 8167 points, the lowest since 2 May. European markets are also sagging, with the Stoxx 600 down 0.2% in early trading. South Africa’s rand has fallen over 1% against the US dollar today, as early results from the South African general election come in. Early results from yesterday’s poll in South Africa’s election suggest the governing African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority, although it is still expected to remain as the largest party. Reuters has the details: With results in from 10% of polling stations, the ANC’s share of the vote in Wednesday’s election stood at 42.3%, with the pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA) on 26.3% and the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) on 8.1%, data from the electoral commission showed. If the final results were to resemble the early picture, the ANC would be forced to make a deal with one or more other parties to govern - a situation that could lead to unprecedented political volatility in the coming weeks or months. The rand is down 1.2%, at 18.67 to the US dollar. Baroness Martha Lane Fox, president of the BCC, is urging politicians to focus on helping businesses: “In the frenzy of the election campaign, it’s crucial that all politicians focus on the power of British business. “As I travel across the UK meeting Chambers and their businesses, I hear amazing stories of people determined to grow their businesses and make a difference in our remarkable country. But time and again businesses tell me they want to see a long-term vision for the economy.” “Our manifesto showcases practical ideas on how politicians can help companies successfully navigate the challenges and opportunities our economy faces. It’s a blueprint for boosting productivity and a pathway to higher growth. “Whichever party is in power after July 4th the immediate focus must be on implementing our five-point-plan for business. The stakes for business from the next government could not be higher.” UK businesses are urging the next government to make improving relations with the European Union a key part of its drive to revive the economy. The British Chambers of Commerce Election Manifesto, published today, cites improved relations with the EU as one of its five priorities, saying this would help lower costs and boost trade. The BCC, which operates over 50 UK Chambers across the country, is calling for: An Industrial Strategy with green innovation at its heart. Better skills planning, bringing businesses and training providers together. Business rates reform to encourage growth and investment. Improved relations with the European Union to cut the costs for business. A Government appointed AI champion for SMEs to spearhead uptake of new technology. Shevaun Haviland, director general of the BCC, says this isn’t about reversing Brexit, explaining…. “The EU is the UK’s biggest market, so we urgently need to get a better trading relationship with our closest neighbour. It’s not about rewriting the referendum result, it’s about cutting red-tape and promoting trade. Both the Conservatives and Labour have been criticised for not focusing on the impact of leaving the EU in this referendum, with former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine warning the election campaign will be the “most dishonest in modern times”. UK food importers of food from the EU have warned that new post-Brexit checks introduced this spring will push up costs, and create painful delays at the border. Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, has caused further jitters by warning yesterday that the US economy risks stagnation – the toxic mix of rising prices and slow growth. Speaking at a Wall Street conference yesterday, Dimon warned that the past five years of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus risked tipping the US into deflation. Dimon said: “I’m not saying it’s going to happen, I just give the odds much higher than other people,” Dimon added. “I look at the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus that has taken place over the last five years—it has been so extraordinary, how can you tell me it won’t lead to stagflation?” “It might not….But I, for one, am quite prepared for it.” Dimon also explained that JP Morgan is prepared both for a soft landing, and something rather bumpier, saying: “If we have a soft landing and rates stay where they are, come down a little bit—which is what the world expects, everyone’s fine. If you have a harder landing with stagflation you’re going to see a lot of stress and strain in the system from banks to leveraged companies to real estate to a whole bunch of stuff.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Fears over sticky inflation – and even the dreaded stagflation – are hitting the markets this week. Investors are growing more anxious that global interest rates will stay higher for longer, a worry that has knocked shares in recent days, as the yields – or rate of return – on government bonds push higher. Last night, the UK’s FTSE 100 index fell for the sixth day in a row and traders are bracing for further losses today. Central banks are attempting to slow growth through high interest rates to dampen inflation, but without cooling their economies so much that unemployment jumps. But with US inflation running at 3.4% last month, still well over the 2% target, confidence that this soft landing can be achieved is faltering. Yesterday, inflation in Germany came in higher than forecast. As Mizuho Bank said in a commentary: “Hotter and stickier than expected global inflation appears to be taking the air out of asset markets. In other words, “Goldilocks” coming undone. And worries about adverse demand impact from higher rates seeping through.” Yesterday, a surpringly weak auction of US debt sent fresh jitters through trading floors, with buyers demanding higher rates as they bid for the bonds. Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at capital.com, explains: A rise in global yields is forcing a re-rating in global equity prices, with Wall Street falling further overnight. Upward pressure on yields was compounded by a weak seven-year auction, reigniting fears about how the US will fund its rising deficit. Although the European Central Ban seems certain to cut interest rate next week, both the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are expected to delay their first cuts until the autumn.

        "title": "Packaging firm calls for tighter UK rules on plastics to drive green economy",
        "content": "Whoever wins the UK general election must tighten regulations to reduce the use of plastic packaging, match global standards and drive “green consumption”, the boss of one of the sector’s biggest manufacturers has urged. Miles Roberts, the chief executive of the packaging firm DS Smith, made the call to the next government as the company celebrated passing its target to replace more than 1bn pieces of plastic 16 months early. The FTSE 100 company works with dozens of international firms including Coca-Cola and Tesco to come up with alternatives to plastic tubs, pots and boxes. DS Smith said clever design by its team of more than 700 experts working in partnership with leading food, drink and cleaning product makers had led to the removal of 1.2bn pieces of plastic from its products, including 274m in the UK, which it said led the field. Roberts said EU regulations had been vital in “really supporting the much greater use of material” that was recycled and recyclable. He said: “It is important to note that if our customers – the biggest [grocery] brands – are to remove plastics at scale and at pace, they need the right regulatory framework around them. What we need are stronger, harmonised, global regulations that level the playing field, to help businesses move away from plastic. “If a new government wants more of a green economy then recyclability is part of that. It is not enough to have a few windmills in the sea – not just green energy, but green consumption and clearing up our messes.” DS Smith has cut down plastic by helping companies switch to cardboard-based punnets for fruit and vegetables and replacing plastic wrap around multibottle drinks packs, for example The company last month agreed to be taken over by a bigger US rival, International Paper, in a £5.8bn all-share deal. However, a question mark over the plan emerged last week after Suzano, which is the world’s biggest pulp producer and Latin America’s largest paper manufacturer, said it intended to buy International Paper in a deal conditional on the DS Smith bid being dropped. Roberts said more change was needed in the packaging market or the UK would fall behind its neighbours, with recycling rates in England getting worse, not better. He called for a revival of UK plans to charge packaging users for the reprocessing of waste and to simplify recycling by local authorities. There are more than 100 different systems operated by councils but consistently separating out key reusable waste such as glass or card would mean reprocessors would have a more reliable source of materials and invest in new plants. “I would like to see a clearer regulatory framework if we are going to deal with these challenges,” Roberts said. “Why not use systems that are already working in other countries?” This month the UK government confirmed plans to simplify and standardise recycling practices across England, echoing rules already in place in Scotland and Wales. It has held back from forcing local authorities to separately collect glass, metal, plastic, paper and card – as desired by many recycling businesses – saying these can be collected in one “dry waste” box while food waste and garden waste must be collected separately. The rules will apply from 31 March next year but some authorities have been given leeway on certain aspects until as late as 2043. That comes after Rishi Sunak bragged of having scrapped a proposal to “force you to have seven different bins in your home” even though such a move was not really on the cards. The government has also promised UK-wide extended producer responsibility and deposit return schemes, under which producers will pay about £1.2bn in annual fees to help authorities collect and manage packaging waste. They will also have to indicate on a label if packaging is recyclable. However, the EPR scheme is not due to start until next year, after being postponed by a year. Bottle deposit return schemes have also been delayed across the UK until 2027.",

        "title": "Starbucks resumes bargaining amid fresh wave of unionized stores",
        "content": "Starbucks has resumed bargaining with union leaders amid a fresh wave of organized stores after the world’s largest coffee chain agreed to open talks over labor agreements. After a long, embittered campaign, the Seattle-based coffee giant jointly announced a new framework with Workers United in February to reach contracts with unionized stores. Bargaining got under way on Wednesday, and is due to continue on Thursday. Since baristas in Buffalo successfully formed the first unionized US Starbucks store in December 2021, an organizing drive by Starbucks Workers United has spreadnationwide, to more than 425 Starbucks stores in 43 states, representing over 10,500 workers. That extraordinary growth came in spite of strong opposition from Starbucks managers, who retained union avoidance law firm Littler Mendelson to representthe firm as hundreds of unfair labor practice charges were filed with the National Labor Relations Board by workers, alleging retaliation, intimidation and harassment. Starbucks has consistently denied violating labor laws. But the sheer volume of charges, rulings against them by administrative law judges and the labor board, and accounts from workers themselves detailing their experiences, has bolstered its reputation as an aggressive union buster. As the union campaign showed no signs of dissipating, February’s framework announcement was hailed as a victory by the union, and prompted a wave of Starbucks stores filing for union elections, where workers were no longer subjected to managers and corporate urging them to vote against unionizing. “It was also a lesson that you can’t rely on the law alone,” said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of Labor Education Research at Cornell’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations. “All the unfair labor practices that were filed … the fact is that Starbucks came to the table because the union did a comprehensive campaign, talked to investors, held red-cup days and did much more than just file unfair labor practices.” According to unionelections.org, Starbucks stores have seen the large influx of union election filings since early 2022, when the organizing campaign initially spread after that first union win in Buffalo, reaching 200 unionized stores by summer 2022, and 300 stores by May last year. On 11 March, the campaign reached its 400th unionized store with a win in Miami. The number of Starbucks stores has now climbed to 438 stores and counting, with nine stores voting to unionize the week of 13 May alone. Silas Sterling has worked as a barista for over a year at a Starbucks store in Santa Clarita, California, one of several stores that voted to unionize this month. The new framework “made me really happy to see,” they said. “The whole point of the union is to make positive changes within the company, so I think the company deciding to work together with the union is a great sign of progress.” Sterling cited fair scheduling and improved staffing as key sticking points for them and their co-workers in a first union contract with Starbucks – and expressed hope that “positive changes” are on the way. A total of 430 Starbucks workers representing unionized stores are participating in this week’sbargaining sessions, and want to reach agreements on wages, scheduling, staffing, health and safety issues, and improving access to healthcare for workers. A spokesperson for Starbucks said: “Starbucks and Workers United remain committed to building a positive, productive relationship. We respect our partners’ rights to organize and on progressing negotiations towards ratified store contracts this year.” The chain anticipates making “further progress on the framework intended to be the foundation of each single-store contract,” the spokesperson added. Rachel Williams, a barista for six years in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was skeptical initially after Starbucks made the joint announcement with the union about the new framework. She is now is “cautiously optimistic” thanks to progress made in bargaining sessions so far. Williams and her coworkers unionized earlier this year. After losing shift lead supervisors in their store, they had still been expected to do the same work without them. “Us workers, the baristas, the shift supervisors, we are Starbucks. Starbucks calls us partners, so treat us like partners,” said Williams. “We believe in Starbucks. We love our jobs. We love coming to work. We’re grateful for the benefits Starbucks has given us, and the reason why we’re doing this is because we love our jobs.”",

        "title": "Dr Martens will cut up to £25m in costs to counter weak US sales",
        "content": "Dr Martens has not ruled out job cuts after revealing plans to slash up to £25m worth of costs to help counter weak US sales. The British footwear brand said its latest cost-cutting programme would aim to save £20m to £25m by streamlining its operations and securing better supply contracts. Bosses will also increase “organisational efficiency”, signalling that the company may consider job cuts across its 3,600-strong global workforce. Kenny Wilson, the chief executive of the bootmaker, said it was possible the cost-efficiency plan would result in job losses for its staff, who are spread across the world, including in the UK, Japan, Italy, Germany and the US. Firm plans have not been confirmed, with executives expected to outline further details in November. Meanwhile, Dr Martens, famed for its yellow stitching, revealed that it was halving its dividend payment to shareholders after profits tumbled 43% to £97m in the 12 months to March, with revenues down 12.3% over the year. While sales of sandals and shoes rose by a fifth, sales of boots – which account for at least two-thirds of takings – sank, led by poor trading in the US. Wilson, who is to step down next spring, said many other boot brands had experienced a fall in sales in the US but added that Dr Martens had made mistakes and would be spending more on marketing its footwear in the months ahead. “The US consumer market is tough,” he said. Prices would not go up this year, after two years of inflation, as supply chain cost rises were now “under control”, said Wilson. He said the results were as expected and reflected “continued weak USA consumer demand”, which affected the company’s wholesale and consumer business. However, Dr Martens, which has issued a string of profit warnings in recent years, made clear there was more pain to come, with group revenue expected to drop by 20% between April and September. “We are clear that we need to drive demand in the USA to return to growth” from the 2026 financial year, Wilson said. “And [we] are executing a detailed plan to achieve this, with refocused and increased USA marketing investment in the year ahead. “I am confident that the actions we are taking as we enter this year of transition will put us in good shape for the years ahead.” The boot brand has a wide fanbase and storied history, having originally been created in 1945 by a young German army doctor, Klaus Märtens, who designed an air-cushioned sole to help his recovery from a broken foot. They were later introduced to the UK in 1960, with their sturdy design gaining popularity among postal delivery workers and factory staff before being embraced by skinheads and punks.",

        "title": "‘Fleecing the man off the street’: Car dealers investigated over high interest rates",
        "content": "When Gary Hill took out a £12,500 loan to pay for a new family vehicle in late 2014, he had no idea that the north London dealership he had travelled to from his home in Bedfordshire could have sway over his monthly payments. But the 45-year-old was in a bind, having started a new job that no longer gave him access to a company car. Hill agreed to pay £335 a month over more than five years to take home a Nissan Qashqai, piling costs on to a household budget already supporting three children and the up-keep of his family home. At the time, lenders gave car dealerships and brokers the power to set interest rates on car loans, and earn higher commission as that number grew. The practice – known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) – was eventually banned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 2021, amid concerns it was incentivising dealers and brokers to charge higher interest rates. But a recent influx of complaints – with nearly 10,000 referred to the Financial Ombudsman as of December 2023 – led the regulator to launch an investigation in January to see whether the historic practice resulted in customers like Hill paying more than they ought to. The FCA will decide whether to take any further action, which could include launching a customer compensation scheme funded by the lenders that sat behind the arrangement, in late September. “It is a bit galling to think that individuals feel as if they can fleece the man off the street,” said Hill. He is now among millions of borrowers filing claims against their lenders to see if they are eligible for a slice of a compensation bill that the consumer champion, Martin Lewis, says could be the largest since the infamous PPI scandal, which cost banks over £50bn. Hill’s lender MotoNovo, the car financing arm of specialist lender Aldermore Bank, which provided the loan that he agreed to at the dealership, said they would not comment on specific customers but added: “We’re working collaboratively with the FCA on any investigations they undertake. We won’t be commenting further at this stage whilst the FCA’s review is still in progress.” The FCA in April warned car lenders to hold back cash for potential payouts, which some analysts believe could collectively cost the industry £8bn-£13bn. That could impact big banks and specialist lenders alike. Lloyds Banking Group – which is the most exposed among UK high street banks – has already put aside £450m for potential fines, while Close Brothers has scrapped its dividend and announced plans to strengthen its balance sheet by £400m. Ford’s financing arm, FCE Bank, said in its latest financial filings that there was a “reasonable possible risk of economic outflow related to customer claims” but that it was too early to make provisions. Fears over a hefty bill have spurred industry lobby groups such as the Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), which represents car lenders ranging from big high street banks such as Barclays to the finance arms of manufacturers such as Ford and Volkswagen, into action. And their efforts have not gone unnoticed. In early May, the FCA’s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, told MPs on the parliamentary Treasury select committee that “the trade associations representing banks and motor finance companies are making very strong representations to us and I’m aware they’re making presentations to this committee as well and, likewise, consumer groups.” The FLA’s key warning: UK borrowers will suffer if firms are forced to pay out. “The higher the bill, the higher the interest rate will be for the customer, and then fewer customers will get access to finance for their vehicle,” the FLA’s director of motor finance, Adrian Dally, said. “That’s how it works. And it’s really simple as that.” However, whether that is a credible threat remains to be seen, according to Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com. “I don’t remember any form of mis-selling or reclaim campaign – and I have been involved in many – where the industry hasn’t always argued, ‘well, it’s gonna cause problems and make it more difficult in the future because we’ll be making less profit’. That’s just the obvious step in the dance.” But motor lenders – which lent £16.9bn to UK car owners last year – argue DCAs also allowed dealerships to charge lower interest to customers at times when they needed to clinch a sale. The FLA fears that the regulator could ultimately side with the Financial Ombudsman Service, which the lobby group has accused of being “overzealous” in its interpretation of responsible lending rules. They are concerned about two cases which the Financial Ombudsman upheld earlier this year against Lloyds and Barclays, which caused the FCA investigation. In those cases, the ombudsman found the lenders would have accepted much lower rates than those set by the dealership, meaning there may have been a conflict of interest that potentially harmed consumers. But Dally argues consumer harm should be balanced against a host of other factors, including potential disruption to the industry. “Seven million households have a motor finance agreement,” he said. “And market integrity, which is a statutory obligation for FCA, means that the UK needs those 7m households to continue having access to motor finance after this work – and at a good price.” He also noted there could be ripple effects for the “willingness of international manufacturers to supply cars to the UK”. While the FCA does not directly regulate carmakers, there are questions about how this could affect the UK’s relationships with foreign car manufacturers already feeling burned by Brexit. Foreign investors have already been raising concerns about the FCA investigation with firms that have no exposure to the motor finance industry, according to one senior banker. Those investors are concerned that lawful behaviour by firms they decide to back today could end up costing billions in fines in the future. All of that is to say that the car financing review could prove to be one of the first significant tests of the FCA’s so-called secondary objective, which since last summer forces City regulators to consider how their decisions impact international competitiveness and UK economic growth. Lewis said it had put the FCA in a “very interesting position”. “I certainly think there is a potential battle within the FCA between, let’s say, the consumer championing elements and maybe the competitiveness elements. And it would not surprise me that that is something that is yet to play out. And we will see where it goes,” Lewis said. Where the FLA and Lewis do agree is that a swift resolution is key, given the flood of complaints hitting lenders, including from notorious claims management companies, which offer free services upfront but can charge up to 25% of any successful claim. An FCA spokesperson said: “In deciding next steps, we will be informed by our primary statutory objectives to protect consumers, ensure market integrity and promote competition in the interests of consumers. “If we find there has been widespread misconduct we will identify how best to make sure people who are owed compensation receive an appropriate settlement in an orderly, consistent and efficient way.” The Treasury declined to comment.",

        "title": "ExxonMobil and Chevron gather investors after latest big oil mega deal",
        "content": "Shareholders in ExxonMobil and Chevron gathered for the big oil giants’ annual meetings on Wednesday amid scrutiny from lawmakers and climate activists. Hours before they convened, another US energy conglomerate, ConocoPhillips, announced plans to buy Marathon Oil in an all-stock deal worth about $17.1bn – rendering it the latest firm to place a vast bet on the future of fossil fuel production. The meetings come as both Exxon and Chevron are under investigation by Democrats for a recent dinner with Donald Trump, where he reportedly made a quid-pro-quo offer to oil bosses. Both Chevron and Exxon have also come under fire for promoting doubt about global warming despite knowledge of its harms, and for reneging on previous climate pledges as gas prices have risen. In October, ExxonMobil agreed to buy the shale group Pioneer Natural Resources, while Chevron announced plans to acquire the Texas oil company Hess – two of the country’s largest oil and gas deals in decades. ExxonMobil completed its acquisition earlier this month, while Chevron is vying to get its deal across the line. Environmental campaigners have condemned these deals, warning that they risk exacerbating the climate crisis by enabling big oil operators to grow even larger despite scientific consensus that fossil fuel must be phased out to avert climate catastrophe. ConocoPhillips’s takeover of Marathon Oil – valued at $22.5bn, when including $5.4bn in debt – comes amid climbing oil prices. Crude prices have jumped more than 12% this year, and the cost of a barrel rose above $80 this week. “As oil and gas companies continue to merge and acquire one another, it raises serious questions about the industry’s commitment to reducing emissions and transitioning to cleaner forms of energy,” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director for the Make Polluters Pay campaign, which focuses on oil industry accountability. “These deals, worth tens of billions of dollars, suggest that major players are still betting heavily on a future dominated by fossil fuels.” While oil giants remain under pressure over their climate impact, Exxon shareholders voted to re-elect the firm’s chair Darren Woods, lead director Joseph Hooley, and all 12 directors to the company’s board. The firm had been grappling with a “vote no” campaign, launched in response to a lawsuit Exxon filed against investors pushing to curb the company’s greenhouse gas emissions. The largest public pension manager in the US, the California Public Employment Retirement System, voted against every board member’s re-election in response to the company’s lawsuit against Arjuna Capital and Follow This, activist investor groups that submitted a shareholder proposal earlier this year to commit Exxon to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. Exxon claims the shareholder proposal seeks to undermine the company’s business. Investors in Chevron also re-elected all 12 of the firm’s board directors, throwing their weight behind the oil major’s leadership. Chevron has faced criticism amid the war in Gaza for extracting gas claimed by Israel in the eastern Mediterranean. As its shareholders gathered in the Bay Area on Wednesday morning, dozens of protesters blockaded the entrance to the oil company’s headquarters to call for it to divest from operations in Israel and for consumers to boycott the company. “Chevron is literally fueling the genocide being waged against Palestinians,” said Matt Leonard of the Oil and Gas Action Network. Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips chair and CEO, declared that its deal for Marathon Oil would add “high-quality, low cost of supply inventory” to the firm’s operations. “Importantly”, he added, ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil “share similar values and cultures with a focus on operating safely and responsibly to create long-term value for our shareholders”. Lee Tillman, Marathon Oil chair, president and CEO, hailed a “proud moment” for his company, which he claimed had remained “true to our core values of safety and environmental excellence” while generating “compelling” returns for its shareholders. The deal, which requires approval from Marathon Oil stockholders and clearance by regulators, is expected to close in the fourth quarter. The recently approved Exxon-Pioneer merger has also faced FTC scrutiny after the regulatory body claimed that Pioneer’s former CEO Scott Sheffield had attempted to privately coordinate with Opec+ officials to keep fuel prices high.

        "title": "What will Royal Mail’s takeover mean for customers and postal workers?",
        "content": "The billionaire sometimes known as the Czech Sphinx appears to be on the verge of becoming the first person to buy the Royal Mail in its 500-year history. The board of the British postal service’s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), has agreed to a £3.57bn takeover bid from Daniel Křetínský, meaning the deal has a strong chance of going through. A sale would mark a milestone in the history of a business that was privatised just over a decade ago but that can trace its history back to Henry VIII’s Masters of the Post. So what will a takeover mean for customers and posties and what can we expect from the Czech Sphinx? Who is Daniel Křetínský? Křetínský is a law graduate from the city of Brno who has risen to become one of the richest people in the Czech Republic. He has investments across Europe, spanning industries including energy, media, retail and sport, all housed within his holding company EP Group. His soubriquet derives from his supposedly inscrutable approach to business. In 2020, he turned his attention to the UK with his investment vehicle Vesa, a subsidiary of EP Group, amassing a 3% stake in the supermarket chain J Sainsbury. By the end of the same year, Vesa had also become the largest investor in the high street trainer chain Foot Locker and had begun building its stake in Royal Mail. The following year, he and his business partners bought 27% of West Ham United Football Club, sparking great excitement among fans about the impact his riches might have on the fortunes of the mid-table east London club. By 2022, Křetínský had built up a stake of 27.5% in Royal Mail through Vesa. He now proposes to take the business private, becoming the first private individual to hold the reins of Britain’s postal service. Why does he want it? The answer isn’t obvious, given that EP Group has itself lamented the Royal Mail’s “weak financial performance, poor service delivery and slow transformation”. Křetínský clearly believes he can provide the investment required to modernise the company and restore it to profitability. He says Royal Mail can become one of the largest logistics companies in Europe but “must accelerate its transformation and investments into modernisation to keep up with the competition”. Key to future profitability is something called the universal service obligation, which requires the postal service to fulfil certain obligations by act of parliament. The company has asked the government and the media regulator Ofcom to allow it to water down the requirements, including scrapping daily letter deliveries. The postal union, the Communication Workers Union (CWU), has recently softened its opposition to this plan, indicating that Royal Mail could soon get the green light for savings of £300m. What’s the government’s role? IDS shareholders have to approve the deal but that’s unlikely to be a problem given that the board has recommended it and Vesa already owns more than a quarter of the company. However, the takeover could be scrutinised and even blocked under the National Security and Investment Act 2021, given that the postal service is a significant piece of British infrastructure. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has indicated that state opposition is unlikely. Labour has said it welcomes the assurances given by Křetínský and would ensure they were adhered to if it wins the general election. But in theory, the government could “call in” the takeover for scrutiny and prevent it, if it is deemed to be against the UK’s national security interests. The Czech Sphinx hopes to solve that riddle by issuing a series of undertakings and commitments, some demanded by IDS as a condition of accepting the offer, in the hope of securing the blessing of the British government. But they all have time limits. What promises has Křetínský made? For five years after any deal completes, Royal Mail must abide by a series of conditions. These include that the company continues as the UK’s universal service provider, with whatever requirements the government and Ofcom lay down after considering proposed changes to the obligation. The list of legally binding undertakings includes a promise that the Royal Mail brand will be retained, including the royal “cypher”, the monogram you see on the side of post boxes. IDS and the Royal Mail will retain their UK headquarters and tax residency and must also continue to recognise their trade unions, the CWU and Unite. The company must not transfer any cash to the parent company unless its debt is below a certain level and it also cannot use any surplus from the pension scheme to reward shareholders. IDS has also secured contractual pledges including that EP supports the postal company’s existing proposals for the universal service and does not put forward any alternative plan. EP has promised that it won’t cut salaries and bonuses for a minimum of two years and will support Royal Mail’s planned new pension scheme for the same period. What happens after the period ends? EP Group can do what it likes after the periods covering its promises come to an end. In theory it could try to end its recognition of the postal worker unions, scrap the royal cypher, or even do something as insane as changing the company’s name to Consignia. Any potential snags? Debt could be an issue. Royal Mail has £1.7bn of existing debts. To buy out the remaining shareholders for £3.57bn, Křetínský will borrow another £2.3bn, meaning the group’s overall debt will increase. Sources close to the company say any extra leverage will stop short of affecting the company’s investment rating. EP Group will also have to manage its relationship with the CWU carefully. Royal Mail workers staged a series of strikes throughout 2022 and 2023. Negotiations will be key to the company’s future performance. If Křetínský’s plans spell bad news for posties and their jobs, that could make for new hostilities.",

        "title": "BHP walks away from £39bn pursuit of Anglo American; Royal Mail agrees to £3.57bn takeover by Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up, after a dramatic day of takeover drama in the City which saw a massive mining merger bid collapse, but a firm offer for the UK’s Royal Mail. Here’s a recap: The takeover of Royal Mail by the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský has edged closer after its owner agreed terms and conditions on a £3.57bn offer. In an update to the market on Wednesday, the postal service’s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), said it had accepted a cash offer from Křetínský’s EP Group. The deal means Křetínský, who made his fortune in energy and owns a minority stake in one of the main gas pipelines from Russia into Europe, would pay 360p a share for the 73% of the struggling postal service he does not already own, plus 10p in dividends. BHP Group has walked away from its pursuit of Anglo American, after failing to win support from its rival miner for a £39bn takeover proposal. BHP abandoned its attempt to take control of Anglo, just before a ‘put up or shut up’ deadline, and said it was disappointed. Mike Henry, BHP’s chief executive officer, told the City: While we believed that our proposal for Anglo American was a compelling opportunity to effectively grow the pie of value for both sets of shareholders, we were unable to reach agreement with Anglo American on our specific views in respect of South African regulatory risk and cost and, despite seeking to engage constructively and numerous requests, we were not able to access from Anglo American key information required to formulate measures to address the excess risk they perceive. The Guardian has shown how some of the most powerful ticket touts in the UK have discussed a secret plan to try to scupper a Labour crackdown on the industry via a lobbying campaign. Labour voters now make up the majority of customers at all leading supermarkets apart from Waitrose, according to the latest polling from retail research firm GlobalData. Rishi Sunak’s election pledge to introduce mandatory national service would leave the UK’s poorest regions millions of pounds worse off, a thinktank has warned. Orange juice makers are considering turning to alternative fruits such as mandarins as wholesale prices have “gone bananas” amid fears of poor harvests in Brazil. Ofwat, the water regulator for England and Wales, is understood to be considering cutting fines for sewage-dumping water companies if they are facing financial pressures. Reuters’ Prague bureau have caught up with the man of the moment, Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský, to discuss his takeover bid for Royal Mail’s parent company IDS. Křetínský told Reuters that IDS must focus on not losing market share – something that would be “fatal” in the UK. Here’s the story: Royal Mail and GLS need sizable, almost immediate investments to defend market share and face shifting market trends, Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky told Reuters on Wednesday after the groups’ owner agreed to a £3.57bn pound takeover. “It is important for logistics companies not to miss this out-of-home delivery wave, which means they need to be ready to invest now,” Kretinsky said. “We believe that if the group doesn’t respond properly on the out of the home solutions it may have a detrimental impact on its market share. And specifically in the UK, any shrinkage of the market share would be fatal.” Anglo American has responded to BHP’s decision to walk away rather than make a firm offer by 5pm today. Stuart Chambers, chairman of Anglo American, says the company is “fully focused” on the break-up plan it announced earlier this week. Chambers tells the City: “Anglo American has set out a clear pathway to accelerate delivery of its strategy and to unlock significant value for its shareholders. Our shareholders will benefit from value transparency and undiluted exposure to a simpler portfolio of world class assets, consistently stronger operational performance, and highly attractive growth in copper, premium iron ore and crop nutrients. Anglo American’s management team, supported by the Board, is fully focused on delivering the plans it has set out to accelerate value delivery, and doing so at pace. “I thank Anglo American’s shareholders and stakeholders for their constructive dialogue throughout this period, and our employees for their resilience and commitment. We look forward to delivering our plans for the benefit of our shareholders and for stakeholders, both in our host countries and more broadly.” Other suiters could now try their chances at wooing Anglo American, suggests Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. The attraction, he points out, is Anglo’s copper mines. Coatsworth says: “In effect, BHP has done all the hard work in sounding out whether Anglo American was willing to be bought and in what way it might accept a bid. BHP has fired the starting gun for others to throw their hat into the ring and it seems almost certain that another player could bid for Anglo American in the near future. “Buying Anglo American would provide a ready-made spread of copper assets which are of increasing importance to the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Copper is used in wind farms, electric vehicles and so many other ‘new era’ energy devices. Miners are hungry for more and it is much easier to buy another company that is already sitting on proven resources than spend years on exploration. “All eyes are now on Glencore and Rio Tinto to see if they fancy their chances at buying Anglo American.” Shares in Royal Mail’s parent company, IDS, closed 4.3% higher tonight at 335p. That’s their highest closing level in over two years. But, it’s also below the 370p offer which IDS’s board accepted today, suggesting uncertainty that the deal -- which must get past regulatory and political scrutiny – will happen…. At the close of trading in London, Anglo’s shares are down 3% today at £24.95. They were trading around £21 before BHP made its first move in April – so shareholders are still in profit. BHP’s interest also prompted Anglo to draw up plans to break itself up, including selling its famous diamond business De Beers as part of a historic corporate overhaul. Having said it does not intend to bid for Anglo American, BHP cannot make a new approach for six months, under City takeover rules. There are some ways, though, that the six-month cooling off period can be waived. For example, Anglo’s board could agree to it, or another company could make an offer for Anglo, or the Takeover panel could agree there’s been “a material change of circumstances”. BHP also tells the City it is “disappointed” that the board of Anglo American has decided not to continue discussions to resolve concerns regarding the implementation of its revised proposal. It says: BHP had been engaging with Anglo American on these topics since the submission of its revised proposal on 20 May and believes that there was a viable pathway available to resolve Anglo American’s concerns. In particular, Anglo American’s assertion that value risk under our proposal would be exclusively for the account of Anglo American shareholders is not accurate. As covered earlier, Anglo insisted this morning that BHP’s proposal was “highly complex” – as it involved Anglo spinning off its South Africa-based Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore operations. Shares in Anglo American have dropped by almost 4%, following BHP Group’s decision not to make a firm offer. They’ve dropped to around £24.58, down from £25.58 last night. BHP’s final proposal, which valued Anglo at almost £39bn, had been worth £29.34 per share. NEWSFLASH: BHP Group has walked away from its pursuit of Anglo American. BHP, which had proposed paying almost £39bn for Anglo American, has given up after failing to persuade its rival miner to accept a takeover offer or extend talks. The announcement comes about 45 minutes before the deadline to either put up a firm offer or walk away, and also comes hours after Anglo rejected BHP’s request for more time to hammer out an agreement. Mike Henry, BHP’s chief executive officer, says: “BHP will not be making a firm offer for Anglo American. BHP is committed to its Capital Allocation Framework and maintains a disciplined approach to mergers and acquisitions. While we believed that our proposal for Anglo American was a compelling opportunity to effectively grow the pie of value for both sets of shareholders, we were unable to reach agreement with Anglo American on our specific views in respect of South African regulatory risk and cost and, despite seeking to engage constructively and numerous requests, we were not able to access from Anglo American key information required to formulate measures to address the excess risk they perceive We remain of the view that our proposal was the most effective structure to deliver value for Anglo American shareholders, and we are confident that, working together with Anglo American, we could have obtained all required regulatory approvals, including in South Africa.” Exciting news in the music industry… Sony Music is in talks to acquire Queen’s music catalog, Bloomberg reports. The deal, to buy hits such as Bohemian Rhapsody, in what could be one of the biggest ever deals of its kind, says Bloomberg. Here’s a flavour of the story: Sony is working with another investor on a purchase that could potentially total $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named discussing confidential information. The talks, which also cover merchandising and other business opportunities, are ongoing and may not result in an agreement, according to the people. A spokesperson for Sony declined to comment. A representative for Queen could not be reached for comment. Just in: Marks &amp; Spencer has turned to property portal Rightmove for its new CFO. M&amp;S has told the City that Alison Dolan will join its board as Chief Financial Officer. She will take over from interim CFO Jeremy Townsend who will remain in post until May 2025. Stuart Machin, M&amp;S’s chief executive officer, says: “I am delighted to welcome Alison to M&amp;S as our Chief Financial Officer. We are fortunate to attract somebody of Alison’s calibre who will be a fantastic addition to the leadership team and with so much experience in fast paced, digitally led businesses, will help us in this next phase of transforming M&amp;S.” Dolan is currently CFO of Rightmove, who have told shareholders that she has a twelve month notice period and “a date for her departure will be agreed”. The global unemployment rate is expected to fall slightly this year. The International Labour Organization (ILO) forecast today that the worldwide jobless rate will dip to 4.9% this year from 5.0% in 2023, better than the 5.2% they forecast in January The revision is mainly due to lower-than-expected unemployment rates in China, India, and high-income countries reported so far this year, the ILO said. However, the ILO also warns that inequalities in labour markets remain, with a “persistent” lack of employment opportunities. The election is the least interesting development in the UK right now. That’s the verdict of City firm TS Lombard today. They point out that there isn’t a lot of election uncertainty to excite the markets, with Labour set to gain the largest share of votes, adding: The rumour mill over why the Conservatives called an early election has been turning, with some speculating the party wanted to avoid much worse data coming out this autumn or some other ominous event. But the election could be seen as a positive because it reduces the economic uncertainty that might otherwise have persisted into the third quarter over which party will lead the government. What is more likely, though, is that it will prove a non-event; market pricing seems to reflect this outcome. And indeed, the latest poll from YouGov shows Labour with a 27-point lead, at 47% support, ahead of the Conservatives with 20%. Anxiety that US interest rates may not be cut as swiftly as hoped is weighing on Wall Street today. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 316 points, or 0.8%, in early trading to 38,536 points. That adds to yesterday’s losses, taking the Dow further from its record high over 40,000 points set this month. The Russell 2000 index of small companies is down 1.3%, at a three-week low. John Wood Group says it is evaluating the final takeover proposal made by rival Sidara today (see 2.21pm) and will make a further announcement in due course…. More takeover news: British oil services company John Wood Group has received a fourth and final takeover offer from Dubai-based rival Sidara. Sidara says its new offer, of 230p per share, is a 52% premium to John Wood’s share price at the end of April, before its first offer. By my maths, it values John Wood at £1.58bn, up from an earlier rejected £1.4bn offer. Sidara says John Wood has not engaged with it, since the initial approach, adding: Sidara does not believe that its proposal can be progressed unless the Board of Wood engages with Sidara and an extension to the deadline is granted. Under the Takeover Code Sidara has until 5 June 2024 either to announce a firm intention to make an offer for Wood or to announce it has no intention to make an offer. Despite the jump in International Distribution Services’s share price today, the London market is sliding again. IDS are now up 4% at 334p, moving close to Daniel Křetínský’s offer of 370p/share. That makes IDS the second-biggest rise on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies listed in London, which is down 0.85% today. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is in the red too, down 0.5%, and on track for its sixth fall in a row. Grocery technology firm Ocado are the top faller, down 5%, putting it on track to be ejected into the FTSE 250 when the indices are next reshuffled. Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index, explains: “The FTSE is falling, adding to losses from the previous session, as the UK index continues to retreat from its all-time high earlier this month. Stronger-than-expected US data and hawkish Fed comments have hurt risk sentiment across the markets. News that the IMF has upwardly revised China’s growth forecast to 5% after a solid first quarter and recent supportive policy measures from Beijing have helped oil majors higher but have failed to boost the miners. Anglo-American is trading down 1.5% ahead of a key deadline today for a takeover deal with BHP. The jump in German inflation this month (see earlier post) illustrates the stickiness of inflation in the entire eurozone, says Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. Brzeski told clients: Today’s German inflation data not only illustrates the ongoing impact of base effects and earlier government measures on present inflation but also stresses how sticky inflation remains. That stickiness looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects are petering out while, at the same time, the economy is gaining traction and wages are increasing. However, it probably won’t stop the European Central Bank cutting interest rates next week. he adds: Today’s increase in German headline inflation is a good reminder of how difficult the last mile of bringing inflation sustainably back to 2% will be for the European Central Bank. Still, with an entire choir of ECB Governing Council members once again singing about rate cuts, anything other than a cut of 25bp next week would be a major surprise, not to mention a severe reputational loss for the central bank. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said it he is “encouraged” by what he has seen about the takeover of Royal Mail’s parent company by EP Group. Speaking to reporters today, Starmer said: “I’m glad that some progress seems to be being made on Royal Mail and I hope further progress can be made so that Royal Mail can be safeguarded with a secure future. “I’m encouraged by what has been said so far about job security and the approach that we’ve taken. Obviously it’s early days, but I do think this is a step in the right direction.” In the media world, London’s Evening Standard has announced plans to shut its daily newspaper and replace it with a new weekly publication. The newspaper has been hit hard by the introduction of phone signal on the London underground, a shortage of commuters owing to the growth of working from home and changing consumer habits, my colleague Jim Waterson reports. More here: Newsflash: Inflation in Germany has picked up this month. Statistics body Destatis reports that Germany’s annual inflation rate is estimated to have risen to 2.4% for May, up from 2.2% in April. On an EU-harmonised basis, inflation rose to 2.8% from 2.4%. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was unchanged at 3%. Good news for UK holidaymakers heading across the Channel this summer – the pound has reached a near two-year high against the euro today. Sterling hit €1.1785 this morning, meaning one euro was worth 84.8p. That’s the pound’s strongest level since August 2022, before the mini-budget crisis sent it reeling against rival currencies. The euro is weaker, as traders expect the European Central Bank to cut interest rates next week, while the Bank of England may not lower rates until November, according to the money markets today. This chart shows how Royal Mail/IDS’s share price has fluctuated since it was floated in 2013. As we blogged at the time, Royal Mail’s shares surged 38% on the first day’s trading, in October 2013, leading to claims the government had sold it too cheaply. Members of the public who took part in the 2013 Royal Mail flotation will also make a profit. There was a big rush to take part, meaning people were allocated 227 shares each, worth £749. At Křetínský’s 370p offer, those shares (bought for 330p each) are worth £840, meaning those who held onto them will make a paper profit of about £90. They’ll also have received dividends over the years. However, they’d have made a bigger killing if they’d sold straight away, as Royal Mail shares soared to around £5.80 in the weeks after the float. UPDATED: Křetínský’s takeover offer for Royal Mail should deliver a windfall to postal staff who received shares though its flotation over a decade ago. When the government floated Royal Mail on the stock market in 2013, it awarded 10% of its shares to its staff, with 150,000 employees sharing 100m shares. Most staff received 913 shares each. If Křetínský offer’s goes through, those stakes would be worth around £3,380 each. However, at Royal Mail’s alltime share price high above £6, those stakes were worth around £5,500. Here’s our news story on Ofwat’s plans: Shares in UK water companies are rallying today, following reports that Ofwat is planning a more lenient regulatory regime for poorly performing firms. United Utilities, which operates in North West England (where it recently pumped raw sewage into Windermere for hours) are up 2.8%. Severn Trent have gained 1.5%, while Pennon Group (owner of South West Water, hit by the waterborne disease outbreak in Devon) are up 2.1%. Greenpeace fears Ofwat is rewarding failure. Dr Doug Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: “If the story is correct the regulator has decided to reward failure, and punish the water companies for devaluing the UK’s water supply by giving them less stringent targets, a holiday on regulatory enforcement and more shareholder dividends. Thames Water have got exactly what they were asking for - because it seems that in order to encourage other foreign investors to degrade UK infrastructure and turn our rivers into open sewers, they need to get a reasonable rate of return.” Newsflash: Anglo American has rejected this morning’s request from rival miner BHP Billiton for an extension for the deadline to make a takeover offer. Anglo tells the City that it has held “extensive engagement with BHP and its advisers”, having rejected BHP’s three takeover proposals so far. And it remains unimpressed by BHP’s proposal, saying: The BHP Proposal includes the same highly complex and unattractive structure as the proposals previously rejected on 26 April 2024 and 13 May 2024. Anglo cites BHP’s demand that it spins off its stakes in its South African platinum and iron ore units, before a deal is done, saying: The requirement to pursue two contemporaneous demergers of publicly listed companies alongside a takeover and the inter-conditional nature of the three transactions is unprecedented. Undertaking a takeover in parallel with two demergers would result in additional material approvals. Anglo is also unimpressed by the “socioeconomic measures” proposed by BHP to smooth the deal, saying they would still leave its shareholders carrying most of the risk from the deal: As Anglo puts it: On 28 May 2024, BHP put forward a limited number of socioeconomic measures that were confined in scope, impact and duration and that BHP stated would support regulatory approvals. This approach does not sufficiently address the fact that Anglo American’s shareholders would bear disproportionate execution and value risks and uncertainty over an extended period, nor does it consider that material conditions would likely be imposed in relation to both Anglo American Platinum and Kumba which would require the approvals of their respective boards. This means BHP has until 5.00 pm today to either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Anglo American, or walk away for six months….. Postal unions are pushing for a new ownership model for Royal Mail, in which both staff and customers would have “a direct say” in how the company is run. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, is also calling for a ‘golden share’ to be created (which would give special powers to block certain decisions). Ward says: “We do welcome some of the commitments that have been made but the reality is postal workers across the UK have lost all faith in the senior management of Royal Mail and the service has been deliberately run down. “We will meet with EP Group next week and call for a complete reset in employee and industrial relations, the restoration of postal services and further commitments on the future of the company. “We will also be directly engaging with the Labour Party and other stakeholders to call for a new model of ownership for Royal Mail where our members and customers have a direct say in key decisions and the creation of a golden share which will protect a key part of the UK’s communications infrastructure.” Ward also told Radio 4’s Today Programme that the CWU was seeking more extensive assurances about the future of postal services, and pension guarantees, as you can hear: Another takeover battle could be going into extra time. BHP Group, the mining giant, has told the City it believes a further extension of the deadline for it to bid for rival Anglo American is needed, so there can be further engagement on its proposal. BHP says it has proposed a number of “socioeconomic measures” to address Anglo American’s concerns about its proposal, which has been consistently rejected by Anglo. BHP, which has until 5pm to bid or walk away, says its proposed measures would provide greater economic benefits to South Africa than the break-up plan announced by Anglo American this month. These measure include a series of steps aimed at addressing concerns over BHP’s condition that Anglo divest some South African assets – its shareholdings in Anglo Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore – before BHP’s proposal, currently valued at £34bn, can go ahead. The company says: BHP believes that its proposal will contribute to South Africa and allow the benefits of South African mining to be shared with more South African stakeholders. There is still ‘some caution’ about whether this deal to acquire Royal Mail’s parent company will go through, says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown: Royal Mail owner IDS has rallied again after news broke that the board has agreed to a formal takeover offer from its major shareholder, EP Group, led by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky. Crucially, the offer is believed to deliver extra commitments to keep the name and the brand, rule out compulsory redundancies and keep the company headquartered in the UK. There is still some caution about whether the deal will go ahead, given that the government has the power under the National Security and investment act to potentially block the deal. IDS comes with a lot of Royal Mail baggage, particularly the obligation to deliver letters six days a week as the UK’s universal postal service, at a time when volumes are in sharp decline. But the group’s international arm GLS has long been considered the jewel in the company’s crown, enjoying a level of success which Royal Mail has found elusive and EP Group will have been eyeing up the long-term opportunities here, particularly if inflation subsides further which should help margin growth. Shares in International Distribution Services have jumped 3% at the start of trading, as traders react to the news that Křetínský’s recommended cash offer for International Distribution Services. That have hit 335.2p, their highest level in over two years. But, that’s still shy of Křetínský’s offer (which is 360p per share in cash, plus a special dividend of 8p, plus a planned final dividend of 2p). That suggests the City aren’t 100% certain that the deal will go through. It requires IDS shareholders to vote for it, and will surely also have to clear a national security review. Křetínský’s EP Group points out that the 370p offer is a 72.7% premium to IDS’s closing share price of 214p on 16 April, the day before his first offer (worth £3bn) was announced. Křetínský already owns 27.5% of IDS. The Labour Party has said it will make sure that Křetínský sticks to his promises regarding Royal Mail, should it win July’s general election. In a statement, Labour welcomes Křetínský’s commitments (see earlier post), saying: “These assurances are welcome that Royal Mail will retain its British identity and safeguard its workforce with no compulsory redundancies. Labour in government will ensure these are adhered to.” What guarantees are there for Royal Mail’s staff? Daniel Křetínský’s EP Group says it will abide by the deal reached between the postal operator and its unions, and will “enter into pay deal discussions with Royal Mail’s unions in good faith.” It also pledges to maintain pay and benefits packages, saying that it has committed, for at least two years, that: base salaries, wage rates and cash/equity incentive opportunities will, at a minimum, be maintained (save for any adjustments to cash/equity incentive opportunities to take into account the de-listing of IDS Shares); and benefits and allowance packages (including pension benefits) will be no less favourable than those in place as at completion of the Acquisition. The board of IDS agreed to Křetínský’s takeover offer after hammering out a package of legally binding undertakings and commitments. They include a list of Undertakings to the UK Government, which include ensuring that Royal Mail remains the Universal Service Provider (USP) for postal services, for five years after the deal is completed. That includes complying with the regulatory conditions imposed by Ofcom on Royal Mail for the next five years – including continuing to provide the “one-price-goes-anywhere” service in the United Kingdom and delivering first class letters six days a week. [However, Ofcom is currently pondering reforms to the universal service obligation, which could include watering down second-class post, or reducing the service to as little as three days a week] Křetínský also pledges that Royal Mail wouldn’t make any return of capital, asset transfers, loans or loan repayments that would raise its net leverage ratio above 2:1, or undermine its ability to operate as the USP – basically a pledge not to asset-strip the company. As flagged earlier, both IDS and Royal Mail would maintain their headquarters in the UK for at least five years and remain tax resident in the UK. The takeover agreement also touches on GLS – IDS’s rather profitable international parcels operation run out of Amsterdam. Křetínský pledges that there will be no change of control for either GLS or Royal Mail for three years. He is also pledging not to dip into any surplus in the Royal Mail pension scheme, and to continue to recognise the CWU and CMA Unite unions. Daniel Křetínský says he knows that owning Royal Mail comes with “enormous responsibility” – both to staff and customers. In a statement released in today’s takeover announcement, Křetínský says: “IDS, and Royal Mail in particular, form part of the national infrastructure of the countries they operate in. More than that, Royal Mail is part of the fabric of UK society and has been for hundreds of years. The EP group has the utmost respect for Royal Mail’s history and tradition, and I know that owning this business will come with enormous responsibility - not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day. The scale of the commitments we are offering to the company and the UK Government reflect how seriously we take this responsibility, to the benefit of IDS’ employees, union representatives and all other stakeholders. Křetínský - known as the ‘Czech Sphinx‘ due to his enigmatic approach to business – also promises to support International Distribution Services to transform its business: The EP group is a patient, supportive investor with a long-term view and decades of experience in owning critical national infrastructure. We are committed investors in the UK and first became a shareholder in IDS four years ago, as we saw the potential for the business to become one of the largest postal logistics groups in Europe. But IDS’ market is evolving quickly, and it must accelerate its transformation and investments into modernisation to keep up with the competition. We will support the business in the next critical phase of its transformation and beyond, providing our experience and financial resilience to support the management team. We look forward to working closely with all of IDS’ stakeholders to deliver against its full potential.“ Britain’s struggling water companies are about to get a hand-up from regulators, according to reports this morning. Water regulator Ofwat is drawing up plans for a special “recovery regime” for Thames Water and other financially stressed UK water companies, the Financial Times reports. Under this regime, the water companies could receive fewer or no regulatory penalties to encourage them to invest in infrastructure improvements instead. They would also be given more “realistic” targets for reducing sewage and water leaks and outages – despite some companies having spectacularly failed to hit targets in the past. One person close to the plan has told the FT that while Ofwat recognises the “moral hazard involved in letting poor performers off the hook, it is also keen to put these companies on an upward trajectory”. News of Ofwat’s planned leniancy comes a day after the Guardian reported that the regulator was poised to refuse most water companies’ requests to ratchet up consumer bills. Some are expected to get as little as half of what they have asked for, in the next review of bills and spending plans. The new special “recovery regime” could be announced within weeks, to avoid Thames Water being taken into the government’s special administration regime, the FT adds. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It’s deadline day in the City today, with suitors for two UK-listed companies – mining giant BHP Billiton and Royal Mail – given until 5pm today to put up a formal bid, or walk away for six months. And in the last few minutes, Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský has announced a recommended cash offer for Royal Mail’s parent company International Distribution Services has been agreed. IDS’s board has agreed to back a takeover worth £3.57bn, or 370p per share. Earlier this month, IDS said it was minded to approve this improved offer from Křetínsy’s EP Group… …and this morning Keith Williams, the chair of IDS, says the offer is”fair and reasonable” given the uncertainties ahead. Williams says various guarantees have been reached with Křetínský, which will be presented to the government as soon as possible. Those guarantees include ensuring that Royal Mail continues as the Universal Service Provider for five years after the deal is concluded, and maintaining a UK headquarters and tax residency for that period too (but what happens after that, you may wonder….). Williams says: The IDS Board has negotiated a far-reaching package of legally binding undertakings and commitments which provide our customers, employees and broader stakeholders with important safeguards. These cover the provision of the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service Obligation (including First Class letters still delivered six days a week), the financial stability and maintenance of the IDS Group including Royal Mail, the maintenance of employee benefits and pensions, and ensuring Royal Mail remains headquartered and tax resident in the UK. The deal could still face hurdles, though – chancellor Jeremy Hunt has indicated that the national security implications of such a bid would need to be scrutinised….

        "title": "Royal Mail’s foreign sale could put a 500-year-old national service in jeopardy | Phillip Inman",
        "content": "There is much to fear from the takeover of Royal Mail by a private financier. It is fair to say that over the longer term, everything about the 500-year-old institution could now be at risk. The string of commitments made by the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský in his bid for the postal service’s parent group, International Distribution Services (IDS) – accepted by the board on Wednesday – will be vulnerable to renegotiation after just a few years. A relationship with 28 million households and more than 5m businesses is at risk. A central question is whether customers will still be able to afford to post a letter. Another is whether those on the periphery of the new owner’s vision – rural dwellers and elderly people – could be excluded to improve the company’s profitability. Křetínský is offering to take IDS private for £3.57bn, absorbing about £1.7bn of existing debt in the process. He says he will pay for the business with £1.2bn in cash and an extra £2.3bn in borrowed funds, meaning Royal Mail will be burdened with even more debt should the deal go through. Indebted businesses that are considered strategic by the UK government, such as Thames Water, can use those borrowings as leverage over ministers and regulators. No minister wants to consider renationalisation when the purchase includes the cost of a large debt pile. Debt is like a poison pill deterring ministers from acting decisively. Then there are the commitments to preserve Royal Mail as an identifiable entity. Křetínský promises the branding is sacred for five years, as are its UK headquarters and tax residency. A separate promise to maintain base salaries and benefits for staff will last for only two years, while a pledge not to break up the company is for three years. In the context of an organisation that traces its roots back to Henry VIII, these are micro-commitments. No doubt ministers will be told that making further demands on Křetínský will scare him off and Royal Mail, left to fend for itself, will not be viable. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, who met Křetínský at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, has turned his back on union calls for renationalisation. Reynolds said the Czech’s assurances that Royal Mail would “retain its British identity and safeguard its workforce” were welcome, indicating he is minded to wave through the takeover should Labour win the election. Look over the Channel to France, and the government funds a universal service to bind society with an institution that, while not beyond criticism, provides a sense of collective welfare, making sure everyone can communicate using paper for official and friendly purposes. Likewise, the US retains ownership and management of the US Postal Service. There is no doubt Křetínský’s bid for IDS is audacious. It means taking an important UK public company with a long history and strong connections to the monarch and turning it into another cog in a sprawling private empire. The next government should take a tough stance. Privatising the business and listing it on the stock exchange, where companies are forced to be transparent about much of their activities, is one thing. Selling it to a private financier whose operations are largely overseas is quite another.",

        "title": "Virgin Australia is rostering pilots ‘closer to the limit’ of fatigue, watchdog tells Senate estimates",
        "content": "The aviation safety regulator believes Virgin Australia is rostering pilots “closer to the limits” of anti-fatigue standards, amid fears some are working 12-hour days back-to-back but are hesitant to report feeling tired out of fear of losing shifts. Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Casa) officials’ comments at Senate estimates on Wednesday evening followed revelations in the Guardian that pilots had repeatedly raised concerns over Virgin’s rostering system adding to fatigue levels. As Virgin Australia and the Transport Workers’ Union (TWU) remain in a standoff over a proposal to strip pilots of six days’ annual leave during negotiations for a new enterprise agreement, email chains between pilots and management as well as pilot-only discussion groups raised frustration at what they allege was management’s failures to recognise the fatigue issue. The correspondence seen by Guardian Australia revealed anger at outdated roster software which they claim has not been replaced despite a promise to do so by the owners of the airline, private equity firm Bain Capital. In addition, there is an alleged reliance on routinely scheduling pilots to work maximum shift lengths – 12 hours and longer in the event of delays – on back-to-back days, while allowing for just the legal minimum rest period of 12 hours. Matthew Bouttell, the executive manager of Casa’s regulatory oversight division, responded to questions from Labor senator Tony Sheldon about the pilots’ concerns, as well as the results of a TWU survey of 180 pilots – of the roughly 1,000 who work at Virgin – which showed that 85% said the rostering system had affected how they manage their fatigue. Bouttell and fellow Casa leaders explained that while there are strict maximum shift lengths and minimum recovery periods for smaller air operators, more mature airlines such as Virgin have bespoke fatigue risk management systems approved by Casa that could lead to slightly longer days for pilots because of other mitigating strategies. However, Bouttell conceded Casa believed Virgin’s rostering system had been nearing approved fatigue limits. “There’s been adjustments to their roster where they’re getting closer to the limits of that fatigue risk management system,” he said. Bouttell also said that, in the last 28-day pilot roster period, “we understand that 45 crew removed themselves from duty due to fatigue” – a figure which represents just under 5% of pilots at the airline. Bouttell said pilots self-reporting fatigue and refusing a shift was a “great example” of the airline’s fatigue risk management system working. Sheldon then noted “there’s a wealth of advice to say the pilots’ capacity to make an individualistic decision is extremely limited”. In addition to concerns that self-reporting fatigue leads to less pay if they refuse a shift, reported by Guardian Australia, Sheldon noted the potential for pilots to fear that repeatedly turning down shifts could adversely affect how their manager sees them. Steve Campbell, the executive manager of national operations and standards at Casa, responded that “we’d be very concerned if pilots did have that sort of repercussions for walking off or reporting fatigue, that’s where we would be very concerned”. “I’m not aware of any of that [at Virgin],” Campbell said. Pip Spence, the chief executive of Casa, said that after “we saw the article that was in the press on Friday, we engaged closely with Virgin”. “We’ll continue to explore to make sure that there is nothing that’s being done that shouldn’t be done. “[But] it can’t be down to the individual. The system has to actually support safe outcomes.” Under Virgin pilots’ current enterprise agreement, which lapses at the end of June, pilots are entitled to 12 days off every 28-day roster period, of which there are 13 periods a year. Virgin Australia is proposing that for six of the 13 roster periods, days off would be cut to 11. The TWU survey of 180 pilots found that 93% intend to vote no to the proposed deal and 88% are specifically unhappy at the planned reduction in days off. Under the proposed deal – which has been agreed with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, a union which represents a majority of pilots at Virgin – pilots would receive a 9.38% pay rise in the first year, and 3% rises in the second and third years, in return for the loss of the six days off. Critics of the proposed deal, including the TWU, note that pilots accepted a 17% pay cut for the last enterprise agreement to help the airline’s pandemic recovery. Virgin Australia was contacted for comment. Responding to questions from Guardian Australia last week, a Virgin Australia spokesperson said the airline “operates under a robust fatigue management system approved by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority” in “extensive consultation with pilots”, adding that “our pilots have the highest number of rostered days off in the industry at 156 per year”. Spence, later in the estimates hearing, said that a review of the fatigue management system would begin within the next 12 to 18 months.",

        "title": "‘Sticky’ inflation is not falling – but it’s not rising, either. Why should that mean another RBA rate hike?",
        "content": "The latest inflation figures released on Wednesday showed that inflation is “sticky” and is no longer falling at the pace it was earlier this year. But while there will be those arguing this means we need higher interest rates, the latest retail spending figures – also released this week – show that’s the last thing the economy needs. There is often a curious bit of fudging around how inflation gets talked about. We sometimes hear the RBA and others worry about “accelerating” inflation, that is, when the growth of prices (inflation) is itself speeding up. Prices as a rule always go up, but what economists suggest they care about is when the amount by which they go up “accelerates”. We see this when the annual inflation figures rise as they did in 2022 and 2023. Over the past year or so prices have still been rising, but the rate of inflation has been falling, or “decelerating”. But, in the past four months, inflation growth hasn’t been accelerating or decelerating. It has been stuck at about 3.5% to 3.6%. This is why you’ll have heard some commentators talk about “sticky” inflation: If the graph does not display click here In the year to April, inflation rose 3.6% up from 3.5% on March. But the monthly inflation figures can be a bit erratic, so we can also use the measure that excludes “volatile items”. On this measure, inflation remained steady at 3.5%. On both measures, however, prices are still rising by more than the RBA’s target ceiling of 3%. And this is where the fudging occurs. Suddenly it is clear some economists don’t actually care so much about “accelerating” inflation – they just care about inflation being above 3%. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It is worth remembering that the 2% to 3% target range is not an immutable economic law of nature; it’s just an arbitrary goal. The RBA’s actual “duty” is to “contribute to the stability of the currency” – which is precisely what we have right now. Yes, inflation is “sticky”, but sticky doesn’t just mean not falling, it also means not rising. And we are not alone in dealing with this. In the past I have noted that Australia’s inflation has essentially gone up and down in line with the United States and, completely unsurprisingly, it has also followed the US in being “sticky”: If the graph does not display click here So does sticky inflation mean we need to hit households again with higher interest rates? Do you really think our economy will be so much better if inflation was “sticky” at, say, 2.9% and thus within the RBA’s target band, instead of where it is now at 3.6%? Is that benefit worth sending 80,000 or so people out of work? I don’t think so. We need to also remember that when we talk about inflation we are talking about the consumer price index. The key aspect is consumers. Are consumers out there acting in a way that would suggest they are the ones driving up prices through strong spending? Not at all. The latest retail trade figures out on Tuesday showed that annual spending in shops rose just 1.3% in the year to April. Given inflation rose to 3.6%, that means we actually bought a lesser volume of things in April this year than we did a year ago: If the graph does not display click here It’s also worth noting how weak that 1.3% growth is. Over the past 30 years the average annual growth of retail spending has been about 4.8%: If the graph does not display click here In the years before the pandemic, Australia’s economy was pretty anaemic. Spending was down and there was little demand in the economy, and yet by comparison that looks like a golden period compared with now. That 4.8% average growth includes the increase in prices. So given inflation is higher now than it has been in the past, you would expect the amount of money we are spending in the shops is naturally higher because the cost of things is rising faster. But no. We also see this lack of spending when we look at the actual volume of retail spending. During the pandemic, there were a lot of falls and spikes in how much we bought because of the lockdowns. In early 2020 we bought a lot of stuff. But since then we have bought less and less. This was expected, but the amount we spent didn’t just fall back to the long-term trend level; it has fallen well past that: If the graph does not display click here In the first three months of this year we bought about 2% less stuff from shops than the long-term trend – that’s about $2.4bn less. This also aligns with our total consumption – which includes other things beside retail, such as petrol, rent, insurance and medical bills. Our total consumption never recovered fully from the pandemic to be back at the level that would have been expected: If the graph does not display click here Does this suggest households going out spending wildly and needing another rate rise to teach them a lesson? Compare this with the mining boom years – a period in which it was obvious to all that the economy was running hot with strong wage growth and increased spending (and ever more tax cuts and handouts from the Howard government): If the graph does not display click here Now that was a case of excess demand. What we are seeing now is not consumers spending either more than expected or in a manner that would drive up prices. The retail figures show that households are largely reducing the amount of things they are buying and adjusting their purchases to cheaper items. Inflation might be sticky, but it is not the fault of consumers. And another rate rise would be just punishing Australians for something they had no role in causing.

        "title": "Orange-juice makers consider using other fruits after prices go ‘bananas’",
        "content": "Orange juice makers are considering turning to alternative fruits such as mandarins as wholesale prices have “gone bananas” amid fears of poor harvests in Brazil. Prices of orange juice concentrate reached a new high of $4.95 (£3.88) a lb on futures markets this week after growers in the main orange producing areas of Brazil said they were expecting the harvest to be 24% down on last year at 232m 40.8kg boxes – worse than the 15% fall previously predicted. Orange trees in Brazil have been suffering from citrus greening, an incurable disease, after extreme heat stress and drought during their key flowering period in the latter part of last year fuelled by the climate crisis. The predicted poor crop in Brazil, which accounts for 70% of all orange juice exports, marks the third difficult global harvest in a row. As well as problems in Brazil, Florida in the US has been hit by a series of hurricanes and the greening disease, which is spread by sap-sucking insects and turns the fruit bitter before killing the tree. The series of poor harvests has limited manufacturers’ ability to ride out the current difficulties by mixing the new crop with frozen juice – which normally has a two-year lifespan. “This is a crisis,” Kees Cools, the president of the International Fruit and Vegetable Juice Association (IFU) told the Financial Times. “We’ve never seen anything like it, even during the big freezes and big hurricanes.” The IFU has said it is considering lobbying for a rewrite of UN-level food regulations so that orange juice can contain other citrus fruits, as well as pursuing rule changes at the country level. Francois Sonneville, a senior beverages analyst at Rabobank, said consumer demand for orange juice was down by about a fifth, compared with last year, as the price had “gone bananas” and consumer habits had changed. “The global orange juice industry is in crisis. The Florida industry has all but disappeared, and Brazilian groves are plagued by disease, rising costs, and unfavourable growing conditions, leaving global orange juice supplies at their lowest point in decades,” he said. Sonneville said drinks makers would have to either use lower quality juice, create mixed juices with other fruits such as apple, mango or grapes, or charge consumers higher prices. He was sceptical that mandarins could be used to replace oranges as this would involve new expense in transporting the fruit to a processor. The problems would persist, he said, as it took a long time to plant new orange groves and farmers were considering other options as demand was diminishing while they faced problems with disease and high labour costs in Florida. “You would have to think hard about planting a tree [that would last] for the next 25 years as next year prices could be lower again,” Sonneville added. • This article was amended on 30 May 2024 to clarify that the price for Brazilian oranges was for concentrate, not for juice as an earlier version said; and that the record high was on the futures, not the commodities, market.",

        "title": "Thames Water urged to ‘get a grip’ on testing water supply after illness outbreak",
        "content": "Steve Reed, Labour’s shadow environment secretary, has urged Thames Water to “get a grip” and test treatment works “urgently” after it emerged over the weekend that the company had tested the water at only one property. Over the last two weeks, dozens of people in Beckenham, south-east London, have reported becoming unwell with diarrhoea and vomiting. The symptoms in most cases have lasted for an unusually long time – up to two weeks. They have also been severe, with multiple people hospitalised, including an eight-year-old boy. Last Wednesday, Thames Water tested the water at the property of one person who had become unwell; the results came back clear. Since then others who are unwell in Beckenham have asked for a test. Thames initially said that since its initial tests came back clear, it did not need to conduct further tests. Thames has also not tested the wider supply or the treatment facilities specifically as a result of this suspected outbreak. Syreeta Brown lives in Beckenham and her family has been unwell with diarrhoea and vomiting. She and her daughter experienced mild symptoms, but her eight-year-old son has been severely unwell for 12 days and was briefly hospitalised. Thames Water rebuffed her requests to test her water. But after being contacted by the Guardian, Thames sent a technician to take samples from her tap on Monday. “Thames Water’s response has felt very dismissive,” she said. “We’ve got two kids so of course we have dealt with diarrhoea and vomiting over the years but this was just not normal. We went to hospital after I went downstairs to discover he threw up, and was too weak to call for help. He was downstairs, he was lying in it and couldn’t call for help. Kids get bugs, this just felt different.” She first tried calling the water company, but could not get through. She then used their WhatsApp service, through which operators told her not to worry and refused to test her tap water because they had already tested one property in the area. She said: “When I had seen that they tested only one property, I thought why would you test just one property? It just seems a bit odd.” Others who live in the area have said they have found it difficult to get a response from Thames Water when they have suffered from illness and asked for a test. Reed said: “Thames Water must get a grip, be honest with the public and test treatment works in the area urgently.” Speaking about the sewage scandal more broadly, Reed said that a Labour government would put the water companies under tough special measures. “We will give the regulator new powers so law-breaking water bosses face criminal charges and block their multimillion pound bonuses until they clean up their toxic filth.” The Drinking Water Inspectorate has urged water companies to test thoroughly when asked to do so by customers, and told concerned people to contact them if their provider is not testing sufficiently. A DWI spokesperson said: “Water companies are required to adhere to the water supply (water quality) regulations 2016. These regulations include statutory responsibilities for sampling drinking water, investigating concerns identified in the water supply system and reporting to the Drinking Water Inspectorate. This includes a requirement for water companies to investigate and take steps to determine if and why water quality is or is not meeting the specified requirements. If consumers are not satisfied with the response provided by their water company, they can contact the Drinking Water Inspectorate, who will investigate the company response as a complaint.” The UK Health Security Agency confirmed it was monitoring connections between people complaining of illnesses locally, but that it had not so far found enough evidence to put out an alert. Scientists said the reported symptoms sounded like cryptosporidium, or another waterborne disease, but that there could be other reasons for the symptoms. Paul Hunter, a medicine professor from the University of East Anglia, said: “Cryptosporidium is the top, vomiting does occur but is not usually pronounced. You rarely see blood in the diarrhoea. There is a lot of crypto around at present. Giardia is another possibility, again watery diarrhoea no blood, but the characteristic feature is bloating and flatulence. They also tend to report abdominal pain. Salmonella infections can last quite some time as well. Stool can be watery or bloody, people may have a fever and may or may not report abdominal pain.” Tim Walsh, professor of medical microbiology at the University of Oxford, added: “This will be food-/water-borne outbreak and is likely to have come from a common source. Should be easy to track down with decent retrospective epidemiology data and microbiology.” This month, unsafe drinking water led to more than 100 cases of cryptosporidium in the Brixham area of Devon. About 17,000 households and businesses were told by South West Water not to use their tap water for drinking without boiling and cooling it first after cryptosporidium was detected in the water supply. A Thames Water spokesperson confirmed there has been no specific testing of the treatment centres or local works as a result of the concerns from customers, but added that more tap tests have been done. They are still waiting for some results. They said: “We can confirm there are no water quality concerns in the central Sydenham water zone. We take all customer complaints of illness very seriously and have processes in place for investigating any contacts from customers. “Our technicians have collected samples from a number of properties as part of our process. Initial on-site testing has not indicated any aesthetic [taste, smell, look] issue with the water. Samples were also collected for laboratory analysis and of the results we have received back, show no concerns.”",

        "title": "Ofwat considers cutting sewage fines for financially struggling water firms",
        "content": "Ofwat, the water regulator for England and Wales, is understood to be considering cutting fines for sewage-dumping water companies if they are facing financial pressures. According to the Financial Times, which first reported the plan, the regulator intends to draw up a “recovery regime” for Thames Water, which is facing collapse or restructuring owing to its high debts, and others that find themselves in similar positions. Under the proposals, the companies could face fewer or no fines for water outages and sewage leaks and instead be encouraged to invest in infrastructure, in an effort to reduce the threat of nationalisation. Other debt-laden water companies, including Southern Water, South East Water and Yorkshire Water, may also be eligible for the recovery regime. The water industry has long been lobbying for such measures, with sources briefing ministers and journalists that fining companies such as Thames Water over sewage spills is like “shooting the company in the leg and then expecting them to win the race”. Their argument is that the large penalties make it harder to invest in remedying the situation. Under the plans seen by the FT, the utilities would be given lower targets for reducing sewage and water leaks and outages, in exchange for more regulatory oversight for a period of up to five years. Shares in England’s water companies rose on Wednesday morning after the publication of the FT’s story. Shares in United Utilities, which has historically been fined hundreds of thousands of pounds at a time for outages and sewage spills, were up 2.6%, leading the FTSE 100 risers. Severn Trent, which recently was hit with a £2m fine for pollution, rose 1.4%, while on the smaller FTSE 250 index, Pennon Group was 2.2% higher. Ofwat is increasingly coming into the crosshairs of the opposition parties. The Guardian understands Labour is looking at plans to reform the regulatory system that could involve reshaping Ofwat, while the Liberal Democrats are calling for it to be scrapped and replaced with a stronger body. The Lib Dem environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: “Any attempt to let these polluting giants off the hook would be an utter disgrace. This plan is proof Ofwat should be scrapped. This Conservative government has allowed this toothless regulator to stagger on too long. It is time someone finally stood up to these water firms.” MPs including Labour’s Clive Lewis and John McDonnell have been pushing for a nationalisation of all water companies, starting with Thames Water. This is not Labour policy, but Thames Water may have to be temporarily nationalised if it fails. Campaigners have spoken against the Ofwat proposals. Ash Smith of Windrush Against Sewage Pollution said: “Privatised water companies feed on captive billpayers and the ability to break the law with occasional token fines that achieve nothing as shareholders and senior executives continue to profit. “The industry captured regulators long ago and is frightening politicians with debt mountains and the results of 34 years damage from what has been shown by expert analysis to have been no more than a financial scam.” Thames Water’s shareholders recently refused to give the company £500m of emergency funding after labelling its business plan “uninvestable”. The Guardian revealed last month that under plans being drawn up in Whitehall, codenamed Project Timber, ministers would turn Britain’s biggest water company into a publicly owned arm’s-length body. Thames Water was privatised in 1989 with no debt. In the decades since, the water supplier has taken on more debt to help fund its infrastructure projects while paying large dividends to investors, most notably the Australian investment bank Macquarie. Ofwat declined to comment.",

        "title": "Royal Mail owner agrees to £3.57bn takeover by Czech billionaire",
        "content": "The takeover of Royal Mail by the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský has edged closer after its owner agreed terms and conditions on a £3.57bn offer. In an update to the market on Wednesday, the postal service’s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), said it had accepted a cash offer from Křetínský’s EP Group. The deal means Křetínský, who made his fortune in energy and owns a minority stake in one of the main gas pipelines from Russia into Europe, would pay 360p a share for the 73% of the struggling postal service he does not already own. IDS shares rose by 3% to 331p when markets opened – still far short of EP’s offer, suggesting the market remains unconvinced the deal will definitely go through. Shareholders are still waiting to hear whether the British government will decide to examine the sale of the formerly state-owned service to a foreign buyer under the National Security and Investment Act, which gives ministers the power to block the sale of companies considered part of critical national infrastructure. Earlier this month, IDS bosses held a meeting with the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, to discuss the bid and reforms to the universal service obligation (USO), which guarantees delivery to every home in the UK six days a week. A shareholder vote is scheduled for the annual general meeting on 25 September. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, had previously said that any bid would face a “normal” security review but the government was not opposed to EP’s ownership in principle. Labour, which is forecast to form the next government after the 4 July election, welcomed the assurances given by Křetínský and said the party would ensure they were adhered to if it won power. Křetínský’s team has proposed undertakings and contractual commitments with the government and unions, including: Retaining Royal Mail’s proposals for the USO for a first-class postal service to anywhere in the country for a fixed price six days a week for a period of at least five years. IDS has suggested second-class post could be reduced to every other weekday. Headquarters and tax residency to remain in the UK for five years. Maintaining base salaries and benefits for staff for at least two years. No changes to Royal Mail’s ownership for three years. EP also said it does not intend to make any material changes to the overall headcount or reduce the number of frontline workers, and will speak to unions about extending the current agreement of no compulsory redundancies past April 2025. Royal Mail has asked for permission to reduce second-class letter deliveries from six days a week to every other day, a change supported by EP Group. This would see a 7,000-9,000 net reduction in daily delivery routes, and up to 1,000 voluntary redundancies. Royal Mail’s largest union, the Communication Workers Union, said it would meet Křetínský next week to seek a reset in employee and industrial relations and further commitments on the future of the company. A CWU spokesperson said that the current contractual obligations and time limitations in the deal were not “good or strong enough”. “We’ll be looking for pension guarantees, we’ll be looking for a stake for the employees in the future ownership model of the business,” the CWU’s general secretary, Dave Ward, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday. “I think it’s about testing Křetínský as to whether he’s got any plans for investing in the workforce and investing in growth strategies for the company, or whether his intentions are purely to asset-strip the company.” In addition to running the postal service, Royal Mail also owns about 1,300 properties, including a number of highly valuable London sites, such as those in Paddington and Farringdon. In 2019, it sold a prime London site in Nine Elms near Battersea for £101m. The formal submission of the £3.57bn bid, which had been improved from an earlier £3.1bn offer that IDS had said significantly undervalued the company, came in hours before a “put up or shut up” deadline of 5pm on Wednesday. The EP offer could be worth up to £3m to Royal Mail’s current and former directors, while postal staff who held on to shares they were given during the 2013 privatisation could get a windfall of up to nearly £3,400. The IDF chief executive, Michael Seidenberg, could recoup £264,000 from the 71,400 shares he owns, while the chair, Keith Williams, is in line to receive £210,000. Seidenberg was also granted up to 436,000 shares for through a long-term incentive plan that could be worth up to £1.6m under the EP offer. Křetínský, who has been nicknamed the “Czech Sphinx” because of his reluctance to speak in public, has an expanding portfolio in the UK, with stakes in West Ham football club and Sainsbury’s. One of the Czech Republic’s wealthiest citizens, Křetínský made his fortune from gas and coal, including a minority stake in Eustream, a Slovakian pipeline that carries gas from Russia to western Europe and Ukraine. In 2018, he controversially bought a stake in the French newspaper Le Monde, which was met with resistance from editors and journalists over his background in heavily polluting coal companies, and fears that he could seek influence over the paper. Křetínský told the Times last summer he would not want to tamper with the editorial independence of the paper. An EP spokesperson also added that the group planned to phase out all coal from its portfolio by 2030 and it was a big investor in renewable energy. He sold his shares in Le Monde last September to co-owner Xavier Niel, who said they would be transferred into a trust. In a statement on Wednesday morning, Křetínský said he had the utmost respect for Royal Mail’s history and traditions and understood that owning the company came with enormous responsibility. He added: “But IDS’s market is evolving quickly, and it must accelerate its transformation and investments into modernisation to keep up with the competition. “We will support the business in the next critical phase of its transformation and beyond, providing our experience and financial resilience to support the management team.”",

        "title": "Liquid Death: the viral canned water brand killing it with gen Z",
        "content": "What’s in a name? Well, if you ask the makers of the viral water brand Liquid Death, the answer is about $1.4bn. Anyone with tickets to a festival this summer is likely to be struck by the canned drink with the alarming name that gen Z devotees are carrying around with them. But the trendy beverage is nowhere near as sinister as it seems. In fact, it’s just water in a can. Despite not selling a particularly innovative product, the independently owned Liquid Death, founded in 2017, is valued at more than a billion dollars. Its global sales were worth $263m last year. The company boasted “triple-digit” growth for the third consecutive year, becoming one of the fastest-growing water and iced tea brands in the world. In Britain the brand secured its first supermarket deals with Nisa and the Co-op and is also available in Tesco. But if the product on offer is simply water in a can – sometimes sparkling and flavoured – the like of which has been available for some time on both sides of the Atlantic, why the hype around this drink? The success is all down to clever marketing, experts say. The name itself uses shock value and humour, and, with a barrage of PR stunts – one of which included paying a “witch” to go to the Super Bowl and hex one of the teams from the stands – the company’s growth shows the power of creating a memorable brand. If that brand is so out of step with your competitors that it sometimes gets mistakenly stacked in the beer aisle, instead of with the other waters, all the better. Alex Beckett, director of food and drink at the analyst Mintel, said: “The world has been crying out for a water that refers to back sweat in its advertising, is mistakenly stocked on Tesco’s beer fixtures and takes design cues from Skeletor’s fever dreams. “The consumer appetite for rule-breaker brands is fierce in these bleak times and only heightened in bottled water, where the sector’s potential as a healthy choice is spoiled by sustainable concerns and mediocre brand voices.” Megan Dorian, the founder of Orange PR and Marketing, said: “Its marketing stunts, including its recent campaign to give away a jet, create buzz, and generate significant media coverage, which amplifies its brand presence without the need for traditional advertising spends. “This kind of guerrilla marketing appeals particularly to generation Z [those born after 1995], who value brands that are willing to push boundaries and entertain. Fans of the brand enjoy the ‘What’s next?’ element.” When Liquid Death launched, its “murder your thirst” slogan was called “toxic masculinity run rampant” and seen as a gimmick. It comes in a tall can emblazoned with a skull. Many were sceptical, thinking it was just an attempt to sell expensive water to young people – its Tesco price point is £5.50 for four 500ml still water cans. But, as they say, there is no such thing as bad publicity. Within a couple of months, the brand had 100,000 fans on Facebook. Its founder, a former graphic designer, Mike Cessario, wanted to hydrate young people at parties in a unique way. He said a lot of rival brands were unhealthy. “We wanted to give people permission to participate in this cool rock’n’roll brand without needing to consume something gross,” he has said. Rachel Egan, a marketing expert, said the brand was getting “gen Z marketing spot-on” because it speaks to their concerns, such as the climate crisis. Another of the company’s mottoes is “death to plastic” and it says its aluminium cans are “infinitely recyclable”. “I even saw a flavour called ‘Dead Billionaire’ on their social media,” Egan added. When the water launched, its fans ranged from young people who wanted to party without booze to artists and activists. The brand also collaborated with Tony Hawk selling skateboard decks printed with the legendary skater’s blood to raise money for charity. Dorian said: “The combination of a memorable brand and a commitment to social responsibility makes it a compelling choice for the eco-conscious consumer. Moreover, their commitment to sustainability is not just a marketing tactic but a core part of their brand identity, further solidifying their appeal. She added: “Liquid Death has effectively created a lifestyle brand rather than just a beverage. By integrating into music festivals and extreme sports events, it has fostered a sense of community among its consumers.” But brands that live fast can often die young. Even a sustainable water brand is at risk of burning out. Jane Ostler, from the analysts Kantar, said Liquid Death needed to be careful it did not become a short-lived fad. “A clever attitude may seemingly get you a long way, but as a long-term play [the company] needs to be able to predispose more people to the brand. “At the end of the day, it is just water, so it’s limited in the margin increases it can sustain, and the packaging is something other brands can copy and are soon likely to adopt. Renegade branding is only one part of the equation.”",

        "title": "Boohoo backtracks on plan to pay bosses £1m bonuses",
        "content": "The online fashion specialist Boohoo has backtracked on a plan to pay three top executives £1m each in bonuses after reporting widening losses and falling into debt. The move comes after shareholders complained that bonuses were going to be awarded to directors despite the chief executive, John Lyttle, and Boohoo’s co-founders, Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane, missing bonus targets on sales, profits and cashflow as well as environmental and IT aims. Investors had been due to vote on 20 June on whether to approve the remuneration plan, which was announced last week in Boohoo’s annual report. It showed the retail group, which owns Debenhams, Warehouse, Dorothy Perkins and Pretty Little Thing, built up net debts of £95m in the year to the end of February – down from almost £6m of net cash a year before – after losses widened 76% to £160m and sales fell to £1.8bn. The difficult year meant the three bosses were set to receive no bonus but the group’s remuneration committee said in the annual report that it had awarded them a one-off bonus of £1m each, 30% of which would have been in cash and the rest in shares. The committee said it wanted to make the award because a zero bonus “is not an accurate reflection of the excellent work carried out during the year to set the business up for future success” and that it would not “ensure that the management team is motivated and retained throughout the next financial year which will be pivotal for the group’s long-term success”. However, in a short statement released on Tuesday, Boohoo revealed it was backtracking and had “decided not to implement the incentive plan at this time” after it had “engaged with certain shareholders”. That came after a report in the Times that one major shareholder was “furious” about the change to the bonus scheme while another said it was “outrageous” that proposals for the one-off bonus been released in the annual report without consulting investors first. The loss of the awards means Kamani’s pay for the year will be just under £503,000, Kane’s just under £524,000 and Lyttle’s £713,175. Both Kamani and Lyttle earned more than £1m in the year before and Kane earned £986,984. The latest upset comes after a string of wrangles between Boohoo’s founders and shareholders over bonus payouts. Last year, shareholders narrowly approved a new “growth share plan” under which Lyttle could receive a maximum of £50m in Boohoo shares, part of a total £175m payout to executives, if the company’s share price reaches 395p – and remains there within a 90-day average window within five years. Boohoo executives would start to receive initial payouts once the share price returned to 95p, close to the level it was at in February 2022. It currently stands at less than 35p. Kane, who co-founded Boohoo in 2006 along with the executive chairman Kamani, would also receive a bonus under the scheme.",

        "title": "Sales in UK shops bounce back as inflation slows",
        "content": "Sales in British shops have bounced back in May, according to retail data that suggests slowing inflation is encouraging customers to buy more. A net balance of +8% of retailers told a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey that sales volumes were up this month compared with the same period a year earlier – a sharp improvement on the -44% year-on-year figure for April. The balance is the difference between companies who answered that the number of items was “up” or “down”. May marked the most positive monthly reading for the CBI distributive trades survey since December 2022. Alpesh Paleja, the CBI lead economist, said there were signs of a recovery in retail in the short term. “Falling inflation, and continuing real wage growth will contribute to a healthier consumer outlook, in turn supporting the retail sector further,” he said. The figures are likely to be seized on by Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, with much of the prime minister’s justification for calling a summer election based around his claim that “the economy is turning a corner”. May’s better data follows poor sales values in April and March that were blamed on bad weather and the ongoing cost of living crisis. The amount of goods bought in April also dropped 2.3% month on month, according to Office for National Statistics data, with furniture, clothing, sports equipment, and games and toys among the big ticket items customers elected to do without. The fall was partly blamed on Easter falling earlier than usual, at the end of March. Shop prices are also growing more slowly, according to the CBI’s measure of selling price inflation. Inflation was at its slowest since August 2020 and below its long-run average, with the expectation of only a slight pickup in June. This matched earlier data from the British Retail Consortium showing that store prices grew at an annual rate of 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% the previous month. This was a huge drop from the high of 9% reached in May 2023 and the slowest price growth since November 2021. The data will be welcomed by the Bank of England as further proof that the economy is cooling as it considers a cut to interest rates in June. However, the long-term picture was less positive. The CBI polled 137 businesses involved in retail, of which 56 were chains, and found that jobs in the sector were shrinking, with employment declining for the seventh consecutive quarter. The number of people employed in retail is also expected to decline, though more slowly, next month. Retailers said they were less likely to invest now than they were in February, demonstrating pessimism about the future state of the economy. “The mixed mood from our survey demonstrates just how nascent the economic recovery is,” Paleja said.",

        "title": "European Central Bank ready to cut interest rates; UK retail sales jump as inflation slows – business live",
        "content": "Time to recap: Several European Central Bank policymakers have indicated that the ECB will cut interest rates at its next meeting, on Thursday 6 June. British retail sales bounced back in May after a slump in April, as slowing inflation helped consumers to spend more. NatWest has apologised to customers after its online and mobile banking services suffered outages on Tuesday morning. Shares in UK water companies have fallen after the Guardian reported that regulator Ofwat is poised to refuse some of the industry’s requests to lift consumer bills sharply. Artificial intelligence pioneer OpenAI is forming a new safety team to make recommendations on “critical safety and security decisions for OpenAI projects and operations”. Fast fashion company Boohoo has abandoned a plan to hand large bonuses to executives who missed financial targets, after a backlash from investors. Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot has added his voice to the chorus of policymakers saying the European Central Bank can start to lower interest rates. In a speech in London today, Knot indicated that the ECB could lower rates once a quarter – in tandem with its quarterly economic forecasts. He explained: “Policy rates will slowly but gradually move to less restrictive levels. Projection round meetings of the Governing Council will be the key meetings for our interest rate decisions.” The ECB should have new forecasts to consider before its June meeting – one reason a rate cut next week is widely expected They’re also due in September, December and March. Knot added “Based on the March projections, optimal policy would have been broadly in line with 3-4 rate cuts. The important takeaway is that, although these interest rate scenarios can provide useful guidance, given the current environment we still have to avoid any commitments on a specific future rate path.” Newsflash: Boohoo has sensationally backed down over a controversial scheme that would have handed sizeable bonuses to directors of the loss-making fast fashion group. Boohoo has told shareholders that it has withdrawn a resolution from next month’s AGM which would have handed £1m bonuses to Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane, its co-founders, and to CEOJohn Lyttle. The u-turn comes after a backlash from some investors, who were gearing up to revolt against the plan when it came to a vote at the AGM on 20th June. Boohoo says that having engaged with “certain shareholders”, it has decided not to implement the Incentive Plan at this time. Kamani, Kane and Lyttle were not due bonuses because they missed financial targets for the last year. However, Boohoo’s remuneration committee agreed to a pay out anyway, citing their “overall performance” and a change of strategy during the year. In the company’s latest annual report, they explained: However, the Remuneration Committee considered at great length the overall formulaic outcomes and determined that they were not reflective of the overall performance of the management team during the financial year. This was against the backdrop of an agreed change in focus by the board during the second half of the year placing greater emphasis on cash and inventory management, to ensure the business continues to be well positioned to capitalise on top line growth going forward. The pound has risen to a two-month high against the US dollar this morning. Sterling is trading at $1.2794, its highest level since 21 March, showing traders have not been spooked by the general election. Goldman Sachs told clients that they do not expect the UK general election to have a major influence on sterling in the short term, adding: Labour leads in the polling averages by about 20ppts, and fiscal space will be relatively limited in the next Autumn Statement, so the space for policy uncertainty in the near term is relatively limited as well. The pound has also benefitted by falling expectations of interest rate cuts this year, with just one quarter-point cut now priced in for 2024. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out “five missions for a decade of national renewal”, and dropped a strong hint that a Labour victory won’t be followed by an emergency budget. Reeves, and Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer, visited Rolls-Royce’s factory in Derby today, for a major speech on the economy. In it, she outlined plans for 40,000 new NHS appointments every single week, a Border Security Command to “smash the criminal gangs and strengthen our borders”, a publicly owned Great British Energy company, an antisocial behaviour crackdown and plans for 6,500 new teachers. Reeves also said Labour will not announce any additional tax rises during the election campaign, insisting “no additional tax rises [are] needed beyond the ones I have set out”. Reeves also ruled out holding an emergency budget if Labour won the election, saying she would not hold a fiscal event without a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility – a process that would take 10 weeks. Shares in UK water companies are falling today, after The Guardian reported that regulator Ofwat is poised to refuse some of the industry’s requests to lift consumer bills sharply. Ofwat’s draft determination, which will set how much water companies can raise bills, has been postponed until after the general election. Many water companies had sought hefty increases, to fund network improvements, but some will receive as little as half of what they have asked. My colleague Anna Isaac reported: Britain’s biggest water monopoly company, Thames Water, which serves more than 16million customers in the London and Thames Valley regions, faces nationalisation unless it can attract vast quantities of fresh capital. It has requested bill rises of 59% – after accounting for inflation – from the regulator. These figures have been rejected by Ofwat based on the latest iteration of Thames’s business and turnaround plans. The documents were described as a “microwave job”, according to sources who have reviewed them. They include “fag-packet figures” and reflect a board whose members appear determined to “sit on a deckchair on the Titanic”, the same sources said. In the City today, Pennon Group’s shares have fallen 3.5% – the top faller on the FTSE 250 share index. On the larger FTSE 100 index, United Utilities and Severn Trent have both lost 2.8%. In the artificial intelligence world, OpenAI – the creator of the ChatGPT chatbot – has set up a new Safety and Security Committee. The new committee is responsible for making recommendations on critical safety and security decisions for all OpenAI projects – a crucial issue, given concerns about the dangers which AI could pose. Its first task is to evaluate and further develop OpenAI’s processes and safeguards over the next 90 days, before making recommendations to its board. OpenAI says it will review them, and then announce its “adopted recommendations”. OpenAI says: OpenAI has recently begun training its next frontier model and we anticipate the resulting systems to bring us to the next level of capabilities on our path to AGI. While we are proud to build and release models that are industry-leading on both capabilities and safety, we welcome a robust debate at this important moment. The commmittee will be led by OpenAI’s chair Bret Taylor, CEO Sam Altman, and directors Adam D’Angelo and Nicole Seligman. Earlier this month, a former senior employee at OpenAI said the company was prioritising “shiny products” over safety, revealing that he quit after a disagreement over key aims reached “breaking point”. And last week, a leading scientist and artificial intelligence campaigner told The Guardian that major tech firms had distracted the world from the existential risk to humanity posed by AI. Also, disappointingly, the retail sector continued to cut staff over the last year, the CBI’s distributive trades survey shows: Less encouragingly, retailers’ investment intentions for the year ahead have deteriorated, the CBI reports: UK retail sales have bounced back this month, new data shows, as slowing inflation encouraged customers to spend in the shops. The latest CBI Distributive Trades Survey shows that UK retail sales grew at their fastest pace since December 2022 in the year to May. A net balance of +8% of retailers reported that sales volumes were up year-on-year, a sharp improvement on the -44% recorded in April [the balance is the difference between firms who answered ‘up’ or ‘down’]. That may be a sign that the economic recovery picked up this month; potentially a boost to Rishi Sunak, as he argues “the economy is turning a corner”. However, a small majority of retailers expect sales to fall moderately next month. Sales were seen as “average” for the time of year – the strongest reading in eight months. The CBI also reports that selling price inflation in the retail sector eased considerably in May, to its lowest since August 2020. A balance of 20% of retailers reported they’d raised their prices, down from 54% in February. That chimes with this morning’s survey from the BRC, showing shop inflation had returned to normal levels. Fewer wholesalers reporting higher prices than in February, too. Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead economist, says: “May’s increase in retail sales adds to the swathe of data pointing to an improvement in activity over the near-term. Falling inflation, and continuing real wage growth will contribute to a healthier consumer outlook, in turn supporting the retail sector further. “That being said, retailers are restrained about their business situation over the coming quarter. Headlines sales are expected to fall moderately next month, and it’s concerning that retailers’ investment intentions have deteriorated noticeably. “The mixed mood from our survey demonstrates just how nascent the economic recovery is. All parties should use this general election campaign to embrace policies which will embed sustainable growth, foster the investment we need to develop a labour market which delivers higher living standards, and to accelerate our transition to net zero.” NatWest has confirmed that the IT problems which affected its services this morning are now resolved. A NatWest spokesperson said: “We are aware that some customers were experiencing difficulties accessing NatWest mobile and online banking this morning. The issue has been resolved and customers are now able to log in as normal. We apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused.” NatWest’s website now declares that its online banking service is “working normally” again. But, it says there is still some service disruption on the mobile app, with some customers unable to view their credit card information on our mobile app. “We’re working hard to fix this, sorry if it’s causing you any issues,” NatWest adds. The IT problems at NatWest could be solved…. The bank has told several customers: The mobile app and online banking service should now be working as expected. Please try logging in as normal. Thank you for your patience and apologies for any inconvenience. If you have other questions or need any further support then please let me know-Erin However, NatWest’s service status page still says there is service disruption with the mobile app and online banking. NatWest says that customers who need to complete a transaction can use their Telephone Banking service, or visit a branches or an ATM. Assuming you can find a branch, of course….. NatWest is closing 98 this year. The IT problems at NatWest have come at a particularly bad time for many customers, as today is payday for many companies: This graph from DownDetector shows how reports of problems using NatWest’s online banking services started building around 6am, and spiked around 7.30am: NatWest’s banking app and online banking service has been hit by a technical glitch, with many users reporting problems. Several NatWest customers have reported problems accessing their bank account this morning, both through the app and through online banking. They’ve been told that the issue is being investigated “with the highest priority”. NatWest says: Some of our customers are experiencing issues with our mobile app and Online Banking service. We’re sorry for any inconvenience caused and we’re working hard getting everything back up and running for you. We will share an update when we have more information. NatWest adds that bank cards should still be working, though: Newsflash: Eurozone consumers have lowered their inflation expectations last month, which may give the ECB another spur to cut interest rates in June. The central bank’s monthly survey has found that inflation expectations over the next 12 months has fallen to 2.9%, down from 3.0% a month earlier. Expectations for inflation three years time has dropped to 2.4% from 2.5%. Although these readings are some way above the ECB’s 2% target – and the latest inflation rate of 2.4% – policymakers could be encouraged by the direction of travel. Yesterday another ECB governing council member, Olli Rehn, indicated that a rate cut in June was nailed on. In a speech, Rehn said inflation in the euro area was falling in a “sustained way”, adding: “Thanks to this disinflationary process, inflation is converging to our 2% target in a sustained way, and the time is thus ripe in June to ease the monetary policy stance and start cutting rates.” The Bank of England’s outgoing deputy governor has hit out at critics of the central bank’s record in controlling inflation. Ben Broadbent, who leaves the BoE in June, it is “absolute tripe” to claim that the bank’s monetary policy committee failed to foresee surging inflation over the past three years because its members shared similar backgrounds. Turning the accusation back on the BoE’s critics, Broadbent told The Times: “I think the place where there is the most groupthink is among those who [accuse people of] groupthink. It is something that people trot out. I dismiss the charge pretty strongly.” The BoE, like other central banks, has been criticised for expecting the surge in inflation during the Covid-19 pandemic to be temporary. Broadbent, though, argues that the economic hibernation of the pandemic years exposed “the limits of normal macroeconomics”, leaving forecasters struggling, and that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had provided a second, unforseen, inflation shock. Broadbent said disinflation — a decrease in the rate of inflation — was “getting there”, after UK inflation dropped to 2.3% last month. He added that this “doesn’t mean [rate cuts] have to be made right now”. UK retailers are declaring that shop price inflation has fallen back to “normal levels”, after the pace of price rises eased again this month. Prices in British shops rose at the slowest pace in two and a half years in May, according to the British Retail Consortium It reports that annual shop price inflation slowed to 0.6% in May from 0.8% in April, the smallest increase since November 2021. Food inflation slowed for a 13th month in a row to 3.2% from 3.4%, its lowest since February 2022, while prices of non-food goods fell by 0.8% in annual terms. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: “Shop price inflation has returned to normal levels, at just 0.6%. This was helped by slowing food inflation, with fresh food inflation falling to its lowest level since November 2021. Meanwhile, ambient food inflation remained stickier, especially for sugary products which continued to feel the effects of high global sugar prices. In non-food, retailers cut furniture prices in an attempt to revive subdued consumer demand for big-ticket items, and football fans have been able to grab some bargains on TVs and other audio-visual equipment ahead of this summer’s Euros.” This could cheer Rishi Sunak, who called the general election just hours after the official headline rate of UK inflation fell – although not by as much as expected – last week. But, although the speed of price rises has fallen, this still leaves the price level sharply higher than two or three years ago. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. European consumers and businesses can look forward to lower borrowing costs, with the European Central Bank looking firmly on track to cut interest rates next week. With inflation having fallen close to the ECB’s 2% target, several policymakers are hinting that the bank will be able to lower rates at its meeting next week. Philip Lane, the ECB’s chief economist, declared in a speech in Dublin: At our June meeting, if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. After the speech, Lane told reporters that “The discussion about a rate cut next week is not a declaration of victory,” according to the Financial Times. French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau was even more categorical, declaring a June rate cut “a done deal” unless there is a shock. Villeroy de Galhau, who like Lane is a member of the ECB’s governing council, told Germany’s Boersen Zeitung newspaper: “Barring a surprise, the first rate cut in June is a done deal, but afterwards we have several degrees of freedom,” Villeroy de Galhau argued that the ECB should keep its options open about possible future cuts, adding: “I don’t say that we should commit already on July, but let us keep our freedom on the timing and pace.” A cut in June would make the ECB one of the first major central banks to lower rates in the current cycle, after the Swiss National Bank which surprised the markets with a rate cut in March. Currently, the ECB’s deposit facility – paid to banks who make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem – is a record high of 4%.

        "title": "Royal Mail and Anglo American shareholders braced for final takeover offers",
        "content": "Shareholders in Royal Mail’s owner and in the mining company Anglo American are awaiting a final deadline on Wednesday for firm offers that could see two of the UK’s most prominent companies fall into foreign ownership. Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský has made an approach to International Distributions Services (IDS), which runs Royal Mail, while Australia’s BHP is trying to buy its rival Anglo American, a stalwart of London’s FTSE 100 index. Under UK takeover laws, companies have a limited window after making an approach to make a firm offer or walk away – known in the City as the “put up or shut up” deadline. For both businesses the cutoff point is 29 May. Of the two, the bid for Royal Mail’s owner by Křetínský’s EP Group, which made its money in coal-fired power stations, appears more likely to succeed. IDS said earlier this month that it was “minded to recommend” the proposal, if a firm offer was made after talks. Křetínský’s bid values the postal service at £3.5bn, although that is still well short of the £5.3bn market value the company reached in late 2021. IDS shares were trading at 324.6p on Tuesday morning, well below the 370p a share offer from EP Group. Shares generally trade below an offer price if enough investors believe there is a significant chance the deal will fall through. On Friday, the IDS board warned in delayed annual results that Křetínský’s bid could create risk around the company’s finances beyond the coming 12 months if the new owners were to struggle to maintain existing loans and secure fresh funding. If Křetínský does make a firm offer, a takeover of the 508-year-old postal service by a foreign firm would face significant political scrutiny. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has said the government would examine the national security implications, and it is likely that whoever wins the 4 July general election would continue that policy. BHP’s attempt to take over Anglo American has so far been more troublesome. Anglo has rejected three takeover offers, the last of which was worth £38.6bn. BHP has raised its offer from an initial £31bn, and some analysts believe there is limited scope to increase the bid, which would already be the largest in the history of the mining sector. A combined company would be a global player in markets for commodities including iron ore, potash, and metallurgical coal used for steelmaking. Anglo American’s copper assets are also thought to be particularly attractive to BHP, because of the metal’s crucial role in the transition to a net zero energy system. Anglo’s chief executive, Duncan Wanblad, has responded to the bid with a strategy to overhaul the 107-year-old company, including a pledge to break up the business and sell its platinum division and its De Beers diamond arm. The bids have attracted particular scrutiny because some analysts are concerned that British businesses are fundamentally undervalued when compared with rivals in other countries. Stuart Clark, the portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, said last week that investors should beware the “comforting short-term boost to investors’ portfolio” from increased mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity. “Instead, there needs to be a renewed focus on improving the competitive landscape for UK business and the UK stock market,” he said. “This, combined with an upturn in economic activity, will do far more to investor returns than the sugar rush of acquisitions.” The deadlines could be extended by the Takeover Panel, the UK’s independent regulator of M&amp;A activity, if the target companies want more time to talk through a deal. Anglo American has already extended its deadline for talks by a week, reportedly after investor pressure to enter negotiations.",

        "content": "The WeWork founder Adam Neumann has shelved his bid to acquire the bankrupt shared office space provider. It emerged earlier this year that Neumann, who was ousted from the business in 2019 following a botched attempt to take it public on the stock market, was seeking to buy the business. His new real estate venture, Flow Global, submitted a bid of more than $500m to take over WeWork and its assets. On Tuesday morning, however, Neumann confirmed that Flow was walking away from his dream to take back control of the firm. “For several months, we tried to work constructively with WeWork to create a strategy that would allow it to thrive,” he told DealBook. “Instead, the company looks to be emerging from bankruptcy with a plan that appears unrealistic and unlikely to succeed.” WeWork, with over $13bn in long-term leases, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last November in order to renegotiate these agreements. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. At its peak, the company had been valued at $47bn as investors including the Japanese multinational SoftBank lined up to back it. As it prepared to go public in 2019, however, analysts gave it a far lower valuation. After it eventually went public, in 2021, its market valuation tumbled to less than $50m. Neumann, 45, stepped down from WeWork in 2019 after its initial failure to go public, and criticism of the firm’s internal culture on his watch. He landed on his feet, however, launching Flow – a real estate venture which raised $350m from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz in 2022. Reuters contributed reporting",

        "title": "Global sales of polluting SUVs hit record high in 2023, data shows",
        "content": "Sales of SUVs hit a new record in 2023, making up half of all new cars sold globally, data has revealed. Experts warned that the rising sales of the large, heavy vehicles is pushing up the carbon emissions that drive global heating. The analysis, by the International Energy Agency, found that the rising emissions from SUVs in 2023 made up 20% of the global increase in CO2, making the vehicles a major cause of the intensifying climate crisis. If SUVs were a country, the IEA said, they would be the world’s fifth-largest emitter of CO2, ahead of the national emissions of both Japan and Germany. Climate-fuelled extreme weather is increasing, with urgent cuts in emissions needed. But emissions from the global transport sector have risen fast in recent years, outside of the Covid pandemic. SUV sales rose 15% in 2023, compared with a 3% rise for conventional cars. The IEA said the main reasons behind the surge in SUVs were the “the appeal of SUVs as a status symbol”, marketing by automakers, and perceptions that they are more comfortable. The IEA also said SUVs caused greater injury to pedestrians in collisions, due to their higher front-ends, and took up more space in cities than regular cars. About 20% of the new SUVs sold in 2023 were pure electric or plug-in hybrids. But the IEA said the larger vehicles needed bigger batteries, putting more pressure on the supply of critical minerals and requiring more electricity to run. Cars running on petrol or diesel have become more efficient. But the IEA’s Laura Cozzi and Apostolos Petropoulos, who did the analysis, said: “The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs has largely nullified the improvements achieved in recent decades.” James Nix, at the thinktank Transport and Environment (T&amp;E), said: “Carmakers in pursuit of higher margins know only one direction: bigger and heavier. New cars are getting wider every year, and are on track to become as wide as buses and trucks. Europe will go the way of North America unless lawmakers step in with EU width limits and national taxes and parking charges which discourage big SUVs.” There were more than 360m SUVs on the roads worldwide in 2023, producing 1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions, up about 10% on 2022. As a result, global oil consumption rose by 600,000 barrels a day, more than a quarter of total growth in oil demand, the IEA said. SUVs weigh 200-300kg more than an average medium-sized car and emit about 20% more CO2. In rich countries, almost 20m new SUVs were sold in 2023, surpassing a market share of 50% for the first time. Globally, 48% of new cars were SUVs and, including older cars, one in four cars on the road today are SUVs, according to the IEA. Sales of electric cars are rising rapidly and 55% of these were SUVs in 2023, the IEA data showed. “Shifting from fossil-fuelled cars to electric vehicles is a key strategy for reaching international energy and climate goals,” Cozzi and Petropoulos said. But they said using fewer materials to produce cars was also “essential for a sustainable future”. Some countries, including France, Norway and Ireland, are working to rein in demand for SUVs, with Paris tripling parking charges for the large vehicles. In March, T&amp;E said that the UK was a “tax haven” for polluting SUVs, as the vehicle excise duty for them in the first year is a fraction of that in other countries. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said in February he would monitor the effectiveness of the Paris plan.",

        "title": "Ofwat poised to refuse most suppliers’ requests for big price rises",
        "content": "Ofwat is poised to refuse most water companies’ requests to ratchet up consumer bills, with some getting as little as half of what they have asked for, the Guardian has learned. The decision from the water watchdog for England and Wales, Ofwat, has been formally delayed until 11 July because of the general election. Its verdict, known as a draft determination, comes amid a growing crisis in the water sector. Britain’s biggest water monopoly company, Thames Water, which serves more than 16million customers in the London and Thames Valley regions, faces nationalisation unless it can attract vast quantities of fresh capital. It has requested bill rises of 59% – after accounting for inflation – from the regulator. These figures have been rejected by Ofwat based on the latest iteration of Thames’s business and turnaround plans. The documents were described as a “microwave job”, according to sources who have reviewed them. They include “fag-packet figures” and reflect a board whose members appear determined to “sit on a deckchair on the Titanic”, the same sources said. Whitehall officials have been increasingly concerned about the politicisation of any nationalisation. The bulk of Thames’s £15bn debt would be pulled on the UK’s balance sheet under renationalisation plans seen by the Guardian, causing a headache for any government facing already straitened public finances. Ofwat is taking advice from the investment bankers Lazard in a bid to avoid the “worst-case scenario” of Thames being pulled into the special administration regime. Lazard is tasked with finding a sweet spot where Thames Water is attractive for investors, but minimises the pressure on consumer bills, sources said. The delay to the publication of the bill increases that companies will be allowed to impose on consumers will add to Thames’s challenges, sources at the supplier said. It will affect Thames’s ability to raise capital as it will struggle to offer a clear picture of its position to prospective investors, they added. Southern Water has requested the highest increase in bills among the utility companies of 91% to £915 a year, while Wessex Water has requested a 50% increase to £822 a year. Thames Water’s is the second highest request for an increase in percentage terms, at 59% to £749, according to figures from the Consumer Council for Water. Rothschild, another investment bank, is advising Thames. Rothschild also advised on the privatisation of Thames in 1989. A Thames Water spokesperson said that any comment before the Ofwat draft decision was published was “premature”. An Ofwat spokesperson said: “Thames Water is a business with a regulatory capital value of £19bn, £2.4bn of liquidity available, annual regulated revenue of £2bn and a new leadership team. They must continue to pursue all options to seek further equity. Safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected, regardless of issues faced by the shareholders.” Estimates of bill increases requested by companies Southern Water – 91% to £915 Thames Water – 59% to £749 Hafren Dyfrdwy – 56% to £676 Severn Trent – 50% to £657 Wessex Water – 50% to £822 Yorkshire Water – 46% to £682 Dŵr Cymru – 43% to £702 United Utilities – 38% to £666 South East Water – 35% £330 Pennon – 33% to £644 Portsmouth Water – 31% to £157 SES – 30% to £315 Anglian Water – 29% to £682 Northumbrian Water and Essex &amp; Suffolk Water – 26% to £530 Affinity Water – 25% to £294 South Staffs &amp; Cambridge Water – 24% to £221 Source: Consumer Council for Water Data note: The figures are estimates which include forecasts for inflation of 2% a year up to 2030 to requests from water companies submitted to Ofwat.",

        "title": "Inflation in UK shops falls amid price cuts on furniture and TVs",
        "content": "Shop price inflation has eased to the lowest level since November 2021 after retailers cut the price of big purchases such as furniture and TVs as households keep a tight rein on spending amid cost of living pressures and poor weather. Prices rose at an annual rate of 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% in April – the slowest pace since November 2021 – according to the latest monitor from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body and the market research firm NielsenIQ. The decrease was led by non-food prices, which fell by an annual rate of 0.8% in May, the second consecutive month of deflation, marking the biggest drop at the shelf-edge since 2021. Food prices rose by 3.2% compared with 3.4% a month before, led by an easing of price increases on fresh food despite concerns about production during the cold wet spring. Mike Watkins, the head of business insight at NielsenIQ, said: “After a number of months of falling input prices, we are now seeing food inflation stabilise and retailers continue to pass on price cuts to shoppers.” After wage rises and tax cuts for many in April, Watkins said consumer sentiment was improving but “unseasonable weather” had put an additional dampener on demand so that promotional activity was likely to continue in an attempt to drive up spending. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “Shop price inflation has returned to normal levels, at just 0.6%. This was helped by slowing food inflation, with fresh food inflation falling to its lowest level since November 2021. Meanwhile, ambient food inflation remained stickier, especially for sugary products which continued to feel the effects of high global sugar prices. “In non-food, retailers cut furniture prices in an attempt to revive subdued consumer demand for big-ticket items, and football fans have been able to grab some bargains on TVs and other audio-visual equipment ahead of this summer’s Euros.” She called on the government to do more to help bring down inflation amid an increased burden on businesses from business rates and other levies. “With an election in a matter of weeks, it is vital that parties detail their support for customers and retailers in their upcoming manifestos,” Dickinson said. The shop inflation figures will feed hopes that the biggest bump in inflation for 40 years has passed, which could prompt the Bank of England to begin cutting interest rates within months to help ease pressure on households. The number of visitors to shopping destinations was down almost 1% year on year in the week to 19 May according to the advisory firm BDO’s regular survey of mid-sized retailers, many of which are fashion chains, showing a 0.5% year on year dip in sales at established stores in the week to 19 May. That was offset by a big jump in online sales to drive a near-4% rise in total sales.",

        "content": "Rachel Reeves will pledge on Tuesday to lead the most “pro-growth” Treasury in UK history if Labour wins the general election. Addressing business leaders, the shadow chancellor is poised to claim her party would “return to the centre ground of politics” by striking a balance between workers’ needs and business interests. She is also expected to say she is committed to delivering economic stability so that “families and businesses can plan for the future” without the risk of “a repeat of the mini-budget”. Labour will instead “offer a government that is pro-worker and pro-business, in the knowledge that each depends upon the success of the other”. In a swipe at Rishi Sunak, Reeves will say the timing of the snap election was a damning indictment of his economic plans: “If he really believed his plan was working, he wouldn’t have called an election now.” She is expected to tell business chiefs: “The general election in five weeks’ time is a chance for the British people to pass judgment on 14 years of economic chaos and decline under the Conservatives. “Fourteen years of chaos that have seen taxes reach a 70-year high. National debt more than double. And the average mortgage holder having to pay £240 more a month after Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget.” Her words will strike the same tone as the Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, who said that claims from Sunak that the UK has turned the corner were “a form of disrespect in itself”. On Monday evening it was also reported that 121 business leaders have leant their support to Labour in a joint letter signed by former executives from JP Morgan, Heathrow, Aston Martin and JD Sports – as well as the Wikipedia founder, Sir Jimmy Wales, and Tom Kerridge, the chef and restauranteur . “We, as leaders and investors in British business, believe it is time for a change,” said the letter to the Times, which was also signed by the founder of the childcare company that Akshata Murty, the prime minister’s wife, previously held shares and the Iceland founder Sir Malcolm Walker, who in 2015 publicly backed the Conservatives. “For too long, our economy has been beset by instability, stagnation and a lack of long-term focus.” Reeves’s speech comes as the shadow chancellor seeks to strike a political balance between the views of businesses and trade unions. Her refusal to rule out all fire-and-rehire employment practices has drawn criticism from union leaders in recent days. The Unite union’s secretary general, Sharon Graham, said Labour’s plans – which exclude an outright ban on the practice – had “more holes than Swiss cheese”. Reeves has since said that the plans still amount to the “biggest ever extension of workplace rights that’s ever been introduced” and that fire-and-rehire would only be tolerated in extreme circumstances such as a company going bankrupt. She also faces further challenges in the coming weeks to illustrate how she can promise to keep a tight hand on the public finances while also rejuvenating ailing public services with fresh investment. Reeves has promised that Labour will not oversee a “return to austerity” as she ruled out increases to income tax or national insurance. Speaking on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she said: “There’s not going to be a return to austerity under a Labour government. We had austerity for five years and that is part of the reason why our economy and our public services are in a mess today.” Reeves added that the party would raise money to fund its pledges by introducing VAT on private school fees, increasing tax on private equity bonuses, extending the windfall tax on energy companies’ profits, and cracking down on non-doms and tax avoidance.",

Nash began flying with the now-defunct Eastern Airlines in 1957 and primarily worked the shuttle flight between Washington DC and Boston so she could be home every night to care for her son, ABC reported. It was the romance and glamor of flying that initially attracted Nash to the job. “I wanted to be a flight attendant from the time I got on the first airplane – I was 16 years old,” she told CNN. “The pilot and the flight attendant walked across the hall and I thought ‘Oh my God,’ and I said that was for me.” At the start of her career, “you had to be a certain height, you had to be a certain weight. It used to be horrible,” she told WJLA. “You put on a few pounds and you had to keep weighing yourself, and then if you stayed that way, they would take ya off the payroll!” In 2022, Nash was honored with the Guinness World Record title for longest-serving flight attendant. She never officially retired from her role with American Airlines and died on 17 May in hospice care after a recent breast cancer diagnosis, according to ABC. “We mourn the passing of Bette Nash, who spent nearly seven decades warmly caring for our customers in the air,” American Airlines said in a statement on social media. “She started in 1957 and held the Guinness World Record for longest-serving flight attendant. Bette inspired generations of flight attendants. Fly high, Bette.” Nash “touched many with her warmth, dedication, and service”, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the union representing American Airlines flight attendants, said in its statement. “RIP, Bette.

        "content": "The government has “achieved very little” in reforms to Great Britain’s railways six years after identifying the need for big changes to improve the situation for passengers and taxpayers, according to an influential parliamentary committee. MPs on the cross-party public accounts committee said the Department for Transport has not paid enough attention to the needs of passengers or taxpayers, six years after a botched introduction of new timetables led to chaos on the rail network and a widespread consensus that deep changes were needed. The government has identified some changes to make to the governance of Britain’s railways, but “many of the proposed reforms and associated benefits are largely on hold until the next parliament when legislation can be passed”, the MPs wrote in a report published on Monday. “While the department is fully aware of what is important to passengers, it has not delivered on the basic things that matter most,” the report said. It added that “poor performance persists across the rail network”, highlighting that 13.7% of trains were delayed and 3.8% were cancelled in the 2022-23 operating year. Parliament will be dissolved on Thursday, after Rishi Sunak called a general election for 4 July. The government is scrambling to get through final pieces of legislation before MPs lose their seats, and parliamentary committees are also racing to finish work before they are disbanded. The public accounts committee said there remains a huge amount of work to be done to realise some of the ambition of reforms to the railways planned by Boris Johnson. The former prime minister announced plans in 2021 to bring in changes that would lead to rapid improvements on Britain’s railways, including a central pledge to set up Great British Railways, a “guiding mind” to oversee the network. Great British Railways (GBR) has still not been set up, despite an original planned launch for March 2024. That has delayed potential savings of up to £1.5bn a year, and the government has still not agreed on fundamental issues such as GBR’s independence, how it would work with commercial operators, and how fares would be set. The Labour party has also committed to setting up GBR if – as polls indicate – it leads the next government. Yet the MPs on the committee also said that there had not been enough focus on shorter-term improvements that will not require legislation. “We are not convinced that the department has paid sufficient attention, in advance of the delayed creation of Great British Railways, to the changes it can make now to improve the situation for passengers and taxpayers,” it wrote. There is no “real sense of urgency” in proposed improvements that could go ahead before GBR, the MPs wrote. Michael Solomon Williams, from the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “Rail reform is taking far too long, leaving passengers to bear the brunt of a system not currently fit for purpose. The government must implement much-needed reforms that prioritise passengers and invest in creating a financially stable railway that benefits the whole economy as a matter of urgency.” The report also criticised the state of affairs for disabled users or others with special access needs. The Department for Transport declined to comment before the general election.",

        "content": "Drivers of bestselling plug-in hybrid cars pay £500 a year more on fuel for their cars than manufacturers’ figures suggest, according to analysis of real-world data, largely because owners tend to charge them less frequently than expected. Laboratory tests of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) suggest that fuel should cost £560 a year, but real-life data suggests the cost is nearly double that, at £1,059 a year, according to analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a climate research group. Plug-in hybrids are being sold by carmakers as a transitional step towards pure battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), and sales of PHEVs in the UK have grown faster than those of all-electric cars during 2024. Hybrids combine a smaller battery with an internal combustion engine. That allows them to be more efficient – saving fuel and reducing carbon emissions – than petrol or diesel-only equivalents. Plug-in hybrids, with a battery that can be externally topped up via a charger cable, are capable of travelling up to about 40 miles without their engine being used. In theory, a PHEV’s battery should be used for almost every journey: 94% of car trips in England are under 25 miles. In practice, however, their owners often do not plug them in, instead relying on their polluting internal combustion engines. The EU’s European Commission in March found that real-world carbon emissions from PHEVs first registered in 2021 were on average 3.5 times higher than in laboratory tests, “largely because they are not being charged and driven fully electrically as frequently as assumed”. The EU figures confirmed that plug-in hybrids still delivered significant fuel savings compared with standard petrol cars. The ECIU found that petrol cars would cost £1,652 a year to fuel. That was 56% higher than for PHEVs, and more than four times more than driving an electric car, which uses energy far more efficiently. Electric car owners on average pay £388 a year to charge if they can do this at home, the ECIU said. Costs would be higher for people dependent on public charging points. Colin Walker, the ECIU’s head of transport, said a “petrol premium” of hundreds of pounds a year still applied to plug-in hybrid cars. “It’s important [potential car buyers] are made aware of the fact that, according to the data, not only do PHEVs produce 350% more CO2 than their manufacturers claim, they won’t deliver fuel savings anywhere near as impressive as they are being led to believe,” he said. Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive, a thinktank arguing for faster adoption of electric cars, said PHEV sales were increasing in Europe and the UK because of tightening emissions rules. However, he said the commission data showed that hybrids were “failing to deliver in the real world”. “This highlights the dangers of passing laws that try to reduce the environmental impact of fossil-fuelled vehicles,” he said. “This approach will always rely on tests that fail to reflect real-world driving or unrealistic claims by manufacturers. The UK is sensibly avoiding this problem by transitioning to a regulatory approach that focuses on cutting out tailpipe emissions altogether and making a clean break with the internal combustion engine.” The UK’s zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate will force manufacturers to sell an increasing proportion of electric cars until sales of new petrol and diesel engines are banned in 2035.",

        "title": "Senior UK politicians call for greater scrutiny of potential Shein IPO ",
        "content": "Senior politicians, including three parliamentary committee chairs, have called for more scrutiny of Shein as the fast-fashion retailer founded in China sets its sights on a London stock market listing. Shein is reportedly in talks to float on the London Stock Exchange after an attempt to float in New York faced regulatory hurdles. The company has risen from relative obscurity to dominate the fast-fashion market and is known for ultra-cheap clothing such as dresses, crop tops and bikinis. It has faced allegations of labour malpractices, with tough scrutiny from the US Congress stalling the company’s efforts to list in New York. Rishi Sunak’s government has appeared eager to woo Shein to London instead. The company’s executive chair, Donald Tang, met Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, in February. But senior British politicians said a Shein listing should not be allowed to go ahead while parliament is dissolved for the general election and the initial public offering (IPO) should be subjected to greater scrutiny. Alicia Kearns, the Conservative chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: “With Shein’s prices so low the London Stock Exchange needs to ask itself, whose suffering is subsiding those prices?” “A company which has failed to make full disclosures about its supply chains as required by UK law, and where there are grave concerns about its factory working conditions has no place in London.” Shein was accused in 2021 of failing to make full disclosures about its supply chains. A spokesperson for the company told the Guardian: “Our modern slavery statement is published and publicly available on our UK website, as required by UK law.” Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of the international development select committee, said: “Transparency in supply chains is vital and something all governments should be demanding. Serious concerns have been raised about the use of modern slavery by Shein which need investigating.” Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the business select committee, said: “It is not ideal that Shein’s floating in London could get the green light without parliamentary scrutiny. Parliament needs to satisfy itself that the concerns raised recently by the US Congress of forced labour in Shein’s supply chains have been thoroughly addressed.” If the London IPO were to go ahead, it would be one of the City’s biggest ever corporate listings and a boost to its reputation as an international financial centre. Shein’s UK business made £1.1bn in sales last year, and a pre-tax profit of £12.2m in the 16 months to 31 December 2022, according to documents filed with Companies House. Globally, the group made $30bn in revenues last year. In late 2022, it pledged to invest in improving standards at its supplier factories. The government has sought to attract more firms to the London Stock Exchange after the Cambridge-based chipmaker Arm snubbed ministers by opting for the Nasdaq in New York. Sajid Javid, the former chancellor, is among several figures who have been approached about taking a role at the company, Sky reported last week. The Guardian approached Javid for comment. Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Uyghurs, said: “When it comes to a company like Shein and whom it uses in its labour and supply chains in China, we need more serious scrutiny.” David Alton, a crossbench peer and Uyghur rights campaigner, said: “No decision should be made while parliament is dissolved, and should be subject to detailed scrutiny by select committees in both Houses.” Kate Larsen, a former senior manager for corporate responsibility at Burberry who trains investors on ethical supply chains, said there were many concerns about Shein’s practices. “Shein order their garments from hundreds and maybe thousands of small workshops mostly in China – you just cannot monitor labour standards as well across thousands of small supply chain partners,” Larsen said. “Their business model is that mostly they don’t ship big container loads, you order a garment and you just get that package straight from China most of the time. This means they can often bypass customs, import taxes and inspections.” A spokesperson for Shein said: “We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously. Shein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.” “Shein is investing millions of pounds in strengthening governance and compliance across our supply chain. Our regular supplier audits are showing a consistent improvement in performance and compliance by our supplier partners. This includes improvements in ensuring that workers are compensated fairly for what they do.”",

        "title": "Goldman Sachs pay pot for bankers surges by more than 20%",
        "content": "London bankers at Goldman Sachs have seen their pay pot jump by more than 20% so far this year, as the bank’s surging share price added to the prospect of bumper payouts after bonus caps were lifted in the UK. Filings covering Goldman Sachs International’s (GSI) first-quarter earnings show that it built up a $735m (£580m) pay pool in the three months to March, averaging out at about $218,000 (£170,000) each for its 3,359 staff, the bulk of whom are based in London. That is a 23% jump on the $598m pay pot accumulated during the same period last year, as the value of share-based bonuses – which are paid in Goldman stock – soared. Goldman’s New York-listed shares jumped to $417 by the end of March, compared with $327 a year earlier. They have since climbed to about $461 a share, after a strong period for its trading business pushed profits up 28% in the first quarter. That was despite a 13% drop in first-quarter profits at GSI, which said inflation and geopolitical tensions had been a drag on economic and market activity. Performance over the remaining nine months of the year will determine the final payouts for GSI’s workforce, who are also to benefit from the eradication of a bonus cap that could allow its star performers to earn up to 25 times their annual salary. GSI’s chief executive, Richard Gnodde, announced that the bank would be changing its pay structure in March, months after UK regulators confirmed that they were formally scrapping EU rules that limited bonuses to twice an individual’s base salary. The cap was introduced as part of changes introduced after the 2007-08 banking crash, aimed to stamp out a bonus culture blamed for encouraging short-term profits over longer-term stability. Critics have argued that the decision to scrap the cap could incentivise risky behaviour, given that more of an individual’s pay is riding on performance. But Goldman, which was one of the banks pushing for the reforms, said it would give banks more flexibility to weigh payouts more heavily towards bonuses, rather than fixed salaries. This makes it easier to control the size of total pay packets, depending on performance, as well as defer pay, and also potentially claw back bonuses from bankers when things go wrong, supporters have said. The changes will apply to hundreds of Goldman’s UK staff, known as material risk takers. However, they will not apply to Goldman’s EU-based bankers. Goldman said in a statement in March that “this approach gives us greater flexibility to manage fixed costs through the cycle and pay for performance. It brings the UK closer to the practice in other global financial centres, to support the UK as an attractive venue for talent.” Commenting on the jump in the GSI pay pot, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said that “it is highly ambitious to speculate on year-end compensation based on first-quarter results”. • This article was amended on 27 May 2024 to show that the Goldman Sachs share price was trading at $417 not 417 US cents.",

        "title": "Why travelling on Eurostar from the UK is about to become much trickier",
        "content": "In a land just 20 miles from Britain, people can catch an international train just by buying a ticket and turning up. For Eurostar travellers from London it has never been that simple. But from 6 October, when the EU’s new border regime kicks in, a fresh headache of requirements will apply. There may be some comfort in Eurostar’s promise that it “won’t be a shitshow”. It has spent a year discussing the precise requirements of the EU entry-exit system (EES), and invested €10m in revamping St Pancras International. Here Benugo, an upmarket toastie purveyor, is being ejected from its prime spot to make way for rows of biometric kiosks. Passengers will have to upload their fingerprints and scan their faces, then walk – or queue – past the piano donated by Elton John to the ticket gates. Once they’re through those, the baggage screening and UK passport control, French border police will take their fingerprints all over again. Eurostar says its modelling shows passengers will be able to complete the process within the recommended 60 to 90 minutes before travel, though some reports last week claimed it would take two hours. Eurostar’s chief stations and security officer, Simon Lejeune, said: “We’re confident 6 October won’t be a shitshow because of the work that’s going in … we have the right set-up.” The bar for what is regarded as a “shitshow” in Britain has been raised substantially since the 2016 referendum, but these increasing hurdles will make some travellers wonder if just staying home to watch Emily in Paris or Ratatouille might be easier. For Eurostar, the key is capacity – or how quickly passengers can pass the frontier, and it is installing 49 kiosks in three areas: the other two are for business or premier passengers and an upstairs overflow set-up for when things get hairy at peak times. The double fingerprint check is necessary because biometric data collection must be supervised by a European border officer on first entry. After registration, people will be able to use e-gates for three years. France has agreed to double the police aux frontières booths from nine to 18. Brexit had already cut capacity on trains to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam: the stamping of paper passports was taking so long that trains were not able to fill up and depart on time. Now, Eurostar hopes to cut the last part of the border process from 59 to 37 seconds. The Port of Dover has raised the alarm over how, in a constrained space, arriving car passengers can have all their biometric details taken by EU officials. The CPT, the trade body for coach operators, this week called on ministers for action, warning that EES would “inevitably add to processing time” at the port. Getlink, the Channel tunnel and Shuttle operator, has announced spending of about €70m on measures to avoid a launch-day meltdown. The scheme has been delayed by concerns over back-end computing capabilities and staffing, and the French lobbied hard to put EES back until after the Paris Olympics. For Eurostar, Le Shuttle and the Port of Dover, the French border is “juxtaposed” – physically in Britain – which means checks and queues come before actual travel. Richard Thorp, engineering director at HS1 Ltd, which operates St Pancras station, said: “Everything will be done in London, and when you arrive, you’re free to go. The challenge our airline friends will have is that all that EES process is on arrival.” Airline passengers could find themselves on 6 October at, say, a small Greek airport which has not had millions invested in staff and kiosks to process biometric data. Passport queues for non-EU travellers may not be a pretty sight. Airports remain concerned, not least because final confirmation of the start date is not expected until 28 August, the tail of the summer peak. Olivier Jankovec, director general of airports trade body ACI Europe, says border processing time will rise by up to 50% and adds: “A number of unresolved issues require urgent attention from the European Commission and states.” These include proper testing of the scheme; delays to a promised pre-registration app; and consideration of what border delays could mean. Jankovec says: “More needs to be done to ensure readiness also in terms of passenger awareness.” What ministers call “precautionary flexibility measures” could apply for six months. They include, in Thorp’s words, “mechanisms to maintain a fluid process” – potentially waving people through just on passports if the system keels over. EES will be followed some time in 2025 by the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (Etias), which will require British and other non-EU passengers to pre-register more details and pay €7 before crossing the Channel. Standing by the doomed Benugo with a mocked-up EES kiosk, Thorp and Lejeune concur: “We don’t want to even think about that yet.”",

        "title": "No party has won five elections in a row, and Tories won’t be the first | Larry Elliott",
        "content": "Winning five elections in a row is something no party has managed in modern times, and there are reasons for that. Voters tire of the ruling party and want something new and fresh. Even more importantly, being in power for a long time increases the chances of bad stuff happening that tarnishes the government’s reputation. In the last 50 years, there has been a recession or economic crisis every 10 years or so on average: the mid 1970s, the early 80s, the early 90s, the late 2000s and the early 2020s. The UK’s periodic economic struggles mean that, with hindsight, there have been some elections that were good to lose. It was handy for the Conservatives to be kicked out of office in 1974 because it meant they did not have to clear up the mess they had made of the economy. It was Labour that had to contend with 25% inflation, industrial unrest and the arrival of a team from the International Monetary Fund demanding spending cuts in return for a loan. The Tories then returned to power in 1979 with North Sea oil at their disposal. Likewise, Labour was fortunate to lose in 1992 because, had it not done so, it would have been Neil Kinnock rather than John Major who would have faced the humiliation of the pound being ejected from the European exchange rate mechanism by the relentless attacks of currency speculators. Black Wednesday would have occurred whichever party was in power. But despite some healthy competition, 2019 is in a class of its own as an election worth losing. There was plenty of speculation after Boris Johnson’s decisive victory that Labour was washed up as a political force. Now it is the Conservatives who are facing an existential crisis, with the polls suggesting a defeat worse than 1997. Rishi Sunak faces the usual problems facing the leader of a party that has been in power for a long time: boredom, and the need to defend the government’s record. A much bigger problem, though, is that since 2019 the Conservatives have had to grapple with not one but three massive economic shocks, each one of which has sapped confidence and support for the party. The fact that two of the shocks were not of the government’s making has counted for little. There is some rough justice in this. The Conservatives came to power in 2010 after falsely blaming Gordon Brown’s Labour government for what was clearly a global financial crisis. Now they are getting some of the same treatment, and the result is likely to be the same: an unforgiving electorate booting the government that presided over a crisis (or, in this case, a rolling series of crises) out of office. It was only weeks after the 2019 election that the first case of Covid-19 was detected in the UK. The virus spread rapidly and, in March, Johnson announced a national lockdown that forced all but essential workers to stay at home. Workers who would otherwise have lost their jobs had their wages subsidised by the government through a furlough scheme. There were cash grants, tax holidays, and soft loans to keep businesses afloat. All this came at a price: the loss of tax revenue coupled with higher public spending meant the state borrowed more than £300bn to balance the books in 2020-21. The longer-term consequences – the loss of schooling, the longer NHS waiting lists, the increased incidence of labour market inactivity due to ill-health – were massive and will have an effect for years to come. Throughout this period, a right-of-centre government willingly chose to adopt measures normally associated with parties of the centre left. The workforce was effectively nationalised, macro-economic policy became interventionist, and the Tory desire to balance the books was ditched in favour of borrowing as much as it took to sustain activity. For a while, Sunak was the most Keynesian chancellor of modern times. And – while he was handing out what seemed to be free money – the most popular. The ending of lockdown restrictions brought a different set of problems, not only in the UK but across the global economy. Consumers had built up savings during the worst of the pandemic and wanted to spend them. Demand exceeded supply and bottlenecks resulted. Inflation started to rise and central banks – wary of the risk of pushing economies back into recession – for a while did nothing. Enter Vladimir Putin, who in February 2022 sent Russian troops into Ukraine. The economic impact of the invasion was swift and profound: energy and food prices soared, giving an added twist to already rising inflationary pressures. The government stepped in to subsidise energy bills, but this second external shock helped send inflation to a four-decade high of 11.1%, reduced living standards, put renewed pressure on the public finances and prompted an aggressive tightening of policy from the Bank of England. Interest rates were raised from 0.1% to 5.25% in little more than a year and a half. Johnson’s Downing Street scandals meant he was toppled as prime minister in the summer of 2022 and replaced in early September by Liz Truss. This resulted in the third – but this time self-inflicted – crisis of the period since 2019: the run on sterling and the near-collapse of UK pension funds triggered by Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget. Mortgage rates soared. A degree of stability has returned since Sunak replaced Truss after her 49 days in office, but living standards are lower than they were at the start of the parliament and taxes have risen. The economy is growing again and inflation is only just above the government’s 2% target, but it is all far too little, far too late. There will be no fifth victory.",

        "title": "Huge payouts in prospect for ‘robber barons’ who won bitter battle for GKN",
        "content": "Snow lay thick on the ground in Westminster as demonstrators carrying a large banner reading “Stop the GKN takeover” marched on parliament. It was February 2018, and, inside, Telford MP Lucy Allan was pledging to protect jobs at the historic engineering company, in the face of its hostile takeover by buyout specialist Melrose. Six years on from one of the most acrimonious takeover battles in recent years, old wounds are likely to be reopened this week, when 20 top Melrose executives scoop shares worth more than £300m. The performance plan was created in 2020 and, on Friday, Melrose bosses will learn the exact value of their stock, expected to be about £320m. The staggering sum is the result of motoring share price growth, with more than £4bn added to its value over the four-year period. The payout is likely to add to controversy over executive pay, after bumper deals for bosses including AstraZeneca’s Pascal Soriot and David Schwimmer of the London Stock Exchange. The payout will also mark the end of an era for Melrose, which was set up in 2003 by Jock Miller, David Roper and Simon Peckham – two former accountants and a lawyer respectively. A series of big industrial acquisitions transformed it into a stock market heavyweight. Its motto to “buy, improve, sell” companies – including offloading assets – gave it a reputation as a public company with private-equity instincts. But it was with the GKN deal that Melrose landed squarely on the radar of parliamentarians. GKN was a British engineering stalwart: starting life as an ironworks in south Wales in 1759, it had grown to manufacture helmets and Spitfires during the second world war and later produce components for aerospace companies and serve carmakers, including Jaguar Land Rover. By 2018, it had become a plodding also-ran, with profits under pressure and no boss when Melrose swooped. Melrose’s image as an asset stripper – keen to cut jobs, break up companies and sell them on while taking huge pay deals – riled MPs and unions, who came out to bat for GKN. The Tory MP Robert Halfon described Melrose as “robber baron capitalism at its worst”, while ministers were accused of getting involved too late not doing enough to prevent the takeover. The six years which followed have been partly predictable: there have been factory closures, job cuts, huge executive pay packets and a demerger of the GKN automotive, hydrogen and powder metallurgy businesses. Shares in Dowlais, the car parts business created by the demerger, have slumped 40% since listing a year ago. Melrose has also surprised critics, however, by revamping its business model and even changing its mantra, to “design, deliver, improve”. GKN has not been gutted, and Melrose refocused to become a specialist aerospace company centred on it, with operations in the US, UK, Sweden and the Netherlands. It boasts high-end work, including on the F-35 fighter jet programme. Despite taking a hit from Covid’s grounding of airlines and the woes at Boeing, it appears to be a business on the front foot – notching up profits of £390m on £3.4bn of revenue in 2023. It is now valued at £8.1bn, even outstripping the value of GKN when it was a larger group at the time of the takeover. As a result, executives will share in a payout that equates to £16m each, but which will skew towards larger gains for the most senior bosses. Peckham, meanwhile, was the final of the founding trio to step down, in March, and launched a new dealmaking venture, Melvest. He told the Sunday Times the bumper award represented a “good payout”, but shareholders had received far more. “You could take a view that no one should earn more than this or that, but I would say that’s capitalism working,” he said. Andrew Speke at the High Pay Centre says: “The £300m-plus Melrose is paying out to its executives is reflective of the wider issues of executive pay in the UK. “Companies paying very high amounts to a larger number of senior employees, while paying many of their workers very modest salaries, shows the potential companies have to raise the pay of the workers, were they to realign their priorities.”",

        "title": "Once Britain is back in the EU, things can only get better | William Keegan",
        "content": "‘Things can only get better” was a Labour party slogan before the 1997 general election. The reason why Rishi Sunak has surprised the nation, and what my old colleague Alan Watkins used to call the “chattering classes”, by calling for a snap election is that Sunak and his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, have apparently decided that things can only get worse. With low inflation figures – at last – and the possibility of a cut in interest rates, the two of them have been talking the economy up as though there were no tomorrow. Unfortunately for them, and indeed for the rest of us, unless the thrust of economic policy changes, there is an unhappy tomorrow, as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have reminded us. Under current fiscal rules, the prospect is of more savage cuts in spending on essential services, or serious increases in taxes. (On a lighter note, I can’t resist reporting that the racehorse Fiscal Rules has not been doing too well in Ireland recently.) Yet this is a time when you have only to look out of the window to see that the nation’s infrastructure is in pretty poor shape, and that the grim signs of poverty are not far away. I need hardly mention the funds needed to reduce the pressure on the NHS and make our rivers and water supply safe from the neglect perpetrated by the privatised water companies. As Lord Kinnock ruefully observed in a recent press interview, the British “invented clean water” in the 19th century. Kinnock thinks Labour will win, but warns against complacency. After all, for much of the approach to the 1992 election, Labour under his leadership were ahead in the polls – with odds of 6-1 on, on the day before the election – yet they lost. The Conservatives, and their captive press, made much of “Labour’s tax bombshell” in that campaign. In fact, the increases promised by the shadow chancellor, John Smith, were an honest attempt to demonstrate fiscal responsibility by demonstrating that some worthy increases in public spending would be paid for. That Tory success with the “tax bombshell” has scarred Labour’s approach to elections ever since. The general economic picture now ought to be a gift to Labour. They can campaign about 14 wasted Tory years – five years of austerity under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition of 2010-15 and nine under the foolhardy Brexit referendum and its consequences. The fact is that Starmer was right about Brexit and Boris Johnson and his partners in this historic political disaster were wrong. Now, in his mistaken desire to appease those Labour voters who were misled by pro-Brexit propaganda – thereby disappointing, even alienating, his natural supporters – Starmer has ruled out returning to the customs union and the single market; but he believes the answer to a prospective Labour government’s problems lies in “growth”. We have reached the reductio ad absurdum where, when asked on the BBC “would membership of the single market boost economic growth?”, Starmer replied “no”. As even the Conservative peer and Times columnist Daniel Finkelstein commented, “[it] isn’t true and he doesn’t believe it either”. My old friend Lord Heseltine has warned that this is going to be a most dishonest election campaign, with both major parties “trying to avoid the key issue underlying our economic malaise – Brexit”. Starmer has a big opportunity here. He will know that decisions made right at the beginning of a new parliament matter hugely. Harold Wilson is one of his heroes. Wilson’s mistake was to rule out a necessary devaluation of the pound when he was elected in 1964. This error blighted his premiership, leading to forced deflationary measures and the ultimate humiliation of a market-induced devaluation in 1967. If Starmer wins, he would have the opportunity to announce the beginning of an approach to a return to the customs union and single market, which, along with a more sensible long-term approach to fiscal rules, would give him a fair chance of boosting the now-deflated animal spirits of entrepreneurs. I have spoken to operators in the financial markets who believe such a step would indeed be good for confidence and, yes, growth. A more long-term approach to the fiscal problem would be essential for Labour to achieve a growth-oriented investment programme. The idea would be to build up much-needed public sector investment, which would also encourage private sector investment. As for the current restrictive fiscal rules, no less an authority than the former top Treasury official, Lord Macpherson, revealed in the Financial Times last Friday: “I always advised chancellors not to become mesmerised by such rules. They come and go.”",

        "title": "Jeff Dodds: the Formula E boss planning a move into pole position",
        "content": "Jeff Dodds has been a fan of Formula One “all my life”, he says. That is probably a good thing because, as chief executive of electric racing series Formula E, he must find the comparison with its fossil-fuelled cousin is constant. So he takes it head-on. Such is the growth and improvement in technology in Formula E that one day, he says, it is “realistic that a question will be asked about whether both can exist together”. Talking to the Observer in the race company’s west London headquarters, he adds that maybe one day, as Formula E develops, “they won’t [both exist]”. Formula One fans’ scepticism can be forgiven. The petrol-powered series claims 1.5 billion TV viewers and several hundred thousand spectators at every race (including 480,000 at Silverstone, the home of UK motorsport). Formula E claims 225 million TV viewers, attendances in the tens of thousands, and barely any coverage from traditional western media. Yet Formula E has technology – and maybe also geography – on its side. The global shift to electric vehicles appears inevitable, and the transition is led by Asia, and particularly China, where more and more fans are embracing electric motorsport. Thousands have flocked to this weekend’s Shanghai ePrix. Dodds has led the business for the past year. Sitting in Formula E’s offices wearing a race-style tracksuit emblazoned with sponsor logos, he exudes the forceful charm of a man accustomed to pressing race-paddock flesh – and persuading the world that they should want to be there too. The electric racing series is now in its 10th season, having started in 2014 in Beijing. It was the brainchild of Alejandro Agag, a Spanish businessman, and Frenchman Jean Todt, who was then president of the FIA (Fédération International de l’Automobile), which governs global motorsport. From the start, Agag and Todt emphasised the low-carbon credentials of the race, even claiming that it was carbon neutral – albeit thanks to controversial offsets. Dodds says sustainability is “part of our DNA”, but there is plenty of evidence that green credentials don’t matter that much to motorsport fans of any kind. Formula E itself has a Saudi sponsorship deal, and held a race weekend in Riyadh this year. There were teething problems with Formula E. Teams in the first series had to swap cars mid-race because their batteries could not last the course. But electric cars have come a long way since, with lighter and longer-lasting batteries. A new generation of cars will be able to go from 0-60mph in 1.8 seconds, out-accelerating Formula 1, and have a top speed of 200mph. As the tech improved, the series attracted audiences and investors: media companies Liberty Global (the owner behind F1’s recent boom, driven by the hugely popular Netflix series Drive to Survive) and Warner Bros Discovery bought in in 2015. Dodds is tasked with growing Formula E (after a hiatus during the coronavirus pandemic). But his recent jobs – as chief executive of Dutch telecoms company Tele2 and then chief operating officer of Virgin Media O2 – would not appear to make him an obvious choice to lead a motorsport series. However, go back a bit further and the appointment makes more sense. Dodds was born in Kent to what he calls a “very working-class family” – his mother was a nurse and his father a firefighter. He was “fascinated with cars from a very early age”, and chose jobs in the car industry when he left school, working in sales and marketing for Volvo and later Honda. He says he caught the motorsport bug at the Japanese company, which at the time raced Formula One cars, motorbikes and powerboats. “I think at some point they even raced on lawn mowers.” A set of Phil Mickelson’s clubs in his office is evidence of a stint at US golf equipment maker Callaway, but he soon moved on to telecoms, eventually leading 17,000 people at Virgin Media O2. Liberty Global had bought Virgin Media in 2013, and when Dodds told chief executive Mike Fries that he wanted to leave telecoms, the American told him to “just hang around the hoop for a bit” – a basketball metaphor. The Formula E ball has now dropped to Dodds, with Liberty and Warner happy to bear steep losses – €242m across 2021 and 2022, according to its latest UK accounts – in pursuit of growth. He acknowledges that “not enough people know about us”, but says Formula E now has 385 million fans, while F1 has 800 million by the same survey methodology. “Across Japan, China, Indonesia, we see an incredible growth in fanbase,” he says. Making headway in Europe and the US is more of a struggle: German makers Audi and BMW both pulled out in 2021. “Before my time,” Dodds says hurriedly, suggesting it may have been because of questions over the pace of the manufacturers’ transition to electric cars. Formula E now has 11 teams, including Jaguar and McLaren from the UK, Japan’s Nissan, Germany’s Porsche and Chinese battery maker Envision. A final grid slot is up for sale. Dodds says he would consider German “rejoiners”, and drops the name of Fred Vasseur, Ferrari’s F1 team principal, with a studied casualness that suggests the company is not interested. But he is particularly courting other Chinese manufacturers. His pitch: eyeballs around the world at a fraction of the cost of Formula One. Buying a Formula One team could cost well north of $1bn, with an annual cost cap of $140m before drivers’ salaries. Formula E’s cost cap is $14m, and a team might cost between $25m and $30m. Costs are lower because most elements of the racing cars – from chassis to batteries – are identical, and research is focused on the motors and the software that controls them. That upsets some racing purists, who value the battle between constructors, but it avoids Formula One’s “Max Verstappen problem” – the dominance of the Red Bull team. Races are usually held in city centres, which play to the cars’ strengths of impressive acceleration and relatively low noise. This will change as the series looks for bigger circuits to match the batteries’ longer ranges. Dodds says Formula E could start alternating 40-minute top-speed dashes with longer-range tactical battles. He and Formula E face a tough job winning over diehard petrolheads. But as the world’s automotive centre of gravity shifts to Asia and electric cars become the global norm, he may find he doesn’t need to. CV Age 50 Family Married to Mary. Two sons and two cats.

        "title": "‘People tell me they’re not ready to work’: how long-term sickness blighted a town",
        "content": "On a Wednesday night in Hastings, a handful of under-18s gather in the back of a former newspaper building for a weekly Dungeons and Dragons night. Around the table, a teenager peers from behind a floppy fringe, telling the other players of a monster with jaws wide enough to swallow a man whole. Behind him, two boys are playing pool. For the moment, there’s not an iPhone in sight. Sidney Ewing, the youth worker overseeing the programme, says the majority of young people who come to the centre feel uncertain about their future. Their most popular night is for 16-to-18s, she says, a generation who lost two critical years of their education to Covid, with only screens for school and socialising. “A lot of them say they aren’t ready to go to university or start work because of their mental health,” she says. “You hear that a lot: ‘I need to sort myself out first.’” Britain is suffering from an epidemic of people too ill to work. Economic inactivity due to ill health has been increasing for five years in the longest sustained rise since the 1990s, and now stands at a record high of 2.8 million. Addressing this will be one of the biggest challenges for the next government and a central economic question for parties on the election campaign trail. There are now 700,000 more people unable to work through illness than before Covid. Nine-tenths of that rise can be accounted for by two groups: the oldest in the labour market, and the very young. In Hastings, one in 10 young people leave school with no plans for higher education or work – almost twice the English average. The town has the joint highest number of people aged 16 to 34 who say they are in bad health, according to the 2021 census. In terms of opportunities for young people, Hastings has more in common with Blackpool than regional neighbours such as Brighton or Tunbridge Wells. “The centre of Hastings has some of the highest levels of crime in the county, the local schools are constantly changing, and the biggest employer is the care industry. It forms this perfect storm for young people,” says Matt Davey, the founder of a local community interest company called Head on Board, which uses skateboarding as a way in to talking about mental health and suicide. In 2019, East Sussex county council shut 13 youth clubs and 14 children’s centres, a pattern that has been repeated across the country. Local authorities, under pressure from austerity, slashed youth provision funding in England from more than £1bn to £408.5m between 2011 and 2021. Davey was a council youth worker in Hastings for more than a decade, and saw firsthand the impact of the cuts. Once a young person starts to feel isolated, it can create a vicious cycle, he says: “There are common factors that keep us well and healthy: being connected to people, having a purpose. There is definitely a link between doing something, be that volunteering, part-time employment or training, and good mental health.” Like many seaside towns, Hastings suffers from a lack of high-quality jobs. A quarter of residents are employed in health and social care. Much of the work in hospitality is seasonal and insecure. But a growing number of tech enterprises are creating new opportunities. The Hastings youth club, helped by a two-year grant from the Youth Investment Fund to create permanent spaces for young people, is currently run from the offices of OBX, a digital arts hub that is part of Hastings Commons – an ecosystem of community-led organisations working together to renovate derelict buildings in the town centre. Around the board games and the pool table are banks of computers, a digital scanner and a 3D printer. A tiny gecko made of chocolate has been freshly 3D-printed as part of an experiment by Alex Giles. He was two years into a diploma in games development at college when the pandemic hit. With no computer at home, Giles was forced to abandon his studies. For the next two years he was on universal credit, struggling to find work, save for a job packing boxes in a local warehouse one Christmas. Then he was offered a job at Hastings Commons under the government’s post-Covid Kickstart scheme, which provided funds to create employment for 16- to 24-year-olds on universal credit who were at risk of long-term unemployment. “Kickstart put me back on track,” Giles says. “Before that, I was in a state of uncertainty. I wanted to find employment but I didn’t know where to start.” At 22, Giles is now employed by OBX and experimenting with printed food for a project exploring food poverty. He supports others who come through the building on work experience or for workshops. Many of them say they would like his job. Meanwhile, Hastings Commons has created its own version of Kickstart to replace the axed government scheme. In the 1990s, the long-term impact of job losses after rapid deindustrialisation was not persistent unemployment, but instead higher rates of economic inactivity due to long-term sickness, according to the Resolution Foundation. The thinktank says the long-term sick are now disproportionately concentrated in post-industrial and coastal areas of the country as the “hidden unemployed”, challenging the narrative of government statistics that the country is operating at close to full employment. Among working-age adults in England and Wales, new claims for the personal independence payment (Pip) have increased by two-thirds (68%) between early 2020 and early 2024. In Hastings, 6,728 people are claiming Pip for an illness, disability or mental health condition, up 52% since January 2020. The figures will be a source of alarm for politicians. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, spending on disability benefits is set to rise by 49% in nominal terms between 2023-24 and 2028-29. In the Hastings Commons boardroom, social media assistant Sharon Rhodes is remembering the success of a recent campaign. “I made a local historian go viral on TikTok!” she says. With her cropped grey hair and denim jacket, Rhodes is a youthful 50, putting her in the second category –older working-age adults increasingly out of work because of illness. She was diagnosed with rapid-cycle bipolar disorder and PTSD more than 20 years ago and spent 10 years out of work before she found the courage to apply for the government’s access to work scheme. This pays for a designated worker to make sure she is eating and sleeping – basic activities that still sometimes feel insurmountable. Alongside flexible hours, Hastings Commons provides staff training in mental health awareness. Crucially, Rhodes’s 10 hours of work do not interfere with benefits; she receives employment and support allowance alongside income support. But she says many people in Hastings are terrified to work for fear that they might lose their benefits. That culture of fear could get worse. In his autumn statement last November, Jeremy Hunt announced changes to disability benefits to make it tougher for some people with poor mobility or mental health issues to receive additional support. That could make it harder, not easier, for some people to work. Labour has promised to improve mental health services and reduce NHS waiting lists if it gets into power. A swing of 3.4%, or 3,500 votes, is all it would take to topple the current Conservative MP in Hastings and Rye, Sally-Ann Hart. Rhodes argues she is able to work because of her benefits payments, not despite them – and because she found the right job. “I want to show the country you can work with such a bad diagnosis if you find the right employer,” she says. • This article was amended on 26 May 2024 because a picture caption on an earlier version said it showed Hastings “town centre” whereas it showed a street in Hastings Old Town.",

        "title": "Royal Mail owner warns Czech billionaire’s offer could create risk around finances",
        "content": "Royal Mail’s owner has warned that a potential £3.5bn bid by the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský could create risk around the company’s finances. The warning came as the industry regulator Ofcom announced that it had opened an investigation into the parent group, International Distributions Services (IDS), for failing to meet its annual delivery targets for the second year in a row. Last year, Ofcom fined the company £5.6m for failing to meet its first-class and second-class delivery targets in 2022-23. The warning over the revised offer by Křetínský’s EP Group, which IDS has said it is “minded” to accept, was issued in delayed annual results released on Friday afternoon. The company had apologised on Thursday for failing to release its results at 7am as scheduled, because of auditor delays. The IDS board said Royal Mail had “adequate resources” to continue operating for at least 12 months, but its long-term prospects hinged on whether the new owners would be able to maintain existing loans and secure fresh funding. “The extent of the uncertainty related to whether existing finance will be recalled following a change in control, together with a lack of visibility or control over the availability of funding following a change in control,” IDS said. The report said this created “material uncertainty” and “may cast significant doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and that it may therefore be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business”. IDS reported that the company had swung to a £26m operating profit in the year to March, up from a £742m loss a year earlier. IDS benefited from better performance by its Royal Mail division, where price hikes and an increase in parcel deliveries helped narrow its losses to £254m, compared with a bumper £1bn loss in the previous 12 months. EP Group has until 29 May to formally submit its £3.5bn bid, improved from an earlier £3.1bn offer that IDS had said “significantly undervalues” the company, or walk away from a takeover for six months. Křetínský’s takeover interest comes against the backdrop of potential changes to the postal industry. Earlier this year, Ofcom laid out possible options for the future of the universal service obligation (USO), which mandates Royal Mail to deliver nationwide, six days a week, at a fixed price. In response, Royal Mail has suggested it could pare back its second-class service to every other weekday to save money. However, it has committed to delivering first-class letters six days a week – a promise that EP plans to honour, IDS has said. EP is expected to present a series of undertakings to the government, including pledges not to make compulsory redundancies or split up the group, which also includes the international parcels arm GLS. Last week, IDS bosses met the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, to discuss the bid and changes to the USO. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has said any takeover bid for IDS would face a “normal” security review, but the government is not in principle opposed to EP’s bid. Under the terms of the proposed Křetínský deal, the takeover would hand a windfall to the thousands of postal workers who have retained the shares they were given when Royal Mail was privatised in 2013. Shareholders will also be given a special dividend if the takeover is completed, worth £76m. • This article was amended on 24 May 2024 to clarify the risk assessment in IDS’s report.",

        "title": "Co-op bank brand may disappear within years in Coventry Building Society deal",
        "content": "The Co-operative Bank brand is on track to disappear from UK high streets, after Coventry Building Society confirmed it would acquire the bank from its hedge-fund owners in a £780m deal. The deal was finalised after Coventry said it made a non-binding cash offer for the bank last month that will create a lender with almost 5 million customers and an £89bn balance sheet, and return the bank to its mutual roots. While the new owner will keep the Co-operative Bank name throughout the integration period – which is likely to last “several years” – it has left the door open to dropping the brand long-term. The move would dissociate the enlarged group from a series of scandals including an accounting blunder that left a £1.5bn black hole in its finances in 2013, and forced it to separate from the Co-operative Group and into new hedge-fund ownership. Its reputation also suffered when the bank’s former chair Paul Flowers, a former Labour councillor and Methodist church minister nicknamed the “Crystal Methodist”, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine in 2014. Coventry declined to comment on long-term plans for the brand, referring only to a published statement, which said the banks would “continue to operate under their current names and branding while we carry out the work needed to provide a joined-up service. We expect this to take several years.” The building society also declined to comment on whether the Co-operative Bank’s ethical commitments would be maintained after the takeover. However, a spokesperson stressed that Coventry had obtained B Corp certification in 2023, which is meant to signal that a company upholds high standards in its dealings with staff, the community, customers and the environment. The Co-operative Bank had only been allowed to continue using the Co-op name, despite being majority-owned by hedge funds, because it built an ethical policy into its articles of association. Use of the Co-op name is governed by regulation and overseen by the government and the Co-operatives UK body. These parties keep its right to the name under review and could withdraw it at any time. Coventry, which is the UK’s second largest building society by group assets, said it remained committed to mutuality and the deal would allow the newly combined lender to increase its share of the mortgage market as well as give it a position in the current account and business banking markets. The Co-operative Bank, which has 2.5 million retail customers and 94,000 small business customers, will become a subsidiary of Coventry Building Society, marking a return to its mutual roots. The ethical lender, which was founded in 1872, traces its origins back to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, the body that would become the Co-operative Group, which provided financial services to the wider co-operative member-owned movement in Britain. Coventry said it did not need to seek a member vote for the deal under the Building Societies Act 1986. The structure of the Co-operative deal means that up to £125m will be deferred for a period of three years from completion, subject to future performance, and the transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025, with integration taking place over several years. The deal is part of a wave of consolidation among the banking sector this year, including Nationwide, the largest building society, which has agreed a £2.9bn takeover of Virgin Money. Nationwide also decided not to give its members a vote on the Virgin Money takeover. During the integration period, Coventry and the Co-operative will retain their banking licences and will be headed by David Thorburn as chair and Steve Hughes as chief executive. Thorburn, the chair of Coventry Building Society, called the deal a “transformational moment” for both organisations that would create a “stronger mutual business”. Nick Slape, the chief executive of Co-operative Bank Holdings, said it was a “natural next step”.",

        "title": "Retail sales tumble across Britain amid cost of living squeeze and wet weather; energy price cap falls 7% – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up…. A month of unrelenting rain in many parts of the country resulted in British shoppers spending much less than expected in April, with fewer treating themselves to clothes and big-ticket items. The Office for National Statistics blamed the wet weather for the 2.3% decrease in the amount of goods bought, compared with March, which was much steeper than the 0.4% decline forecast by analysts. Furniture, clothing, sports equipment, and games and toy shops experienced the biggest monthly sales drops, with non-food store sales falling 4.1%, the joint largest drop since January 2021. Retailers blamed low footfall amid bad weather, the high cost of living despite a decline in the annual pace of inflation to 2.3%, and high fuel prices. Petrol sales dropped at their fastest rate since October 2021, while food stores sales volumes fell for the third month in a row. The energy price cap in Great Britain will fall 7% to the equivalent of £1,568 a year this summer after a drop in wholesale gas prices. Set by the energy regulator Ofgem, the cap reflects the average annual dual-fuel bill for 29m households and takes effect from July until the end of September. Set quarterly, the cap will fall by £122 in July from its current level of £1,690, about £500 less than the cap a year earlier, easing the pressure on household finances. However, the cap is more than £400 more than it was three years ago, before the energy crisis. The energy security secretary, Claire Coutinho, seized on the fall in the price cap as evidence that the pressure on household spending was easing in the run-up to the general election. She also claimed that Labour’s plans for a state-owned Great British Energy company, focusing on renewables, would “hike your bills and raise your taxes”. Elsewhere….here’s the economic data to watch out for over the coming weeks: UK drivers have been warned to expect one of the busiest bank holiday weekends on the roads in years, with more than 20m leisure journeys forecast over the next four days. Elon Musk has criticised US government tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, describing the levies as “not good” and a distortion of the car market. The Co-operative Bank brand is on track to disappear from UK high streets, after Coventry Building Society confirmed it would acquire the bank from its hedge-fund owners in a £780m deal. A woman accused of converting bitcoin into cash and property to help hide the proceeds of a £5bn fraud was jailed for nearly seven years on Friday for money laundering after a trial in a London court, Reuters reports. Prosecutors said Wen Jian helped hide the source of money allegedly stolen from nearly 130,000 Chinese investors in fraudulent wealth schemes between 2014 and 2017. She was not alleged to have been involved in the underlying fraud, which prosecutors said was masterminded by another woman who Wen believed was independently wealthy. As part of their investigation, British police seized wallets holding more than 61,000 bitcoin – making it one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures by law enforcement worldwide. The 61,000 bitcoin was worth around £1.4bn when police gained access in 2021, prosecutors said during Wen’s trial. It is now worth over £3bn. Wen, 42, denied three counts of money laundering and said she did not have any knowledge of criminality linked to the bitcoin. She was found guilty by jurors of one count in March following a trial at Southwark Crown Court. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on two other counts. Wen was sentenced on Friday to six years and eight months in prison for the single count of money laundering of which she was found guilty. Consumer confidence in the US has dropped, as Americans fret about rising unemployment and slowing wages. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, just released, has fallen to 69.1 this month, down on April’s 77.2. That’s higher than expected, though, with Americans also less concerned about inflation than last month. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu explains: Consumer sentiment fell back about 10% this May following three consecutive months of very little change. This 8.1 index-point decrease is statistically significant and brings sentiment to its lowest reading in about five months. The year-ahead outlook for business conditions saw a particularly notable decline, while views about personal finances were little changed. Consumers expressed particular concern over labor markets; they expect unemployment rates to rise and income growth to slow. The prospect of continued high interest rates also weighed down consumer views. These deteriorating expectations suggest that multiple factors pose downside risk for consumer spending. Still, sentiment remains almost 20% above a year ago and about 40% above the all-time historic low in June 2022, reflecting how much consumer views have improved as inflation eased. I mentioned in the introduction that economic data – always interesting, often important! – becomes even more notable during an election. And over the next six weeks, inflatiom, unemployment, GDP, retail sales and public finances figures will all be in the spotlight. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Rishi Sunak’s slim chance of pulling off a victory against the odds in July’s general election depends on voters buying the argument that tough decisions taken since he became prime minister are paying off. That claim will be tested over the next six weeks – with every piece of economic news more closely scrutinised than usual for evidence that the UK’s tentative economic recovery is gaining momentum or has started to falter. Here’s the details: Stock markets are ending the week on a slightly subdued note. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average share index has opened 18 points higher, or +0.05%, at 39,083 points, a day after its biggest drop of 2024. In London, the FTSE 100 is down 22 points (-0.3%) at 8317, sliding away from the record highs we saw earlier this month. Investors are anxious, as the likely date for the first cut to US interest rates has pushed towards the end of the year. Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, explains: The hawkish commentary by Fed officials on Tuesday was underscored by the FOMC minutes on Wednesday. But topping it all up on Thursday were better-than-expected flash PMIs that pointed to a pickup in both business activity and prices in May. The composite PMI, covering both manufacturing and services, was the strongest in two years. The most worrying aspect of the S&amp;P Global survey was the acceleration in input and output costs, with only employment registering some weakness. The data strengthened the case for ‘higher for longer’, with the Atlanta Fed’s Bostic signalling on Thursday that a rate cut may have to be delayed until the last three months of the year. It’s a similar story for UK interest rates, where the first cut may not come until November – after inflation fell less than hoped in April. Today’s retail sales report shows shoppers are still apprehensive, reports Oliver Vernon-Harcourt, head of retail at Deloitte: “April’s retail sales were more disappointing than expected, once again being dampened by wet weather, deterring shoppers from the high street and impacting the sale of seasonal items. “Though consumer confidence continues to rise, many remain apprehensive and are not yet loosening their purse strings, especially on non-essential items and goods such as clothing and footwear. “Consumers are focused on value, with the likes of own-label food remaining resilient. “Overall, this is a clear sign that, despite inflation easing, retailers’ road to recovery will require them to continue to invest into product ranges that target consumers of all budgets.” Speaking of the US economy, do you know how GDP, employment levels, food and petrol prices or the stock market have fared under Joe Biden? Well, you can test your knowledge with a rather fun interactive quiz here. Good luck. I did quite well on the workforce question, but generally my trendline wasn’t as close as the median Guardian reader (still, they’re a bright lot!). Over in the US, sales of durable goods have risen unexpectedly, showing the resilience of the American economy. New orders for manufactured durable goods in April increased by $1.9bn or 0.7% to $284.1 billion, the U.S. Census Bureau announced today. This is the third consecutive monthly rise in a row, and better than the 0.8% fall which economists predicted. March’s data has been revised down, though, to a 0.8% gain not the 2.6% bounce first recorded. The Census Bureau adds: Excluding transportation, new orders increased 0.4 percent. Excluding defense, new orders were virtually unchanged. Transportation equipment, also up three consecutive months, led the increase, $1.1 billion or 1.2 percent to $96.2 billion. An eagerly awaited review of pricing in the UK water industry has been delayed by the general election. Regulator Ofwat has announced that it has postponed the publication of its draft price control determinations for the water sector until Thursday 11 July. They had been scheduled for June, but this delay will now push the announcement beyond the general election on 4th July. Ofwat says it is acting in line with the general election guidance for civil servants – during the pre-election purdah period, ministers, civil servants, and local authorities must exercise caution in making announcements or decisions that might affect the campaign. Ofwat sets prices in the water industry every five years – the 2024 price review will come into effect on 1 April 2025. Water companies are pushing for steep increases in bills, saying they need extra cash to tackle the UK’s sewage crisis and the climate emergency. The future of Britain’s biggest water firm Thames Water, which wants to increase bills by 40%, could hinge on the decision. Talks between Thames Water Ltd.’s parent company and its creditors are effectively frozen after UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a general election this week, Bloomberg reported yesterday. Finance ministers and central bankers from across the G7 are gathered in Stresa, northern Italy, today to discuss issues such as support for Ukraine and how to react to China’s industrial policies. The G7 are expected to discuss America’s push for a loan to Ukraine backed by the future income from some $300bn of frozen Russian assets. But officials involved in the negotiations are sounding cautious about a breakthough today, saying there are legal and technical aspects to be hammered out For the UK, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey and Britain’s Treasury Director General, International Finance Lindsay Whyte attended today’s “family photo”: Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of Eurasia Group, predicts G7 finance ministers will make progress on some legal and practical issues around leveraging frozen Russian assets at their meeting, but not make a final breakthrough. Rahman writes: The political decision will be left to G7 leaders at their summit on 13-15 June. Despite persistent European concerns, newfound political momentum behind leveraging frozen Russian assets to support more financing for Ukraine makes a political agreement next month and implementation this year the basecase (now a 55% probability, compared to 40% previously). In France, climate activists have been protesting against oil giant TotalEnergies today. Reuters has the details: Climate activists climbed up a building near TotalEnergies’ Paris headquarters on Friday to protest the oil major’s climate strategy while others stormed the offices of Total investor Amundi, denouncing its holding in the group. The actions came ahead of annual general meetings being held at both companies on Friday, as climate groups condemn ongoing investment in oil and gas production. Barriers had already been erected around the entrances of Total’s offices in the French capital’s La Defense business district on Thursday evening, with employees told to work from home on Friday. The Co-operative Bank is to return to its mutual roots after Coventry Building Society confirmed that it will acquire the bank from its hedge fund owners for £780m. The deal has now been finalised after Coventry said it had made a non-binding cash offer for the bank last month that will create a lender with almost 5 million customers and an £89bn balance sheet. Coventry, which is the UK’s second largest building society by group assets, said it remained committed to mutuality and the deal would allow the newly combined lender to increase its share of the mortgage market as well as give it a position in the current account and business banking markets. The Co-operative Bank, which has 2.5 million retail customers and 94,000 small business customers, will become a subsidiary of Coventry Building Society, marking a return to its mutual roots. Britain’s expecially wet 2024 has hurt the retail sector, reports Rob Wood, chief UK economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics. Wood points out that the past three months have seen “relentlessly bad weather, with rainfall 55% above average in February, 20% in March and 68% in April”. But he said hopes of rainfall returning to more seasonal norms should mean the high street sees “less disruption”, and that wage growth and falling inflation should boost consumer spending. Wood adds: “With households already saving a larger fraction of their incomes than usual and reporting in ONS surveys that they have rebuilt their rainy day savings, we expect further increases in disposable income to feed through strongly to overall spending.” Today’s retail sales reports shows that consumers bought 5% less stuff (retail sales volumes) last month than in April 2019. But they spent almost 15% more, with inflation meaning people spent more but got less, as this chart shows: Neil Wilson of Markets.com says: Ah the weather. Yes it’s been terrible. No, you cannot really blame it for crappy retail sales. Also may I point out that whilst the value of retail sales has gone up this is entirely due to inflation – volumes have been declining since 2021 and are below pre-Covid levels. Sterling dipped a bit on the news to trade back below $1.27. April’s slump in retail spending shows “cost of living pressures” are far from over, says TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak: “We need people to be able to spend in their local economies to boost growth and businesses. That’s the only way we’ll be able to achieve a sustainable recovery. “But today’s slump in retail sales shows that families are still struggling with the cost of living crisis – with millions having to cut back. “The huge pressure on household budgets is far from over. A toxic combination of soaring prices – and 14 years of flatlining wages – has shredded incomes. “The Conservatives can brag all they like about their plan working. But the British public are not fools. “Many bills are still going up and real wages are still worth less than in 2008.” The drop in UK retail sales in April shows that high interest rates are hurting consumers, says businessman Hugh Osmond, founder of Punch Taverns. Osmond warns that interest rates, currently 5.25%, are too high, posting on X: The Bank of England are blind to real world data. Obviously poor weather was a big factor but online sales fell sharply too. This retail sales fall is totally consistent with the unexpectedly (unexpected by BoE that is) huge rise in personal savings rates suggesting that high interest rates are now having an excessive effect. 3%-4% is the right range and the longer they wait, the more they will then overshoot on the downside. The cost of living remains a major issue for the public, the latest Public opinions and social trends survey shows. This month’s poll, just releaed, found that 55% of adults reported their cost of living had increased over the last month, while 42% said their cost of living had remained the same and 3% said it had decreased. The most commonly reported cause of rising costs were food shopping (94%), fuel (61%), and gas and electricity bills (53%). Surprise news in the City this morning: Stephen Bird, the chief executive of asset manager Abrdn, is stepping down. Bird’s tenure at Abrdn, former by the merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management, was punctuated by a rebranding that saw the company shed most of its vowels, and attract plenty of derision. The company has been hit by outflows, which reached £13.9bn in 2023, prompting it to cut 500 jobs. Reuters says Bird’s four-year tenure was “turbulent….marked by deep outflows of client cash and a controversial rebrand.” And today, Abrdn announces it is “beginning the process of moving to fresh leadership”, with CFO Jason Windsor being appointed as interim group CEO while a new permament replacement CEO is found. Abrdn says its board and Bird have “together agreed” that it is the right time for him to “hand over the reins” to his team. Abdrn’s chairman, Sir Douglas Flint, says: He joined us as the pandemic took hold and, despite the restrictions this imposed, spearheaded a fundamental reshaping of the company, leading from the front to create a company that can be competitive in a fast-evolving sector. Adapting the inherited business model to be capable of generating sustainable and profitable growth required strategic vision, intense hard work and the courage to make tough but necessary decisions. While this was underway, Stephen took time to assemble the talent needed to execute successfully on his strategic vision and he passes on to them, with confidence, the responsibility to execute the next stage of our transformation. Bird’s 12 month notice period begins today, although he’ll work alongside Windsor until the end of June before beginning six month’s gardening leave in July. As “a good leaver”, he’ll remain eliglble for various bonuses. Energy prices are an early general election football, with all sides trying to please the crowd. Claire Coutinho MP, energy secretary, has announced that the energy price cap would be retained in every year of the next parliament, if the Conservatives win July’s election. The Conservatives are also pledging to make it easier for households to compare energy prices, and switch at the right time to benefit from lower tariffs. Coutinho also claims the government’s “bold action” has brought energy bills down – though the 7% drop coming in July was actually due to falling wholesale prices in the energy markets. Coutinho says: “Labour does not have a serious approach to Britain’s energy security and they aren’t honest about the costs that their reckless net zero targets would place on households. “Thanks to our bold action, energy bills are at their lowest in two years, now we’re telling suppliers to put consumers first and bring real competition back to the market - cutting bills further and improving customer service. “Only the Conservatives have a clear plan for a secure future where we reach net zero without punishing families with extra costs.” Labour’s plan is based around creating a publicly-owned green electricity generator, called Great British Energy, which Sir Kier Starmer says will cut bills and boost energy security. Starmer says: “Families are picking up the tab of 14 years of Tory energy failure and are expected to remain a staggering £400 a year worse off under the new price cap.” “Labour will stop families paying over the odds for energy. Great British Energy, our new publicly-owned energy company, will invest in homegrown clean energy to boost energy independence and cut bills for good.” Sir Ed Davey said the Liberal Democrats would slash energy bills by investing in home insulation and boosting renewables. “Energy bills remain far higher than five years ago, on top of sky-high mortgages and rents and prices in the shops. “Families and pensioners are feeling worse off after years of Conservative chaos. “Liberal Democrats would slash energy bills by investing in insulating people’s homes and boosting renewables – the cheapest, cleanest and most popular form of energy.” Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer argrees that insulation, rather than “fiddling with the price cap”, is the answer to getting energy bills down: “A mass programme of government-backed, council delivered home insulation starting immediately after the General Election is a win-win solution for people and the planet and offers people hope and positive change. “We could reduce bills for the long term and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by building new homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and boosting insulation in existing homes. Insulating people’s homes means they can stay warm while using less energy, save money and produce fewer harmful carbon emissions.” Despite this summer’s welcome cut to the energy price cap (see here), a typical annual household energy bill is expected to be 60 per cent (or £670) higher this year than in 2021, reports the Resolution Foundation. Emily Fry, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, says: “Energy bills more than doubled in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and deepened the cost-of-living crisis across Europe. Households will be relieved to see the energy price cap fall once again to below £1,600, with households spending £370 less for energy this year than last. “However, the shock has left households paying more for less energy, with more than six in ten households still worried about paying their bills. And with the majority of gas consumption taking place in winter, it’s the winter price cap that matters most for living standards.” Online retail sales, which ought to benefit from bad weather, also fell in April. The ONS reports that non-store retailing (online shops, plus stalls and markets) fell by 0.9% in April – a smaller decline than the 2.3% drop in total sales volumes. The amount spent online fell by 1.2% during April, and by 1.5% over the year. But as overall spending fell by more, online’s share of sales rose to 26.5%, from 26.2% in March. Spending on petrol and diesel also fell last month, as motorists were hit by higher costs. This morning’s retail sales eport shows that automotive fuel sales volumes fell by 4.9% in April, which is the largest monthly fall since October 2021, Retailers reported the cost of living and the impact of rising fuel prices as factors, the ONS says. The cost of living squeeze, and the bad weather, combined to drive down retail sales in April (see opening post), retail experts say. Kris Hamer, director of insight at the British Retail Consortium, says struggling customers resisted buying ‘big ticket’ items last month. That’s a reminder that households aren’t suddenly wealthier just because the annual inflation rate has fallen…. Hamer explains: “Sales volumes saw significant decline in April, falling for the third time in five months as the gloomy, wet weather combined with the cost of living squeeze dampened spending. Cosmetics continued to sell well, and computer sales were boosted thanks to promotional activity and consumers upgrading their tech a few years after the pandemic surge in tech sales. Meanwhile, clothing and footwear and furniture failed to deliver due to the poor weather and consumers thinking twice before buying high ticket items. UK politicians are being urged to offer more help to households struggling with their energy bills, despite this morning’s cut to the price cap. Charity National Debtline is calling for a “Help to Repay” scheme, under which the government would provide repayment matching and debt write off options for households who face unaffordable energy debts. Steve Vaid, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, explains: “The modest fall in the energy price cap will provide some relief to households, yet energy arrears remain at record levels. Millions of people will remain trapped in energy debt without further support. “Urgent action is needed to help struggling households. “Tackling mounting energy arrears should be a priority for the next Government, through a Help to Repay Scheme to ensure people have access to a safe route out of energy debt. “I would urge anyone worried about their energy bills to seek free, independent debt advice from a service like National Debtline as soon as possible. Our advisers are here to help and can talk you through the right options for you.” National Debtline also reports that more than a third of callers to its helpline are struggling with energy arrears. Retail sales across Great Britain in April are much weaker than expected. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a drop of around 0.4% on the month, so they’ll be startled to learn that volumes shrank by 2.3%. Ashley Webb, economist at Capital Economics, told clients this morning: The 2.3% m/m fall in retail sales volumes in April was much bigger than most expected (CE forecast -0.5% m/m, consensus -0.4% m/m), due to the unusually wet weather discouraging shoppers from visiting physical stores. But as inflation falls further this year, rising real household disposable income should boost retail activity throughout the rest of 2024. Retailers will be worried by the tumble in sales last month, says Erin Brookes, European Retail and Consumer Lead at consultancy Alvarez &amp; Marsal: After two consecutive months of stagnant growth, retailers will be concerned about today’s figures and the outlook for the traditionally buoyant spring and summer period. It’s clear that shoppers were still not in the mood to spend, potentially dampened by an early Easter and a very wet April. With clothing retailers, sports equipment stores, games and toys stores, and furniture stores suffering the most. Newsflash: British households should benefit from lower energy costs this summer. The energy price cap in Great Britain will fall by 7% from July to September, thanks to a fall in wholesale gas prices, energy regulator Ofgem has announced. Ofgem says its cap will fall by the equivalent of £122 per year this summer, meaning the typical household would pay £1,568 per year (although there’s no limit to how high bills can go). This cap, on the average cost of a unit of energy, reflects the average annual dual-fuel bill for 29m households, and takes effect from July until the end of September. That’s a fall from its current level of £1,690, easing the pressure on household finances. But, while a drop in energy bills is clearly welcome for hard-pressed consumers, households will still be paying much more than a few years ago. My colleague Alex Lawson explains: It still leaves bills far above the £1,154 seen in the summer of 2021, before the energy crisis. Wholesale gas prices began to rise sharply in 2021 and escalated after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Bill have since eased from their peak in 2023 – when the cap reached £4,279, but the government subsidised bills to keep them at £2,500 – but remain above pre-crisis levels, meaning millions of households are expected to remain in fuel poverty. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the economy. Economic news takes on extra significance in an election campaign. Every survey and data release becomes a healthcheck on the economy, scrutinised for signs that the economy is improving, or ailing. And this morning, we’ve just learned that retail spending weakened last month, with sales volumes and values both falling sharply in April. Retail sales across Great Britain tumbled by 2.3% in April, the Office for National Statistics reports, following a fall of 0.2% in March (which has been revised down from 0.0%). On an annual basis, retail sales volumes were 2.7% lower than in April 2023 – and 3.8% below their levels before the Covid-19 pandemic. Not an encouraging economic signal. Sales volumes fell across most sectors, with clothing retailers, sports equipment, games and toys stores, and furniture stores doing badly. The ONS blames the rain and storms which hit Britain in April, saying that “poor weather reduced footfall.” Last month was the UK’s sixth wettest April since 1836. Sales volumes at department, clothing, household and other non-food stores fell by 4.1% in April, which is the joint largest fall since January 2021. Phil Monkhouse, UK Country Manager at global financial services firm Ebury, says: “Retailers were caught in the rain in April as retail sales volumes unexpectedly dropped by 2.3%, marking the first significant month-on-month downturn since December’s 3.3% cliff face drop. “Cooling inflation and a marked dip in energy prices in April didn’t translate to heightened footfall as sticky interest rates and the wetter weather held back consumers from splashing out. “With the snap general election announcement injecting fresh uncertainty into the minds of consumers, retailers should not bet on the summer weather significantly lifting spending any time soon.” The slump in retail spending comes despite a rise in UK consumer confidence, which has risen this month to its highest in nearly two-and-a-half years. GfK’s Consumer Confidence Index rose by two points in May to minus 17, the highest level since December 2021, lifted by improved optimism about personal finances.

        "title": "Five pieces of economic news that could affect UK election result",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak’s slim chance of pulling off a victory against the odds in July’s general election depends on voters buying the argument that tough decisions taken since he became prime minister are paying off. That claim will be tested over the next six weeks – with every piece of economic news more closely scrutinised than usual for evidence that the UK’s tentative economic recovery is gaining momentum or has started to falter. There are five key dates – crammed into a 10-day period in the middle of the campaign – to look out for. 11 June: labour market figures This could be one of the trickier pieces of economic news for Sunak to cope with since the last set of official data showed unemployment rising and job vacancies declining. Despite this evidence that the labour market is cooling, earnings growth remained strong, rising at an annual rate of 5.9%. In better news for the prime minister, wages have been rising more strongly than prices for the past 10 months, resulting in rising living standards. The Conservatives will say: four million jobs have been created since 2010 and workers are becoming better off. Labour will say: for the first time in recent history, voters will be worse off at the end of a parliament than they were at the start. 12 June: growth figures for April One factor behind Sunak’s decision to call an election was the unexpectedly strong growth figures for the first three months of 2024, which showed national output 0.6% higher than in the final three months of 2023 and brought to an end the UK’s short and shallow recession. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, expects gross domestic product to rise by 02% between March and April, pushing up the quarterly growth rate from 0.6% to 0.8%. The Conservatives will say: Britain is growing faster than other leading developed economies. Labour will say: over the past 14 years Britain’s growth and productivity record has been dismal. 19 June: annual inflation in the year to May This is probably the most important single piece of economic news during the campaign, given Sunak’s claim that the UK’s cost of living problem has now been cracked. The all-items annual inflation rate came down from 3.2% in March to 2.3% in April and is set to fall further in May. In part, that’s because consumer prices rose by 0.7% last May, a hefty increase that is unlikely to be repeated this year. Bruna Skarica, the chief UK economist at Morgan Stanley, sees the headline inflation rate falling to 2% – smack on the government’s target. Services inflation, which is closely watched by the Bank of England, should fall from 5.9% to 5.4%, Skarica says. The Conservatives will say: our tough action has brought stability to the economy. Labour will say: prices are 20% higher than they were at the start of the cost of living crisis and are still going up. 20 June: Bank of England interest rate decision The Bank of England raised interest rates 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023 – a jump from 0.1% to 5.25% – and there had been growing speculation that its monetary policy committee might start reducing borrowing costs at its June meeting. In theory, there is nothing to prevent the Bank cutting rates during an election campaign, but it would need to have strong evidence to do so. The City now sees little chance of a rate cut next month, with attention focused on whether the Bank will cut rates at its first post-election meeting in August. The Conservatives will say: interest rates are coming down soon because we have fixed the economy. Labour will say: homeowners are paying for Tory mismanagement through higher mortgage rates. 21 June: retail sales and public finances The last of the big five economic events between now and the election, and, while less significant than the other four, it is not without interest. A strong retail sales number would chime with recent evidence that consumers are feeling more confident about the state of their own finances and the economy more generally. Falling retail sales would suggest the absence of a feelgood factor. The poor state of the public finances helps explain why Sunak called an early election because had they been in better shape Jeremy Hunt would now be planning to cut national insurance contributions for a third time in an early autumn statement. The size of the May deficit will have little bearing on the election but will provide a guide to the difficult choices either a Conservative or Labour chancellor might be faced with in the next parliament. The deficit in May 2023 was just over £14bn. The Conservatives will say: life is getting better, so don’t let Labour wreck things. Labour will say: you are paying higher taxes because the Tories crashed the car. Take away the keys. Dales says overall the economic news over the next six weeks will be “reasonably positive” but suspects it will not have much of an impact. “People’s views on the economy are formed and baked in,” he says. “They are not going to change that much.”",

        "title": "Rain hits retail sales in Great Britain as shoppers reduce spending",
        "content": "A month of unrelenting rain in many parts of the country resulted in British shoppers spending much less than expected in April, with fewer treating themselves to clothes and big-ticket items. The Office for National Statistics blamed the wet weather for the 2.3% decrease in the amount of goods bought, compared with March, which was much steeper than the 0.4% decline forecast by analysts. Furniture, clothing, sports equipment, and games and toy shops experienced the biggest monthly sales drops, with non-food store sales falling 4.1%, the joint largest drop since January 2021. Retailers blamed low footfall amid bad weather, the high cost of living despite a decline in the annual pace of inflation to 2.3%, and high fuel prices. Petrol sales dropped at their fastest rate since October 2021, while food stores sales volumes fell for the third month in a row. There were only two bright spots in the data: online sales, which rose 1.1% in April, compared with March, and a 0.4% uplift in department store sales. Danni Hewson, the head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said people had got used to making do without. “The shock of the last few years on personal finances has made many wary,” she said. “It didn’t help that Easter came early and all those tasty chocolate eggs and family feasts were totted up in the previous month’s numbers, but even then, March’s flat lining sales were revised down.” The figures will be discouraging to the government during an election campaign, but they do not signal a true downturn, according to analysts at Capital Economics. “The weakness in April was probably a one-off,” said Ashley Webb, a UK economist. Webb said retail sales could bounce back by 3% in May, given that consumer confidence was improving. GfK’s consumer confidence index rose by two points in May to -17, the highest level since December 2021, as people began to feel more positive about their personal finances. However, Phil Monkhouse, the UK country manager at the global financial services firm Ebury, said that even if the weather improved, shoppers might hold off spending because of uncertainty around policies and interest rates. “With the snap general election announcement injecting fresh uncertainty into the minds of consumers, retailers should not bet on the summer weather significantly lifting spending any time soon,” he said.",

        "title": "Tech titan Mike Lynch testifies at fraud trial that Autonomy was ‘not perfect’",
        "content": "The British entrepreneur Mike Lynch took the stand on Thursday in a San Francisco federal courthouse as a key witness in his own criminal fraud trial, defending his role at Autonomy, the tech firm he co-founded and then sold. The trial continued as planned Thursday despite the defense team moving for a mistrial over alleged improper questioning of a witness by the prosecution. Lynch’s defense team called the questioning, which indirectly referenced the tech titan’s extradition, “egregious” and “highly improper” in a filing. US district judge Charles Breyer denied the motion to dismiss, but acknowledged the prosecution’s questions were improper and ordered the jury to exclude the questions and subsequent testimony from their deliberation. US authorities have charged Lynch with 16 counts of wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy relating to his company’s acquisition deal with Hewlett-Packard in 2011, alleging he artificially inflated Autonomy’s sales, misleading auditors, analysts, and regulators. If convicted, Lynch faces up to 25 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty. In his testimony, Lynch said his job involved delegating many tasks to employees, and that his background upon founding the company was more technical in nature than business-focused. While the government has painted Lynch’s business dealings as clearly fraudulent, Lynch in his testimony on Thursday attempted to highlight more complexity, stating that like any business, Autonomy was “not perfect”. “The reality of life is that it’s nuanced, and it is messy,” he said. “[In this trial] we are peering through the door and seeing the sausage being made. One thing to bear in mind is if you take the microscope into a spotless kitchen, you will always find bacteria. And I don’t think Autonomy is any different.” The Autonomy co-founder described the trial experience thus far as “surreal”, saying he has watched “a parade of witnesses [he’s] never met” describe decisions in which he had no involvement. Prosecutors have called upwards of 30 witnesses since the trial began in March. Lynch addressed the jury directly throughout his questioning, explaining concepts central to the case including earnings reports, hardware sales and the timeline of Autonomy’s founding and ill-fated acquisition. He also paused to explain Britishisms to the American jury, including phrases like “bean counters” and “good bloke”. Much of the questioning Thursday sought to address the government’s focus on Autonomy’s dealings in hardware sales. The prosecution claims that although the company had portrayed itself as a software company, it relied heavily on hardware sales, something Lynch “did everything he could” to conceal from the market. Lynch said Autonomy often sold hardware and software together as a package, and that hardware sales were an important means to mitigate business risks, including changing relationships with suppliers. Court adjourned Thursday afternoon before the defense finished questioning, which will resume on Tuesday following a US holiday. Lynch is the final witness the defense will call to the stand, meaning the trial will be wrapping in the coming weeks.",

        "content": "So much for the idea that the woes of the water sector, and Thames Water in particular, would kill investors’ appetite for all British infrastructure assets. Here comes National Grid, which will probably be the UK’s biggest-spending infrastructure company over the next decade, with a mammoth fundraising that would not be possible if the stink from Thames had infected everything in the vicinity. National Grid’s near-£7bn rights issue, to back a five-year, £60bn spending programme in the UK and US, is the biggest by a London-listed company since 2009. It is larger than expected and comes before the UK energy regulator, Ofgem, has nailed down the price control regime for the 2026-31 period. Throw in the supposed uncertainties created by Thames, plus a general election, and you might assume the safe option would have been to wait a while. Instead, the notable feature of Thursday’s announcement is how easily one can raise £7bn when the cash is needed to help fund investment, rather than to repair a broken balance sheet. The rights issue is underwritten and the company will have its money on 12 June. Yes, the shares fell 11% as the market absorbed the dilution from the new equity, but that’s par for the course for this sort of exercise. Financial markets, one can conclude, are not suffering a general panic about the UK’s regulation of utilities, which is what a few scaremongers in the water industry wanted the outside world to believe. Instead, investors seem to have reached the commonsense conclusion that Thames’s troubles are self-inflicted and isolated. The read-across, as City analysts like to say, to other infrastructure sectors is roughly nil. Electricity networks are not exactly like water, of course. The regulators are different and electricity comes with a net zero halo as windfarms, solar farms and nuclear stations are plugged into the grid. Yet the tale from water’s contagion merchants was that funding costs could rise across the UK infrastructure landscape if Thames went down the plughole, wiping out its shareholders and (possibly) inflicting some pain on its bondholders. As things currently stand, though, such terrible visions aren’t materialising. Even in the water sector itself, borrowing costs for the better-run companies have only risen modestly during Thames’s public agonies. That analysis could change when Ofwat, the water regulator, eventually opines on the business plans, bill increases and cost of capital for the next five-year period. (The day was also due to be 12 June, but the election may now cause a delay). Proposals that are seen as “tough” on the companies’ financial returns might indeed affect investors’ appetite to put up capital. But that outcome is probably not the way to bet, as argued in this column previously. Ofwat, like Ofgem, wants to accelerate investment, which means allowing profitable returns on capital. The difference with Thames is simply that it is an outlier. Its financial engineering was more extreme and its operational performance more appalling than the rest; no regulator anywhere can be seen to land bill payers with the cost of those mistakes. Thames’s “special case” status seems to be understood by financial markets. If you don’t screw up monumentally, life carries on. The contagion risk for wider UK infrastructure looks minimal.",

        "title": "‘Mild positive’: markets greet prospect of Labour landslide with calm",
        "content": "Five years ago, the prospect of a landslide Labour election victory might have been expected to prompt at least some anxiety in financial markets. In a sign of how successful Keir Starmer’s campaign to woo the City and move his party’s position to the centre has been, markets barely budged in response to news that a vote would be held this summer. The FTSE 100 opened flat on Thursday, the pound pushed slightly higher and stock futures a touch lower as markets appeared relaxed about the likelihood of a Starmer win, having had more than a year of reading about 15-point-plus poll leads to get used to the idea. “A Labour government is not considered to be a risk scenario; in fact, investors seem sympathetic to the idea,” said Roman Ziruk, a senior market analyst at the global financial services firm Ebury. “Investors want stability, and we are now at a stage whereby a Labour majority, while heavily priced in, would probably be perceived by them as a mild positive for sterling, even if only due to the avoidance of a dreaded hung parliament.” While there are a few bits of economic data still to come before 4 July that could move the dial, most investors are working on the assumption that Starmer will be the next prime minister. If that comes to pass, many foresee a similar market response to Tony Blair’s landslide victory in 1997, in which traders were reassured by a widely expected outcome. “Basically, markets just rallied straight through … There wasn’t a lot of policy change on the table and there wasn’t a lot of election uncertainty,” said Ben Laidler, a global markets strategist at the trading platform eToro. Starmer’s message may be “change” but he may turn out to be unable and unwilling to enact a significant shift in economic policy. A spending bonanza is unlikely, given recent memories of the economic calamity that followed Liz Truss’s unbalanced mini-budget in September 2022. He may have no choice but to increase taxes to meet spending commitments. A pledge to stick to the existing fiscal rules, overseen by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, leaves him little room for manoeuvre. Under these rules, recent budgets have pencilled in a 1%-a-year real-terms increase in spending. However, once spending pledges in areas such as health and defence are accounted for, that translates to a real-terms cut for unprotected departments, especially as higher inflation means hospitals, prisons, schools and councils are able to buy less with the same budget. “There’s a general sense that given the challenges in public services, these real-terms cuts will be difficult to achieve in practice and will require greater spending commitment,” said James Smith, a developed markets economist at ING. “There’s very limited room to address this without raising taxes.” As for Rishi Sunak’s chances, Philip Shaw, the chief economist at the international wealth management group Investec, pointed out that he may have chosen an election date of 4 July in the hope of getting a fillip from a possible interest rate cut by the Bank of England two weeks before that. However, the prospect of such a lifeline seem to be fading. On Wednesday morning it emerged that inflation had fallen by less than forecast in April, to 2.3%. Since then, market bets on when the Bank will bring the cost of borrowing down from the current 5.25% have become less optimistic. On Tuesday, traders were saying a first rate cut in June was more likely than not; by Thursday the forecast was 90% no change. In fact, only one full cut is priced in by the end of the year, and could come as late as November, adding to the tough economic in-tray facing whoever next occupies No 10.",

        "title": "‘Rostering to the limits’: senior Virgin Australia pilots raise safety concerns over fatigue",
        "content": "Senior pilots at Virgin Australia have alleged fatigue is widespread in their ranks and raised safety concerns about a roster system some claim is working them “to the limits”. Guardian Australia has obtained correspondence from senior pilots pleading for action to address worker fatigue as Virgin Australia and the Transport Workers Union (TWU) remain in a standoff over a proposal to strip pilots of six days’ annual leave during negotiations for a new enterprise agreement. The correspondence seen by Guardian Australia reveals: Multiple senior pilots say the rostering system used by Virgin is adding to fatigue levels. The system routinely schedules pilots to work maximum shift lengths – 11-12 hours and longer in the event of delays – on back-to-back days, while allowing for just the legal minimum rest period of 12 hours. Pilots have raised concerns with management about the roster software and claim that the private equity owners of the airline, Bain Capital, have not followed through on a promise to replace it. Frustration at what they claim is management’s failure to recognise these issues, or respond to staff warning of a resulting “clear, present and increasing safety risk”. In an internal pilots’ messaging group discussing rostering and fatigue issues, one asked: “Would they like to see blood?” “The practice of rostering to the limits, ‘because we don’t expect anything to go wrong’, is absolutely crap,” the pilot added. Responding to questions from Guardian Australia, a Virgin Australia spokesperson said the airline “operates under a robust fatigue management system approved by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority” in “extensive consultation with pilots”, adding that “our pilots have the highest number of rostered days off in the industry at 156 per year”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Emails between November 2023 and continuing into this year show senior pilots at Virgin Australia drawing a link between the rostering and bidding system, which allows pilots to preference shifts they want to work or swap, and their feelings of fatigue and sense of work-life balance. The pilots claim the current rostering system, a “lite” version of the software Sabre, is not fit for purpose and that while they accepted its use during the airline’s pandemic-era struggle out of administration, it was now neglecting to bring in a functional system – something workers have called for during enterprise deals dating back to 2007 – to reduce its costs. The airline posted a $129m net profit last financial year – the airline’s first in 11 years – and the TWU has claimed Bain has failed to address “rock-bottom pay, improve work-life balance and fix unsafe rostering”. “The rostering / bidding system is intrinsically linked to our well being and our quality of life”, one senior pilot warned in an email in November. “Our lives are dictated by and completely dependent on it.” In a later email, the pilot wrote: “It is clear there is a distinct lack of, and complete break down of trust in the company from our pilot group, especially in consideration of Virgin failing to meet its [enterprise agreement] obligations … Virgin has proven time again it either refuses to meet them or is incapable of doing so.” One pilot said “the cancerous lack of morale and resentment will continue to grow unchecked” if pay concerns, conditions and work rules were not addressed. “Morale is now so low that it’s beginning to have very clear and present safety implications. You can’t afford to pay us more? You can’t afford an accident either,” the pilot wrote, referencing a discussion with staff who conduct safety checks. Unions split on enterprise agreement Pilots appeared in dismay after receiving an update from the company in March that a new rostering system project was being paused, according to the correspondence. The revelations come as the airline pushes a new enterprise agreement that has split the unions representing Virgin pilots. While pilots represented by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) are understood to be open to a deal that would cut six days of annual days off, pilots represented by the TWU are opposed. Under the current deal, which lapses at the end of June, pilots are entitled to 12 days off every 28-day roster period, of which there are 13 periods a year. Virgin Australia is proposing that for six of the 13 roster periods, days off would be cut to 11. If no agreement is reached by the end of June, workers will be able to take protected industrial action. A poll of 180 pilots – of the roughly 1,000 who work at Virgin – conducted by the TWU, revealed 95% of respondents do not feel valued by the airline and Bain, with 93% intending to vote no to the proposed deal and 88% specifically unhappy at the planned reduction in days off. In the survey, 85% said the rostering system had affected how they managed their fatigue, with 82% saying it had affected their family life and 55% saying it was damaging their mental health. Should the proposal to cut pilots’ days off go ahead, 42% said they would consider leaving their job. One pilot told the union that while pilots as a group had raised issues about fatigue, individual pilots were hesitant to alert management when they personally felt fatigued, as it could lead to them being forced to take a medical test. Failing such a test would force off a shift, affecting their pay. Another pilot told the union that “Virgin is now just a toxic place to work”, while another added: “Poor management, poor rostering, no work-life balance, feeling of being undervalued, feeling of being not appreciated for the sacrifices we make for the company and no support when we need it.” The TWU national assistant secretary, Emily McMillan, said the revelations should be a wake-up call for Virgin and Bain to take the fatigue and mental health of its pilots seriously. “Instead, the airline is trying to claw back six days off per year. We need to see this proposal dropped and a fair enterprise agreement settled so pilots can concentrate on the crucial job they do without feeling stressed at work and at home.” Under the proposed deal – which has been agreed to by the AFAP which represents a majority of pilots at Virgin – pilots would receive a 9.38% pay rise in the first year, and 3% rises in the second and third years, in return for the loss of the six days off. The Virgin Australia spokesperson said it would soon invite pilots to vote on the new enterprise agreement, which it said “reflects our strong desire to reward and recognise our pilots for the important work that they do, while also protecting our ability to deliver great choice and value to the Australian public”. “Our pilots also have the highest rest protections in the industry with additional fatigue-related protections included in the proposed EA,” they said. The spokesperson said the proposed reduction from 156 days off to 150 days would still leave its pilots with more days off than its major Australian competitors. They said the reduction would improve Virgin’s ability to operate during peak flying months.",

        "title": "US sues Ticketmaster owner Live Nation and seeks break-up of alleged monopoly ",
        "content": "The US Department of Justice has sued the owner of Ticketmaster, Live Nation, seeking a break-up of the concert promotion and ticketing giant. “It is time to break up Live Nation-Ticketmaster,” said Merrick Garland, the US attorney general. “Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators.” Thursday’s lawsuit, filed in the southern district of New York , follows years of scrutiny of Live Nation’s domination of global ticket sales. Attorneys general from 29 states and Washington DC joined the lawsuit. The company, which merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, faced a torrent of criticism in the wake of the botched sale of tickets to Taylor Swift’s Eras tour in 2022. As fury over the debacle mounted, officials are said to have started an antitrust investigation. Live Nation has used a monopoly to suppress competition, the justice department and a string of states alleged in a court filing. Lawmakers have accused the company of sky-high fees, poor customer service and anticompetitive practices. Allegations in the lawsuit include that Live Nation has worked with a venue management firm to steer clients into signing exclusive agreements with Ticketmaster, that it has threatened retaliation and acquired startups to stop competition, that it signs long-term exclusive agreements with venues that prevent them from using any potential competitors and that Ticketmaster became the default ticketing platform for several entertainment artists because LiveNation controls a large share of the venues where they perform. “The live music industry in America is broken because Live Nation-Ticketmaster has an illegal monopoly,” said Jonathan Kanter, an assistant attorney general with the justice department’s antitrust division in a press release. “Our antitrust lawsuit seeks to break up Live Nation-Ticketmaster’s monopoly and restore competition for the benefit of fans and artists.” During a press conference announcing the lawsuit, Garland described his own experience as a senior in college of attending a Bonnie Raitt concert, and seeing Bruce Springsteen open for her. “The justice department filed this lawsuit on behalf of fans who should be able to go to concerts without a monopoly standing in their way,” he said. “We have filed this lawsuit on behalf of artists who should be able to plan their tours around their fans and not be dictated by an unlawful monopolists. We have filed this lawsuit on behalf of the independent promoters and venues which should be able to compete on a level playing field. And we have filed this lawsuit on behalf of the American people.”. But Live Nation has repeatedly pushed back against claims that it is in effect a monopoly, arguing that it has “very little to do” with high ticket prices. Live Nation said in response to the lawsuit, “We will defend against these baseless allegations, use this opportunity to shed light on the industry, and continue to push for reforms that truly protect consumers and artists.” After the 2022 mishandling of Swift ticket sales, Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, told the Wall Street Journal that the fiasco “converted more Gen Z’ers into antimonopolists overnight than anything I could have done”. When “firms become dominant, they become too big to care”, she claimed.",

        "title": "UK company growth slows in blow to Sunak; NatWest share sale threatened by general election – as it happened",
        "content": "Time for a quick recap. Growth in UK business activity has weakened this month, led by a slowdown in the services sector. The Bank of England has cancelled all speeches and public statements by policymakers during the UK election campaign. The general election is also expected to scupper government plans to sell its stake in NatWest to the public this summer. Royal Mail’s parent company has delayed the release of its annual results, which were due this morning. Output growth at American companies has hit a two-year high this month, the latest poll of US purchasing managers, just released, shows. S&amp;P Global’s flash PMI survey shows an acceleration of business growth this month, which signals an improved economic performance. The service sector led the upturn, reporting the largest output rise for a year, but manufacturing also showed stronger growth, the PMI report found. The Bank of England has cancelled all speeches and public statements by policymakers during the UK election campaign. A spokesperson for the central bank says it will cancel public engagements for its policymakers up until the July 4 national election. This is an attempt to prevent comments from the Bank influencing (or being seen to influence) the election, even though the BoE is not bound by official government rules about the conduct of civil servants during election campaigns. The decision will not stop the BoE setting interest rates at its next scheduled meeting on 20 June, though. The money markets now expect ‘no change’ next month, with a 93% chance that bank rate is maintained at 5.25% in June. Royal Mail’s parent company has blamed its auditors for a delay to its latest financial results. We were expecting International Distribution Services to release its full year financial results at 7am this morning, but they surprisingly didn’t appear. Now, IDS – which is being pursued by Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský – has announced a delay to the publication of its financial results for the 53 weeks ended 31 March 202 IDS blames its auditors, saying: The Group’s auditor, KPMG, has requested additional time to complete the usual standard procedures after their internal reviews were late in the audit timetable, thereby delaying their final audit process. IDS adds that it expects its adjusted operating profit, excluding voluntary redundancy costs, for the last year to be broadly in line with previously published guidance. Just in: The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week. The number of fresh ‘initial claims’ for jobless support fell by 8,000 to 215,000 in the week to 18 May. That suggests the US jobs market remains strong, encouraging firms to hold onto workers. The UK equity market has done better since 1962, on average, when the Conservatives have triumphed at the ballot box, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould reports. Mould has crunched the numbers, and found that the the capital return from FTSE All-Share has averaged 4.1% in the first year after a Labour win, but 5.7% after a Conservative triumph. But this time, investors aren’t likely to be spooked by Labour’s large poll lead, he explains: “The prospect of a government spearheaded by Sir Keir and Rachel Reeves is unlikely to spark the sort of fear that would have been inspired by an administration whose driving forces were Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. Moreover, the current Conservative government, whose tenure effectively dates back to 2010 and covers a flurry of five prime ministers, could be seen as having taken an increasingly interventionist approach to the economy, given such initiatives as sugar taxes, Help to Buy, energy price caps, windfall taxes on North Sea oil producers, 2021’s National Security and Investment Act and proposals for changes to the 2005 Gambling Act under the recent review. Over in Istanbul, Turkey’s central bank has left kept interest rates unchanged today…. at 50%. The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye resisted changing borrowing costs, after inflation climbed to 69.8% in April, up from 68.5% in March. The Bank’s monetary policy committee says it is highly attentive to inflation risks, adding: The tight monetary stance will be maintained until a significant and sustained decline in the underlying trend of monthly inflation is observed, and inflation expectations converge to the projected forecast range. Monetary policy stance will be tightened in case a significant and persistent deterioration in inflation is foreseen. The City have taken yesterday’s surprise general election announcement in their stride. The pound is trading flat this morning, at $1.272, while the blue-chip FTSE 100 index is just 4 points higher, +0.05%, at 8374. Analyts at ING says UK investors have become accustomed to political drama over the past few year. ING cite five reasons why this election has the potential to be less exciting and volatile in markets: Labour is miles ahead in the polls; unlike 2019, Brexit is no longer a major unknown; Scottish referendum remains unlikely'; neither party is promising radical fiscal policy shifts, and an election doesn’t shift the Bank of England outlook They add, though, that the pound could be influenced by “noise” in the July vote. That could be generated from pre-election policy pledges by Labour. Any news concerning plans on future relationships with the EU could also generate some GBP [the pound] noise. The most impactful news would probably be on a new Scottish referendum which, as we note above, looks unlikely. However, this would likely just be noise, and the direction will still be dictated by monetary policy in the UK and the US. As we don’t see the BoE changing its policy plans due to the election, the overall implications for sterling should be limited. The Treasury says it is “working through internal due process” with regard to the proposed sale of its stake in NatWest (see earlier post). The sale seems likely to be scuppered by the purdah period that restricts government activity in the run-up to a general election. That must disappoint chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who had hoped to stimulate public interest in London’s stock market, as the Conservative privatisations of the 1980s did. The sharp slowdown in growth in Britain’s services sector this month is a concern, as services makes up around three-quarters of the economy. Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments, explains: “UK Services PMI data for the month of May came in at the bottom end of forecasts at 52.9, still in expansionary territory but notably, the lowest reading in the last 6 months – it doesn’t auger well for the broader economy if the dominant services sector is genuinely starting to slow, which this data release indicates. On the flip side, manufacturing PMI data showed a surprise move into expansion with a reading of 51.3, marking an end to the long contraction seen in this sector since August 2022. The UK’s financial watchdog has fined HSBC £6.2m for failing to properly treat customers who were in arrears or experiencing financial difficulty. The Financial Conduct Authority imposed the penalty after finding that, between June 2017 and October 2018, HSBC failed to properly consider people’s circumstances when they had missed payments. This meant that HSBC didn’t conduct the right affordability assessments when entering arrangements with people to reduce or clear their arrears'; on some occasions the bank took “disproportionate action” when people fell behind with payments, which risked pushing them into deeper financial difficulty. Overall, the PMIs paint a picture of a recovering economy, says Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, adding: It will probably not be until the second half of the year when growth picks up sharply with lower inflation, falling interest rates and tax cuts kickstarting consumer spending, which should then flow through to an improvement in business confidence and the rest of the economy.” Although the composite UK PMI has fallen in May, the survey data is consistent with GDP rising by around 0.3% in the second quarter of this year, says Daniel Mahoney, UK economist at Handelsbanken. That would be a slowdown on Q1, when the economy expanded by 0.6% – but would also mean the UK was still growing, after last year’s short, shallow, technical recession. Newsflash: the confectionary company behind Cadbury, Côte d’Or, Milka, Oreo, Ritz, Toblerone and TUC biscuits has been fined €337.5m (£287m) for breaking European competition rules. Mondelēz has been penalised by EU antitrust regulators on Thursday for impeding the cross-border trade of chocolate, biscuits and coffee products between EU countries. This, the EU says, prevented retailers from being able to freely source products in Member States with lower prices – allowing Mondelēz to continue charging more for its own products. Announcing the fine, the European Commission said Mondelez had also abused its dominant position in certain national markets for the sale of chocolate tablets. It declared that Mondelēz had engaged in 22 anticompetitive practices, including: Limiting the territories or customers to which seven wholesale customers (traders/“brokers”) could resell Mondelēz’ products. One agreement also included a provision ordering Mondelēz’ customer to apply higher prices for exports compared to domestic sales. These agreements and concerted practices took place between 2012 and 2019 and covered all EU markets. Preventing ten exclusive distributors active in certain Member States from replying to sale requests from customers located in other Member States without prior permission from Mondelēz. These agreements and practices took place between 2006 and 2020 and covered all the EU markets. On the other hand…. economist Julian Jessop of the free market Institute of Economic Affairs says today’s PMI report shows the economy is recovering: As flagged earlier, the drop in the composite PMI shows the private sector economy is growing slower in May than in April. Today’s May flash PMI survey will have provided the Bank of England with some comfort after the stronger-than-expected inflation data for April, says Capital Economics. They told clients: Crucially, the further fall in the services output prices balance suggests that services inflation will continue to drop. The output and activity balances were also weaker than anticipated, suggesting that GDP growth will not repeat Q1’s bumper increase. This month’s UK PMI report (see last post) is weaker than expected, points out Reuters, adding: Growth across British businesses has cooled noticeably this month and by more than any economist polled by Reuters had predicted, a survey showed on Thursday, in an early blow for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s election campaign. More here. Newsflash: Growth across the UK private sector is slowing this month, in what appears to be a blow to the government’s election strategy. Data firm S&amp;P Global Insight’s regular poll of purchasing managers at British firms has found that the services sector is recording its weakest growth in six months during May. More encouragingly, though, manufacturing has returned to growth – and firms are raising prices at the slowest rate in over three years. Here’s the details: Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index at 52.8 (down from April’s 54.1), to 2-month low. Flash UK Services PMI Business Activity Index at 52.9 (down from April’s 55.0), to a 6-month low. Flash UK Manufacturing Output Index at 52.7 (up from April’s 49.4), to a 25-month high. Flash UK Manufacturing PMI at 51.3 (up from April’s 49.1), to a 22-month high. Any reading over 50-points shows growth, so Rishi Sunak can at least point to that. But a slowdown in growth doesn’t bolster the PM’s claim the economy has “turned the corner”. The PMI survey also found there was only a marginal increase in employment at companies this month, with some companies blaming candidate shortages and wage costs. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says “The flash PMI survey data for May signalled a further expansion of UK business activity, suggesting the economy continues to recover from the mild recession seen late last year. The survey data are consistent with GDP rising by around 0.3% in the second quarter, with an encouraging revival of manufacturing accompanied by sustained, but slower, service sector growth. The survey also brings welcome news of a cooling in service sector inflation, which is needed to open the door for the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates. A temporary surge in wage-related cost growth seen in April is showing signs of fading in May. Firms are also reporting that strong competition is limiting their scope to raise prices, especially in the face of weakened demand due to the elevated cost of living. Several City experts have dropped their forecasts that the Bank of England will cut UK interest rates next month, after inflation came in higher than expected yesterday. Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Deutsche Bank all now expect the first rate cut to come in August, rather than June. That’s a blow to Rishi Sunak’s hopes that the Bank could lower borrowing costs before July’s election, which might help people feel better off. Goldman point to yesterday’s inflation report, telling clients: Given firmer incoming price and wage data, we no longer expect a June Bank Rate cut. First, services inflation came in at 5.9%yoy (year on year) in April, well ahead of consensus expectations and the MPC‘s May projection of 5.5%yoy. Goldman add that the UK’s growth outlook has “improved significantly”, having returned to growth in the first quarter of the year. The money markets currently suggest that there’s only a 10% chance of a rate cut in June, down from over 50% at the start of the week. Rishi Sunak’s decision to call an election on 4 July appears to have cascaded down to the water industry, causing uncertainty over an announcement by the industry regulator. Ofwat had been due to give its preliminary view of English and Welsh water companies’ business plans for the five years to 2030, which were submitted last year, on 12 June. Now, that update – known as “draft determination” on the PR24 plans - may be delayed until after the election. A final decision is expected to be made at the long-scheduled meeting of the Ofwat board today. The draft determinations are seen as particularly crucial for Thames Water, the heavily indebted supplier which is at risk of falling into a government-handled administration. Its shareholders have refused to stump up any more funds amid a stand-off with Ofwat. An Ofwat spokesperson said: “We are considering pre-election protocols and guidance in relation to our time table for PR24.” Separately, Anglian Water has appointed former HS2 boss Mark Thurston has its next chief executive. He will succeed longstanding Anglian chief Peter Simpson in August. Thurston left his role at the pared-back high-speed rail project after six years in July 2023 and was reportedly Britain’s highest paid public servant at one point during the role. Happy news from Europe: the eurozone economic recovery is gathering pace with new orders rising at the fastest rate in over a year, new data shows. The latest survey of purchasing managers shows that eurozone companies are growing at the fastest rate in 12 months, with business activity, new orders and employment growing at a more rapid pace in May. This lifted the HCOB Flash eurozone composite PMI output index up to 52.3 this month, up from April’s 51.7 – any reading over 50 shows growth. The July election could scupper plans to sell the government’s stake in NatWest bank back to the public. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had been aiming to do a “Tell Sid”-style sale of the stake this summer, aiming to raise funds by selling shares at a discount to small investors. But with the general election now set for 4 July, the fate of the government’s near-30% stake could fall to the next administration. Three sources have told Reuters that Britain is poised to scrap the milestone sale of shares, which were acquired when the government bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland (as NatWest was then known) in the 2008 financial crisis. Analysts at Peel Hunt agree that there is fresh uncertainty over NatWest now, telling clients: This share sale cannot take place before the General Election and the new government, which polls are currently suggesting is likely to be formed by the Labour Party, may or may not proceed with this initiative. Although the UK Government is a passive investor only in NatWest, the presence of the State on the share register in our view is not helpful for the rating of NatWest’s shares. If the Retail Offer is cancelled, this might extend the timeframe over which the complete exit of the UK Government from the register is achieved. Whilst this development does not alter our positive view on the outlook for the company and its shares, the uncertainty is modestly unhelpful for NatWest in our view. Shares in NatWest have dropped by over 1% this morning. Last week, my colleague. Nils Pratley argued that the government should drop the flashy share sale, and stick with its current ‘trading plan’ in which NatWest shares are being dribbled into the market. Elsewhere in the City, shares in energy company National Grid have tumbled 8% after it announced a massive cash call to fund the delivery of renewable energy. National Grid is raising £7bn through a rights issue, in which existing shareholders can buy 7 new shares for every 24 they already own. This £7bn will help to fund a new £60bn capital investment programme, which National Grid says will “deliver a significant step-change” in rolling out critical energy infrastructure in the UK and US. National Grid’s CEO, John Pettigrew, says the plan is “a defining moment for National Grid”, adding: On both sides of the Atlantic, governments and regulators are moving with increased urgency to attract the levels of investment required to meet their decarbonisation targets. As economies become increasingly digital, electrified and decarbonised, the need for energy infrastructure has rarely been more pressing. Our investment will unlock significant economic growth and, by the end of the decade, National Grid is expected to support over 60,000 more jobs, while also decarbonising our energy systems, bolstering security of supply, and reducing consumer bills in the long term. Shares in major veterinary companies are dropping, at the start of trading in London. Pets At Home, which owns around 450 vets practices, are down over 3%. CVS (who we just heard from) are 1% lower. CVS, one of the Big Six companies who now dominate the vets market, has told the London stock market that it will support the CMA with its investigation. In a statement to the City, CVS says: CVS has a clear strategy with its purpose to give the best possible care to animals and its vision to be the veterinary company people most want to work for. The Group is proud of the dedication and commitment of its colleagues in providing great care to its clients and their animals. CVS launched a new clinical governance framework in November 2023 as an industry first in the UK veterinary sector. This clinical governance framework places contextualised care at the heart of the Group’s approach to providing clients and their pets with appropriate care. This focus is neatly reflected in the Group’s approach to understanding client needs under the mantra of “what matters to you, matters to us”. CVS understands that the CMA market investigation commences today and will be conducted over the next 18 months and looks forward to further updates from the CMA at the appropriate time. Last month, my colleague Rupert Neate wrote an excellent piece examining how pet care become such big business. It outlined how pet owners have been paying hundreds, or thousands, of pounds for ever more complex treatments. For example… Everyone seems to have a story: £3,000 for blood tests for a lethargic cat; £2,000 to have a jack russell’s broken tooth removed; £400 to bandage a rabbit’s dislocated toe. Others complain of routinely being sold drugs at several times what they cost online. These spiralling costs have come as six big corporate chains have acquired more and more vets practices, and now own 60% of the market. As Rupert explained: Until a change in the law in 1999, only qualified veterinary surgeons could own vet clinics. This meant most practices were small businesses run by partners who knew their patients and played an important role in the community, just as in the cosy 1980s TV series All Creatures Great and Small. In the last few decades, though, big businesses have been buying up practices at a furious pace, drawn by their often healthy profit margins, which could be increased by consolidating services under a big corporate umbrella. Vets are also regarded as “recession-proof”, as Britons will cut back on just about everything else to prioritise their pets. In 2013 about 10% of vet practices were owned by six large corporations; now 60% are. But the march of the “big six” corporations has gone unnoticed by many pet owners as four out of six practices keep the name and branding of the previous independent business. In the majority of cases they also keep on the existing vets, giving the former owners new titles such as clinical director (and, often, a lottery winner-sized cheque). Well worth a read: The terms of reference of the CMA’s investigation are online here. They explain that the inquiry will examine the supply in the United Kingdom of veterinary services for household pets, including the supply of prescribed veterinary medicines for such pets. It adds: The CMA has reasonable grounds to suspect that a feature or a combination of features of the market for the supply of those goods and services in the UK prevents, restricts, or distorts competition. The CMA has also issued three tips to help pet owners get a good service. 1. Look further than the closest vet Many pet owners told us they choose a vet based simply on how close it is to where they live. It might feel convenient, but fees and services do differ between practices so check to be sure it’s the right one for you. 2. Ask if there are other treatment options Getting a treatment that works for you and your pet is what matters most. It’s important that you understand why your vet has recommended a particular treatment or test. But if you’re not sure about a treatment, or you’re worried about the cost, speak to your vet. 3. If it’s not urgent, consider buying the medication elsewhere When it’s an emergency, we just want to get our pet the medication they need as quickly as possible. But if your pet needs non-urgent care, then it can be cheaper, even when you include your vet’s prescription fee, to buy the medication elsewhere – such as an online pharmacy or specialist pet shop. About one-quarter of pet owners who responded to our call for information were not aware of this. The CMA has appointed an inquiry group to handle its investigation into the veterinary services markets. The group will be chaired by Martin Coleman, a former partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, and spend its first few months collecting more evidence and analysing it. Coleman says the inquiry will be both comprehensive and complex, explaining: The vet services market is worth an estimated £5bn a year and provides a necessary service to pet owners so it’s right that we fully investigate competition concerns – this matters to businesses, veterinary professionals and, crucially, the 16m households in the UK who have pets. Market investigations are, by their nature, comprehensive and complex. They require time to fully explore concerns and to ensure that all points of view are heard so we can reach the right outcomes and take appropriate action, if needed, to make the market work for everyone. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain’s competition authority is getting its teeth into the UK’s £5bn a year veterinary practice market, by launching a full investigation into the sector. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced this morning it will examine concerns that the market wasn’t working properly and that customers are getting a bad deal. The CMA’s move comes after 56,000 people, including customers and vet professionals, raised concerns about practices within the £2bn industry, through the regulator’s initial inquiry into vets. The investigation could force vets to give certain information to consumers – to address concerns that they’re not given the full facts when making decisions about pet care, or impose maximum prescription fees to prevent them bring ripped off. The CMA adds that it could also order the sale or disposal of a business or assets – addressing concerns that private firms have muscled into the vets market in recent years. Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, says this morning that a formal market investigation is “essential”. The message from our vets work so far has been loud and clear – many pet owners and professionals have concerns that need further investigation. We’ve heard from people who are struggling to pay vet bills, potentially overpaying for medicines and don’t always know the best treatment options available to them. We also remain concerned about the potential impact of sector consolidation and the incentives for large, integrated vet groups to act in ways which reduce consumer choice. In March, we proposed that a formal market investigation was the best route to fully explore these concerns and, if appropriate, take direct action to address them. That proposal has been overwhelmingly endorsed through our consultation. While we’re aware of acute staff shortages and difficult working conditions for vets, we consider a formal market investigation is essential to ensure good outcomes for the millions of pet owners in the UK as well as professionals working in the sector. The independent inquiry group will now take this investigation forward and, in the meantime, we’re publishing some tips to help pet owners better navigate vet services. The CMA’s inquiry will examine whether: consumers are getting the information they need, at the right time, to make informed decisions a limited choice of vet businesses in some local areas is impacting pet owners profits earned are consistent with the levels expected in a competitive market vet businesses have the incentive and ability to limit consumer choice when providing treatments or recommending related services, particularly when they are part of large integrated groups the regulatory framework is preventing the market from functioning as well as it could Also coming up today New economic data from the UK, and across the eurozone, will show how Britain and Europe’s private sector companies are faring this month. The UK purchasing managers index is expected to show solid growth across the services sector, and a small contraction in manufacturing. The health of the economy will be closely watched after Rishi Sunak yesterday announced a general election on 4th of July, in a high-stakes gamble. The election is coming earlier than the City expected, says Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank Maybe he is scared that inflation will pick up until autumn and he will lose his ‘we pulled inflation to normal levels’ rhetoric. Whatever it is, the fact that the UK election is due on 4 July combined with yesterday’s hotter-than-expected inflation print, washed out the expectation of a June rate cut from the Bank of England (BoE). That expectation went from a coin flip to none in just one session.

        "title": "Morrisons workers strike at two warehouses amid pensions row",
        "content": "Almost 1,000 workers at two Morrisons warehouses will strike for the next three days over a cut in company contributions to their pensions which they say is worth up to £10m a year. The warehouse stock controllers, cooks, canteen staff, and administrators at the sites in Gadbrook, Cheshire, and Wakefield, West Yorkshire, who earn between £12 and £13 an hour, say they will lose out by an average of £500 a year each from the company’s plan to reduce how much it puts into their pension pot while forcing workers to pay more. Unite, the union representing the workers, says Morrisons is also ditching a long service pay award and increasing the speed at which goods are expected to be processed in warehouses. Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, has accused the supermarket – which is struggling to cope with high levels of debt after a £7bn takeover by the US private equity firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice in 2021 – of “planning to fleece workers”. She said: “These unmerited changes to workers’ pensions will leave our members worse off every month. Unite will not stand for such behaviour from any employer, let alone one like Morrisons who is raking in massive profits during a cost of living crisis.” Until March, workers paid in 3% of their pay into pensions while Morrisons put in 5%, but Morrisons has moved to a policy of each side paying 4% this financial year. Morrisons said it would ultimately pay more into workers’ pensions because of the government’s planned changes to pension auto-enrolment rules, and that the loss in pension contributions per worker would be more than offset by the offered pay rise. At present, workers earning less than £10,000 a year are not automatically enrolled on a pension scheme and companies do not have to pay contributions on earnings below £6,240. The government has agreed to abolish those limits, meaning all workers may have to be enrolled. However, it has yet to schedule a time for the new rules to be implemented, with a consultation not reporting until the autumn, when its findings will be considered by whichever party wins the election on 4 July. Morrisons said the two warehouses affected by industrial action were continuing to operate but at “reduced capacity”. “We have put in place detailed contingency plans across the business and are confident that our customers, stores, suppliers and partners will not be significantly affected,” a spokesperson said, adding that the company was “open to further dialogue with the union”. They said: “We have made a number of new proposals to Unite, including a 9% pay award, a new service award scheme, and improvements to the planned future pension scheme changes. “Disappointingly, Unite has chosen to reject these new proposals without putting them to its members, and instead are continuing with strike action at two out of our seven logistics sites, initially over three days.” The strikes at Morrisons’ depots follow action at hubs operated by Amazon and Asda stores in recent months over pay and conditions, amid a surge in the cost of living and a squeeze on the availability of warehouse workers since Brexit and the pandemic.",

        "content": "The owner of Toblerone, Milka and Oreo has been fined €337.5m (£288m) for anti-competitive practices in the EU. The US food group Mondelēz is one of the world’s largest confectionery companies and also owns Ritz and TUC biscuits and Cadbury and Côte D’Or chocolate. It was found to have been involved in 22 unfair trade practices, according to the European Commission on Thursday. It meant that wholesalers and shoppers and traders were prevented from buying chocolate bars in another member state where they could be up to 40% cheaper or selling into a market where they could get a higher price for their product. The commission said some of the practices were also aimed at restricting the cross-border trade of coffee products. Mondelēz owned the coffee brands JAG, Jacobs and Velours Noir up until 2015. “It is blatantly illegal,” said the EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, adding that the fine sent a “clear signal” the commission would penalise any company that broke the single market rules. “This case is about the price of groceries, which is a key concern to European citizens – and even more obvious in times of very high inflation, where many are in a cost of living crisis.” She said the EU investigation, which started in 2019, showed that Mondelēz had “illegally restricted retailers from sourcing these products from member states where prices are lower” to maintain higher prices. “This harmed consumers who ended up paying more for chocolates, biscuits and coffee,” she said. The restrictive practices breached internal market rules that allowed shoppers to buy from a different member state if products were cheaper or manufacturers or wholesalers to sell in a member state where they got higher prices for their goods. This “parallel trade” was “at the heart” of the concept of the single market, Vestager told reporters. She said the price differences between member states for chocolate ranged between 10% and 40% and “sometimes more”. Vestager said the commission had found that Mondelēz had prevented 11 distributors “from making such sales either by imposing contractual restrictions or by asking them to request permission on a case by case basis”. It also found it had abused its dominant position. In one instance Mondelēz took Côte D’Or chocolate bars off the shelves in the Netherlands to “prevent retailers from re-selling them in Belgium” where they were more expensive. In another case it prevented a wholesaler from buying its chocolate in Germany where it was cheaper. Vestager said the breaches were “very serious” but the commission took account of the fact that Mondelēz had cooperated with the investigation. In light of this, and the “efficient resolution” of the case, it had decided to reduce the fine by 15%. The unfair practices had stopped in 2020, the commission said.",

        "title": "UK watchdog launches full investigation into vet fees for pet owners ",
        "content": "The UK competition regulator has launched a formal investigation into the £2bn veterinary market, over concerns that pet owners could be overpaying for medicines and are not always aware of the best treatment options available. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced on Thursday it was pushing ahead with a review of the sector in a move that could result in prescription fees being capped and leading pet-care chains being forced to break up. “The message from our vets work so far has been loud and clear – many pet owners and professionals have concerns that need further investigation,” the CMA chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said. “We’ve heard from people who are struggling to pay vet bills, potentially overpaying for medicines and don’t always know the best treatment options available to them. We also remain concerned about the potential impact of sector consolidation and the incentives for large, integrated vet groups to act in ways which reduce consumer choice.” The investigation will also look at whether profits earned by vets were “consistent” with the levels expected in competitive markets, and if there was any incentive or ability to limit customer choices when recommending treatments or services – particularly when vets were part of larger groups. Overall, the regulator said the review would consider whether current rules are preventing the market from functioning as well as it could. If it finds poor practices, the CMA said it could end up forcing firms to provide certain information to consumers, imposing a maximum cap on prescription fees, or order the sale or disposal of businesses or assets. The CMA can also recommend that the government change the regulator’s powers. Cardell said: “While we’re aware of acute staff shortages and difficult working conditions for vets, we consider a formal market investigation is essential to ensure good outcomes for the millions of pet owners in the UK as well as professionals working in the sector. The independent inquiry group will now take this investigation forward.” The British Veterinary Association (BVA), which represents more than 19,000 vets across the UK, said it had already taken action on some of the CMA’s concerns, including issuing fresh guidance to members on making their fees and ownership structures more transparent. It also said an “urgent review” of the Veterinary Surgeons Act was needed, and said regulation of vet practices should be introduced. “As it stands, the legislation is not fit for purpose and is failing both vet teams and clients,” the BVA said. However, the BVA raised concerns about consumers taking out frustrations on veterinary staff. “As the CMA undertakes its investigation, it’s important to remember that vets genuinely care and prioritise the health and welfare of animals – it’s often their motivation for entering what is a highly pressured profession. “Since the CMA first announced their review, vet teams in practice have found themselves on the end of really unpleasant, often abusive behaviour. This is unacceptable and we urge everyone to remember that vets are people and are often not responsible for the pricing structures within a practice.” Responding to the CMA’s announcement, CVS – one of the UK’s six largest corporate vet groups – said it was looking forward to updates from the CMA, but stressed it had a “clear strategy with its purpose to give the best possible care to animals and its vision to be the veterinary company people most want to work for. The group is proud of the dedication and commitment of its colleagues in providing great care to its clients and their animals.” An initial review of the vet market by the CMA in September prompted 56,000 responses from pet owners and those working in the industry. The CMA will now set up an inquiry group of independent experts to oversee the investigation, which will be headed by its panel chair, Martin Coleman, a former partner of the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright.",

        "title": "National Grid taps shareholders to help fund £60bn low-carbon energy switch",
        "content": "National Grid has tapped shareholders for nearly £7bn to fund a £60bn spending spree to upgrade its networks to cope with the switch to low-carbon energy on either side of the Atlantic. The energy infrastructure company announced a £6.8bn rights issue – where existing shareholders are offered new shares – to provide fresh funds for investment in thousands of miles of cables to connect homes with renewable energy projects in the UK and the US. The company said nearly £60bn – to be spent between 2024 and 2029 – represented a “significant step-up” in investment, and double the figure of the previous five-year period. The plan includes £23bn spent in energy transmission in the UK to help expand offshore wind projects, as well as £8bn on “asset replacement, reinforcement and new connections”. It will spend a further £28bn ($35bn) in the US. Earlier this year, the group’s electricity system operator estimated that £54bn would need to be spent between now and 2030, and a further £58bn in the following five years, to meet government decarbonisation targets. The spending will add £20-£30 to customer bills. John Pettigrew, National Grid’s chief executive, said the fresh investment would add “single digit pounds” to bills, with the cost recovered over a period of up to 60 years. The switch away from gas-generated electricity to renewables would also reduce costs, “so ultimately, the overall bill to consumers will come down”, he said. National Grid said the fund would be spent on “critical energy infrastructure in the UK and US in support of the energy transition and economic growth objectives” but did not identify which projects it would invest in. However, projects announced under its “Great Grid Upgrade” plan last year are likely to receive funds. These include a proposal for two offshore high voltage electricity links between Scotland and England and a planned project to upgrade existing power lines in East Anglia and Essex. Pettigrew said: “As economies become increasingly digital, electrified and decarbonised, the need for energy infrastructure has rarely been more pressing. “Our investment will unlock significant economic growth and, by the end of the decade, National Grid is expected to support over 60,000 more jobs, while also decarbonising our energy systems, bolstering security of supply, and reducing consumer bills in the long term.” In the US, the firm is spending $4bn on an “upstate upgrade”, involving more than 70 projects to modernise the network north and west of New York City. The £60bn investment plan will be funded by the largest rights issue in Europe for 15 years outside the banking sector, by tapping the debt markets, and by selling its liquified natural gas terminal on the Isle of Grain, east of London. It also plans to sell its US onshore wind and solar business, but remains interested investing in US offshore wind projects. The spending on Britain’s electricity network will draw fresh focus on Labour and the Conservatives’ energy transition plans. The government has committed to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 and Labour by 2030. Pettigrew said the two sets of plans were “ambitious” and the company was speaking to both parties. Separately, the network company said its pre-tax profits had fallen by 15% to £3bn in the year to 31 March. Its board recommended a £2.17bn dividend. Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: “The energy network and transmission firms, like National Grid, have hidden out of the headlines for too long. The huge profits being generated by these firms are paid for off the backs of people living in fuel poverty.”",

        "content": "Three Australians remain in intensive care in a Bangkok hospital after their Singapore Airlines flight violently dropped when flying through severe turbulence earlier this week. The three Australians are among 20 passengers from the flight who are being treated in intensive care at the Samitivej Srinakarin hospital in Bangkok, after flight SQ321 from London to Singapore on Tuesday hit turbulence, leaving a 73-year-old British man dead and prompting an emergency diversion to the Thai capital. Six Britons, six Malaysians, two Singaporeans and one person each from Hong Kong, New Zealand and the Philippines were also in intensive care, authorities said. Nine of the 20 passengers in ICU had undergone surgery while five more were awaiting surgery. Outside of ICU, there were at least a further nine Australians reported as remaining in hospitals in Bangkok. An Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said there were 12 Australians and one permanent resident in hospital in Bangkok. One other Australian had been discharged. Many of those in hospital had head injuries, according to Thai officials. An Adelaide man onboard the flight said his wife could be in Samitivej Srinakarin hospital for weeks, and “wasn’t in a good way”, according to the ABC. The man, who was not identified, said she had been standing up when the plane suddenly dropped. Of the 211 passengers and 18 crew who had been onboard the Boeing 777, 79 passengers and six crew remained in Bangkok, with the majority of those in hospital, the chief executive of Singapore Airlines, Goh Choon Phong, said. Aviation investigators arrived in the city on Wednesday to begin examining the incident, with the US National Transportation Safety Board also sending technical advisors because of the involvement of a Boeing plane. Meanwhile, passengers from the flight who were well enough to travel began leaving Bangkok, including 131 who left on a special flight to Singapore on Wednesday. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Josh Silverstone, a 24-year-old passenger from south London, was discharged from hospital with a cut in his eye and a chipped tooth. He recalled waking up on the floor of the plane. “I ... didn’t realise what happened. I must have got hit in the head somewhere. Lots of people hit their head. Everyone was bleeding,” Silverstone, who had been on his way to Singapore before a holiday in Bali with friends, told Reuters. “I arrived back in the airport and I couldn’t stop vomiting. I couldn’t walk, it was pretty bad,” Silverstone told the Associated Press. He said he was so scared that he bought in-flight internet access to message his mother: “I wasn’t trying to scare her, but I said ‘I love you.’” Silverstone said: “A lot of people have got spinal issues from hitting their heads, I’ve heard a lot of people can barely move their back, I’m very fortunate to come out here barely 24 hours later.” Beverley Mayers, who was not injured, described the situation inside the plane as “sheer terror”. “The whole plane was shuddering ... great pieces were falling off and dropping on the floor, people getting hit in the head,” she told Channel Nine after arriving at Sydney airport. Newlyweds Ali and Ramiza Bukhari, who were flying back from their honeymoon, told reporters at Sydney airport they were relieved to be back home. “It was a very, very traumatic experience,” Ali Bukhari said. Flight attendants had been serving breakfast at the time. Coffee and cups of water were thrown into the air, and people’s phones, shoes and cushions were flung around. Photographs of the inside of the cabin showed oxygen masks and panels hanging from the ceiling, and the floor covered in food and drinks, with luggage scattered. Patches of blood stained the cabin carpets. One passenger told Reuters overhead plastic panels had been broken by the impact of people’s heads slamming into them.",

        "content": "The number of gas and electricity smart meters that are not working properly is likely to be higher than government figures suggest – possibly 20% to 30% of the total – according to research from Citizens Advice. The charity said millions of households were missing out on the promised benefits from smart meters due to “problems with technology” and poor supplier customer service. Smart meters are seen as an important part of the transition to net zero as they allow homeowners to more easily track their energy use and take steps to reduce consumption. They send real-time data on customer usage to suppliers remotely when in “smart mode”. But the technology’s introduction has been slow and bumpy, and last year, parliament’s public accounts committee said ministers had not done enough to convince households of their benefits. In March, data from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero showed that, at the end of last year, 3.98m meters in Great Britain were not working properly – or had “temporarily lost smart functionality”, to use the official terminology. That figure represents a little more than 10% of the 34.8m smart meters in homes and businesses. However, Citizens Advice said its research suggested this was “just the tip of the iceberg”. It said a poll carried out between August and October 2023 involving 4,000 domestic energy consumers across the UK showed that 20% of households with a smart meter still had to regularly submit manual meter readings because their device was not doing so automatically. Almost one-third (31%) of those polled said they had experienced problems with their meter’s in-home display – the screen that helps people track their energy usage and costs. In addition, a quarter of people who asked Citizens Advice for help with smart meter issues had billing problems. The charity said it was particularly worried that people could end up with “huge unexpected bills” if their supplier was not able to take an automatic reading for an extended period of time. Meter problems have led to some households racking up debt due to readings not being sent automatically. In some cases, “catchup bills” running into four figures had been sent to customers after meters went unchecked by suppliers for more than a year, said a spokesperson for the organisation. Citizens Advice said its data indicated millions of households were being “let down” by meter problems that suppliers were failing to fix. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said its statistics showed the vast majority of the meters installed – almost 90% – were working in smart mode. “Energy suppliers are required to keep their customers’ meters working, and Ofgem is responsible for regulating them against this requirement,” they added. “Any issues with smart meters and in-home display screens should be addressed promptly, and we will soon announce plans to drive better service for new and existing smart meter customers.”",

        "title": "Things can only get better? For Sunak and the UK economy, this might be as good as it gets",
        "content": "When you are 20 or so points behind in the opinion polls calling an election before you need to do so is a high-risk strategy. Yet Rishi Sunak has decided that holding on until the autumn is an even bigger gamble. The economy decides elections, and as far as the prime minister is concerned, this could be as good as it gets. Sunak has only come to this view recently. After sliding into a shallow recession at the end of 2023, the economy has only just returned to growth. Living standards – which took a hammering during the cost of living crisis – have been picking up. Inflation has fallen from a high of 11.1% in October 2022 to 2.3%, only just above its target. But the economy has only just turned the corner and there was a strong case for playing it long so that the government could point to further evidence of recovery. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, certainly thought as much, and the Treasury was already working on plans for a pre-election autumn statement. Plan A was for the chancellor to announce a cut in national insurance contribution (NICs) in September, allowing Sunak to announce the date of a November election at the Conservative party conference. That plan has now been junked. Plan B involves convincing voters that a fledgling recovery is for real and that Britain’s “hard-won stability” (a phrase Sunak will use repeatedly during the election campaign) will be jeopardised by a Labour victory. So what’s changed? First, some of the recent news has been better than expected. Growth in the first three months of 2024 was 0.6% and surveys have suggested improvement will continue into the second quarter. Both business and consumer confidence have picked up. In its annual assessment of the state of the economy, the International Monetary Fund said a deep recession had been avoided and a soft landing was in prospect. Second, the latest annual inflation figures – while showing a sharp fall from 3.2% in March to 2.3% in April – were not as good as the Bank of England and the financial markets were expecting. Headline inflation is expected to remain close to the government’s 2% target for the next few months but is likely to start rising gently in the autumn. Service sector inflation, which is closely monitored by the Bank as a proxy for price pressures generated by the domestic economy, is proving harder to shift, and is running at 5.9%. As a result, the Bank is likely to be cautious about cutting interest rates. A speech this week by Ben Broadbent, one of its deputy governors, was seen as pointing to a cut in the cost of borrowing in June, but the release of the inflation figures altered the mood. The City now sees little chance of a rate cut next month and thinks there is only a 50% chance of one at the next meeting of the Bank’s monetary policy committee in early August. That will have a knock-on effect on mortgage rates, hurting those whose fixed-rate mortgages expire this year. The longer Sunak delays the election, the more households will be affected. Third, the state of the public finances means there is no real room for tax cuts this autumn. Although the IMF had some good news for the government, it also said there was no scope for giveaways and indeed pointed to a looming £30bn hole that needed to be filled. The IMF’s warning was given added weight by the latest Office for National Statistics figures showing the government borrowed more than £20bn in April – more than in April last year and more than the independent Office for Budget Responsibility predicted at the time of the March budget. To sum up, hopes of households benefiting from multiple pre-election cuts in mortgage rates have faded. Hunt has been forced to recognise that there is no money for tax cuts. The economy, by recent standards, has been doing tolerably well. So why wait?",

        "content": "Virgin Money shareholders have voted in favour of a £2.9bn takeover by rival lender Nationwide Building Society, helping clear the path for the biggest UK banking deal since the financial crisis. Just over 89% of voting shareholders said yes to the deal at a general meeting on Wednesday, while nearly 11% rejected the move. The resolution required at least 75% backing to pass. There had been some uncertainty over the size of opposition that Virgin Money might face, after Australian fund manager Allan Gray, which holds a 10% stake, hit out at the 220p a share offer, saying earlier this month that they were “disappointed” with the price, and that the takeover was “likely to sell shareholders very short”. However, Virgin Money secured backing from its largest investor, Sir Richard Branson, whose Virgin Group confirmed early on that it would back the takeover, which will result in a £724m windfall for the billionaire businessman. That sum includes the sale of Branson’s 14.5% stake in the bank, which he founded in 1995, as well as £310m for the privilege of using – and eventually disposing of – the Virgin brand. Nationwide will pay £15m in annual royalties to Virgin Group to use the brand name over the first four years, before paying £250m to exit the contract, and eventually phase out Virgin Money’s name entirely. The shareholder vote clears a notable hurdle for the takeover, though it will still require formal approval from City regulators the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority. The lenders will also need signoff from the Competition and Markets Authority, and Virgin Money will have to cancel listings on the London and the Australian stock exchanges, with the deal likely to be completed in the final three months of the year. Nationwide has stopped short of offering its own members a vote on the deal – citing regulations including the 1986 Building Societies Act, which does not require a society to hold a vote if it is buying a business that looks roughly like its own. It has said its hands are also tied by UK takeover rules that suggest a bidder cannot make an offer that would hinge on it holding a vote it is not required to. The acquisition will solidify Nationwide’s position as the UK’s second-largest mortgage lender, led by chief executive Debbie Crosbie. Crosbie already has links to the takeover target, having previously served as chief operating officer at the bank, which was previously known as Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group before the lender bought Virgin Money for £1.7bn, and started using its name, in 2018.",

        "title": "M&S’s revival is the real deal – don’t mess it up again",
        "content": "It is three years exactly since Archie Norman, the chair, said he’d spotted “green shoots” of recovery at Marks &amp; Spencer, and, after a delay caused by the cost of living blight, a bloom has indeed appeared. Pre-tax profits rose 41% last year to £672m (or 58% to £716m ignoring “adjusting” items). Chief executive Stuart Machin, switching the metaphors from botanical to nautical, reckons there is “wind in our sails”. The performance is definitely radically improved. The only real blemishes were in the international division, where the collection of overseas franchises and partnerships seems to have been an afterthought to the self-help programme at home, and at the joint venture with Ocado in food, which is producing the familiar sight of lively sales growth but bottom-line losses. The rest, though, is flying. After the hard grind of fixing logistics and so forth under his predecessor, Machin has sharpened the prices and the product offer. Market share in food, home and clothing is on the up. It also helps that M&amp;S finally accepted years ago that it had to get out of so many underperforming second- and third-tier stores in the age of online shopping. Such “full-line” outlets used to number 320, are now down to 240 and the eventual target is 180, with relocations to better sites also being part of the mix. All the while, the number of food-only venues continues to be expanded. Very good: the shares rose 5% to 288p as City analysts upgraded profit forecasts. But before M&amp;S shareholders get too carried away, they should remember that their company has had at least two moments in its 25-year struggle for re-invention when the bosses of the time thought they’d cracked it. Back in 2007, profits of £1bn were briefly glimpsed again and chief executive Stuart Rose said M&amp;S was “once again setting the pace” in UK retailing. The post-2008 recession crushed that illusion. Then, in 2016, Marc Bolland bowed out by claiming to have “done the heavy lifting” when he hadn’t. Two years later, Norman was talking about being on “a burning platform”. There are, though, a few reasons for thinking the latest revival is the real deal. First, M&amp;S has now clocked up 12 consecutive quarters of sales growth in food and non-food, which suggests a genuine turning point was reached. Second, Debenhams has disappeared from high streets and John Lewis’s recovery has barely begun. Third, M&amp;S’s ongoing store “rotation” programme should continue to be a benefit. Fourth, the balance sheet – the strongest since 1997, reckons the company, after two years of strong cashflow – can plainly deal with any minor relapses. Fifth, Machin is frank that M&amp;S still needs to invest more in its digital operations. Sixth, the international headaches look fixable. None of which guarantees a multi-year winning run, but a bracing encounter with a true crisis in the Covid period, when the shares dipped below 100p, may have been beneficial ultimately. It seemed to produce greater commercial ruthlessness on costs and prices, for example. It should have happened years ago.",

        "title": "Anglo American rejects BHP’s third takeover offer of £38.6bn ",
        "content": "Anglo American has rebuffed a third takeover attempt by BHP after the Australian company sweetened its offer in an attempt to create a global mining titan. BHP said it had submitted an “increased and final” bid of £31.11 a share for Anglo, which values the FTSE 100 company at £38.6bn, earlier this week. Anglo had already rejected two previous offers from BHP: the first, in April, valued it at £31bn and the second, which was snubbed last week, put it at £34bn. The attempted BHP takeover, the largest ever in the mining sector, would create a global player in markets for commodities including copper, iron ore, potash and metallurgical coal used for steelmaking. Copper in particular is in high demand as a raw material in the transition to low-carbon energy as it is used in manufacturing components for electric vehicles and renewable energy projects. Anglo’s key assets are copper mines in Chile and Peru. After the two previous rejections, BHP said it had been “engaging with Anglo American and its advisers” to allay concerns over the deal and that it was hopeful that resolution would be reached in the next seven days. Mike Henry, the chief executive of BHP, said: “The revised proposal is underpinned by BHP’s disciplined approach to mergers and acquisition and our focus on delivering long term fundamental value. “BHP’s revised proposal will offer immediate value for Anglo American shareholders and allow them to benefit from the long-term value generation of the combined group.” BHP’s attempt to snap up Anglo could still be gatecrashed by a rival. The Swiss mining company Glencore has reportedly been considering its own approach. BHP’s terms require that Anglo sells its stakes in Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore, returning cash to shareholders as part of the deal. Even if BHP is unsuccessful, Anglo’s chief executive, Duncan Wanblad, has pledged to break up the business and sell its platinum division and its De Beers diamond arm. Stuart Chambers, the chair of Anglo American, said: “The board considered BHP’s latest proposal carefully, concluded it does not meet expectations of value delivered to Anglo American’s shareholders, and has unanimously rejected it.” Chambers said its board was “confident in Anglo American’s standalone future prospects” and that BHP had not addressed the board’s concerns about the complex terms of the takeover. “Multiple engagements with the BHP team have not yet been able to resolve the concerns on these issues,” he said. Anglo received a boost this week when one of its largest shareholders, Legal &amp; General Investment Management, backed the FTSE 100 miner’s break-up plan, calling it a “radical but attractive strategy”. The South African government is Anglo’s largest shareholder through its Public Investment Corporation (PIC) and home to many of its mines. The PIC has so far been unimpressed by BHP’s takeover attempts and said on Wednesday before the latest bid was made that the previous offer needed “meaningful revision”. BHP had until 5pm on Wednesday to make an improved offer or walk away for six months under City takeover rules. Anglo said the deadline has now been extended until 29 May.",

        "title": "Raising jobseeker is not 'fiscally sustainable’? Sorry, but that is flat out wrong | Greg Jericho",
        "content": "On Monday the Productivity Commission released its snapshot of inequality report. As a “snapshot”, the report is just presenting the current situation rather than offering solutions. But unfortunately, it also perpetuates the lie that inequality and poverty is beyond our ability to fix. It took only two paragraphs for warning bells to start ringing in my ears. On the opening page, the commission notes “the initial period of the pandemic saw an unprecedented fall in income inequality”. This of course did not happen by accident but “as a result of the significant increase in support payments from the Australian Government”. These increases “included the Coronavirus Supplement, which was paid to income support recipients, such as those receiving JobSeeker and Youth Allowance”. All good so far. The government increased payments $550 a fortnight and it caused “an unprecedented fall in income inequality”. But then comes the kicker. The Productivity Commission states with a misguided certainty that only comes from a lifetime of adherence to the God of small government and market forces that these payments were “not fiscally sustainable in the long term”. Excuse me? Not fiscally sustainable? Sorry, but that is just flat out wrong. And irresponsibly so. There is no budgetary or economic reason that makes increasing jobseeker (or other payments) by $550 “not fiscally sustainable”. Let’s do some comparisons. In 2024-25, the government is expected to forgo $28bn in revenue because of tax concessions on superannuation contributions, $15.2bn of which goes to the top 20% of income earners. The government will also forgo $21.3bn through tax concessions for superannuation earnings, $12.1bn of which goes to the top 20%. I await the commission suggesting this is fiscally unsustainable. It also costs the government $15.5bn to provide a 50% capital gains discount – and $13.6bn of that goes to the richest 20%. Fiscally unsustainable? Next year the government has budgeted to provide $10.2bn in fuel tax credits, the vast majority of which goes to mining companies – hardly those who are doing it tough. But not fiscally unsustainable it seems. So how much would it cost to raise jobseeker by $550 a fortnight? Using the Parliamentary Budget Office’s build your own budget tool, we can calculate that it would cost about $9.7bn next year. If the graph does not display click here So let’s stop with the view that inequality cannot be improved. We know how to do it. In 2020 the government chose to do it, and since then governments have chosen not to do it but have instead kept choosing to hand the richest 10% nearly $13bn a year in tax discounts on their profits when they sell their investment properties and the like. This choice is even more stark given that the Productivity Commission’s report reveals that, while inequality fell during the pandemic, it has risen quickly since then. If the graph does not display click here Even taking into account the increased assistance during the pandemic, the richest 10% did the best over the three years from 2018-19 to 2021-22. We see this as well in the measure of inequality known as the Gini coefficient. The level of inequality this century was lowest in 2020-21 during the pandemic, and in 2022-23 it hit the highest level: If the graph does not display click here Nothing about this is surprising. And we should never allow anyone to confuse us about why this is happening. Inequality is reduced when those on low incomes get more (dare we say, appropriate) assistance. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Productivity Commission notes that “taxes and transfers significantly reduce inequality by equalising incomes across the distribution”. This is obvious across the entire world. But Australia is one of the worst at doing it. Before taxes and transfers (things like jobseeker and the age pension), Australia is the 11th most equal economy among the OECD. But after taxes and transfers, when comparing actual household disposable incomes, Australia falls to the 20th most equal. If the graph does not display click here The tragedy is our tax and transfer system is actually very efficient at reducing poverty. But we just don’t do enough. Or to be more accurate, the government chooses to not do enough. Remember that Australia has the lowest relative unemployment assistance of any nation in the OECD and increasing it by $550 a fortnight would not even get us to the OECD average: If the graph does not display click here And this is not a natural order of things – governments since around 1996 have chosen to make life relatively harder for the unemployed than in other rich economies: If the graph does not display click here The Productivity Commission’s snapshot is a welcome addition to the policy debate around inequality and poverty – it contains much needed inflation. After all you can’t improve what you don’t measure. But let us not pretend the solutions are unknown. The government knows how to do it. The government did it in 2020. It worked. Never fall for the line that reducing inequality or lifting people out of poverty is a task that is either too complex or costly for us to undertake.

        "content": "Our main stories today: Anglo American has rebuffed a third takeover attempt by Australia’s BHP after it sweetened its offer in an attempt to create a global mining titan.

UK inflation fell to 2.3% in April – its lowest level for almost three years – but the decline was smaller than expected, denting hopes of an early interest rate cut. City analysts had forecast the annual increase in the cost of goods and services would fall to 2.1%, close to the Bank of England’s 2% target. Markets responded by trimming their predictions that the Bank would cut rates from their current 5.25% level as early as next month, with forecasts of a reduction in August also scaled back.

Breaking: Australia’s BHP has sweetened its offer to buy rival Anglo American, a deal that would create a global mining giant, but that third takeover proposal was swiftly rejected. BHP’s all-share share offer is worth £31.11 per Anglo American share based on the 22 April closing price, it said. It values the company at £38.6bn. Anglo said the latest proposal valued its shares at £29.34 based on the 23 April closing price. It has agreed to enter talks with its larger rival – although BHP has described its offer as “final”. Anglo had rejected two previous offers from BHP: the first, in April, valued it at £31bn and the second at £34bn, which was snubbed earlier this month. BHP hopes ink the takeover the FTSE 100 company – the largest ever in the mining sector – to create a global player in markets for commodities including copper, iron ore, potash and metallurgical coal used for steelmaking, my colleague Alex Lawson reports. Copper in particular is in high demand as a raw material in the transition to low carbon energy as it is used in manufacturing components for electric vehicles and renewable energy projects. Anglo American’s key assets are copper mines in Chile and Peru. Labour has accused the government of indulging in a “tone deaf victory lap” after UK inflation hit its lowest level in nearly three years. Treasury minister Bim Afolami, making a statement to the Commons, said: The ONS data released today shows that CPI inflation has fallen to 2.3%, a return to normal levels last seen before the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this week the IMF said the UK economy is approaching a soft landing and it upgraded its forecast for UK growth in 2024. Having seen lower inflation accompanied by stronger than expected growth in the first quarter, these developments are proof that the Government’s plan is working, that the difficult decisions we have taken are paying off and the UK economy really is beginning to turn the corner. Afolami added: Now is not the time to change course because when it comes to Labour’s policies on jobs, welfare reform and tax, we know the difference if they’re elected will be profound and damaging for every family in this country. But shadow Treasury minister Tulip Siddiq said: Of course it is welcome that the rate of inflation is finally slowing after three years of the Government missing every single target. But, to be frank, the tone deaf victory lap we are seeing from the government today will feel like a slap in the face to the British people who after 14 years of Conservative chaos are still significantly worse off. Meanwhile, the former chief executive of the Post Office, Paula Vennells, has broken down in tears mid-evidence to the Horizon inquiry, as she apologised for telling MPs the Post Office was successful in every court case against subpostmasters, during a morning session in which she also said she does not think there was a conspiracy, but that mistakes were made. It is the first time she has appeared before the Horizon inquiry, and she will be questioned further in the days to come. You can follow the latest on the hearing here: Here’s our full story on inflation: … and some analysis: The annual inflation rate fell sharply in April. Prices are rising more slowly than at any time in almost three years. Inflation is lower in the UK than it is in the EU. Even so, the latest bulletin on the cost of living from the Office for National Statistics was mildly disappointing. April’s inflation figure was always going to be good, with a sharp fall guaranteed by the fact the energy price increases of a year earlier were not repeated. But at 2.3%, the number was slightly higher than expected. The consensus among economists polled by Reuters was 2.1%. Some had even predicted it would drop below the government’s 2% target. Three years of pain: how inflation drove the UK cost of living crisis Giles Mackay, founder of the property data firm Outra said about the latest 8.9% annual rise in UK private rents: With rental costs increasing over the last decade, the pressure is mounting for policymakers and the private sector. They must work together not only to deliver more units but deliver them in the areas where need is greatest if they want to help solve the affordability crisis. Meanwhile, house prices appear to be stabilising after a period of contraction, further diverging the economic fortunes of homeowners and private renters. Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chancellor of the exchequer, said on X this morning: The latest official UK house price and rent figures are out. Average home prices climbed by 1.8% in March, the first annual increase since last June, according to the Office for National Statistics. Average private rents rose by an annual rate of 8.9% in April, down from 9.2% in March but still high – bringing little reprieve for renters. Government borrowing rose to £20.5bn last month, the fourth-highest April figure on record, and the highest borrowing since April 2021, as we reported earlier. Public sector receipts grew by £1.6bn compared with April last year, but this growth was outstripped by a £3.1bn jump in spending. The Office for National Statistics has increased its estimate of borrowing in the financial year ending March by £800m to £121.4bn, now £7.3bn more than the £114.1bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The UK’s net debt at the end of April, excluding the banking bailout during the financial crisis, was 97.9% of gross domestic product – this was 2.5 percentage points more than at the end of April 2023, and remains at levels last seen in the early 1960s. Alex Kerr, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said: April’s public finances figures got the new 2024/25 fiscal year off to a shaky start and cast further doubt on the chancellor’s ability to unveil big tax cuts at another pre-election fiscal event later this year. Overall, the chancellor will be disappointed that April’s figures do not provide more scope for tax cuts at a fiscal event later this year. Moreover, we expect slower nominal GDP growth and wage growth to dampen tax receipts growth later this year. And the rise in market interest rates since March’s budget alone suggests he may have even less fiscal ‘headroom’ (perhaps about £6.5bn) for tax cuts than the £8.9bn left over in March. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff has listened to Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, talking about inflation on the BBC radio 4 Today programme. He said: It is good news that inflation is now lower than in the eurozone or in the United States of America [inflation is 2.4% in the eurozone and 3.4% in the US], but prices are still a lot higher than they were a year ago so I think it will take time for that pressure to ease on family budgets. But when we’re talking about the future I think what people will be heartened by is yesterday the International Monetary Fund confirmed that they believe that the UK economy will grow faster over the next six years than France, Germany, Italy or Japan… But that doesn’t mean that people at home will be feeling immediately better because we’ve been through a very, very difficult period with a pandemic and energy crisis… Question: “…And your government. We had Liz Truss for just a few days and some of the shocks are still being felt by more than a million who will be coming out of their mortgages this year and having to pay much higher prices.” Hunt responded: Well I accept that mistakes were made… Q: “More than mistakes, Mr Hunt.” The chancellor said: Well let me answer the question. Mistakes were made and I corrected those mistakes and Rishi Sunak did, as one of the first things we did. But it is wrong to say that the pressures that people are feeling, the majority of those pressures are from those short period…the point I’m making is that living standards have fallen by more in Germany, Austria or Sweden and so the majority of what people are feeling is the result of a global pandemic and an energy shock. And in an election year, what I will be saying is those difficult decisions – which mean going actually back to 2010 that we’ve created more jobs than nearly anywhere else in Europe. That’s happened because conservative governments have taken difficult decisions on a flexible labour market, on getting down taxes, on welfare reform. We reported yesterday that Hunt is preparing a pre-election cut in national insurance despite a warning from the International Monetary Fund of a looming £30bn hole in the public finances, Downing Street has indicated. David Hollingworth, associate director at the mortgage broker L&amp;C Mortgages, said: It’s good news to see the headline rate of inflation drop back so much closer to the Bank of England target rate of 2% but at 2.3% it may also bring some disappointment for those looking for signs of an imminent cut to base rate. The figures are at the higher end of forecasts and could see expectations for base rate to hold at a higher level for longer yet. Mortgage rates have eased back a touch in recent weeks, but today’s figures may well hold back the chance for that to become a stronger trend. A big fall in inflation was already expected and therefore already priced into fixed rates. Mortgage borrowers may have to wait a little longer for base rate to fall and the recent ups and downs in mortgage rates should underline the ongoing uncertainty. Holding off in the hope of rates dropping could make for a bumpy ride for homeowners. Here is more reaction to the inflation data, from Paula Bejarano Carbo, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a respected think tank. The FTSE 100 index has fallen 0.6% and is set for its biggest daily drop in a month, after UK inflation slowed less than expected in April, both the headline and core rates. Services inflation was also higher than expected, and markets have scaled back rate cut expectations. European indices are also drifting lower, with the Dax in Frankfurt and the CAC in Paris both down 0.3%. The pound rose 0.4% after the inflation numbers, and is still trading 0.3% higher at $1.2748. The shares of UK housebuilders are down, including Persimmon, Barratt and Taylor Wimpey, with hopes of an early interest rate cut dashed. Bucking the trend in London is Marks &amp; Spencer, the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, up 7.5%. It increased annual profits by 41% which was better than expected, but also warned it will ramp up cost cuts in the year ahead. Our retail correspondent Sarah Butler reports: Stuart Machin, the boss of the clothing, homewares and food retailer, said it was “at the beginnings of a new M&amp;S” with “wind in our sails, and confidence that our plan is working” as pretax profits rose to £672.5m in the year to 30 March. Sales rose 9.4% to £13bn. He said M&amp;S had increased its market share in both clothing and homewares and was “confident we will make further progress” in a bullish prediction for the year ahead. The upmarket grocer said it had benefited from a shift towards eating at home rather than at restaurants with sales of its ‘dine in’ offer up by more than 40% while shoppers were also spent 34% more on its lowest price “Remarksable Value” range. Clothing and home sales rose 5.3%, helped by a 15% rise in sales of holiday gear such as swimsuits while sales of its more expensive Autograph range for men rose 15%. There is still “much more to be done” to drive down inflation, Labour’s Darren Jones said, pointing to energy measures which could prevent inflationary spikes in the UK in future. The shadow Treasury minister said inflation had “come down a bit” when speaking to Sky News, but said this was “largely driven by a drop in the energy price cap”. Core inflation – which strips out volatile things like food and energy – came in at 3.9% in April, down from 4.2% in March. Jones said this is hotter than the markets were expecting it to be (3.6%). This is not out of the woods yet. It is in the right direction but there is still much more to be done. Jones pointed to Labour’s “securonomics” agenda, which includes measures to build “homegrown, secure, renewable energy”. The shadow minister said: “ The one reason that the headline rate of inflation has come down closer to 2% today even though the cost of other things are remaining a bit too high is because of the energy bills. The problem there is if something happens in the world and gas prices rocket again, we are going to be back into that inflationary environment with very high bills. Financial markets have scaled back their expectations for an interest rate cut in June, and August is also looking slightly less likely. They are forecasting a reduction by September, though. Before today’s inflation data, which showed services inflation is more stubborn than expected, markets had fully priced in two rate cuts this year, one by August and another one before the end of the year. Investors are now split on whether there will be a second reduction. The probability of a June rate cut is now seen at less than 15%. Despite the slowdown in inflation, the cost of living crisis is not over, according to Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). Nowak said: The cost-of-living crisis is not over - no matter how much ministers pretend it is. Prices are still going up. Food and energy bills are much higher than a couple of years ago. And many are being hit by soaring mortgage repayments. While Nowak welcomed the lower rate of inflation he added that “millions up and down the country are still having to cut back on everyday essentials”. That’s because household budgets have been decimated by the highest price rises in the G7 and wages have flatlined over the last 14 years. Pay packets are still worth less today than in 2008, with working people on course to end this Parliament poorer than at the start. Make no mistake - the Tories have delivered the worst period for living standards in generations. However, despite the record fall in energy costs and lower food prices, services inflation – the single most important indicator for the Bank of England – came in at 5.9%, much higher than analysts had expected (5.4%) or the Bank’s own forecast (5.5%). This reduces the chances of an interest rate cut at the June meeting, said James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, but noted that services inflation can be volatile and May’s figures should give a better idea of where inflation is headed. We’ve long felt that this reading had the potential to be highly volatile owing to a multitude of annual price hikes that kick in at the start of the financial year, and that’s exactly what we’ve seen. We saw a very similar surprise last April, and much like then, we’ve seen a highly unusual and significant spike in rents. Last year this was subsequently revealed to be linked to social rents, which the ONS updates once per quarter in the index. That seems to explain much of the surprise, but there were sizeable month-on-month increases in a range of other service-sector categories too. Importantly, this doesn’t tell us too much about the trajectory of inflation – by definition much of this is linked to one-off annual price adjustments. This time last year, markets wrongly inferred from the April figures that the UK was in a more serious situation when it came to inflation than other economies. It would be a mistake to assume something similar again, and May’s figures should be more predictable. Turning to interest rates, he said: The figures therefore aren’t a total game-changer for the Bank of England which will look at the numbers and see more noise than signal. But we think it does reduce the chances of a rate cut at June’s meeting, even though we’ll get another set of data before that decision. We certainly wouldn’t rule it out though. The Bank is visibly divided and with very few media appearances by the internal committee members, it’s frankly impossible to know how the deciding votes are likely to be cast. However, today’s data supports our long-held base case that the first rate cut will come in August, which offers the BoE an extra inflation print to be more confident about the underlying trend. For now, we’re sticking with that. Rishi Sunak has also commented on the inflation figures, saying: Today marks a major moment for the economy, with inflation back to normal. This is proof that the plan is working and that the difficult decisions we have taken are paying off. Brighter days are ahead, but only if we stick to the plan to improve economic security and opportunity for everyone. Let’s dig a bit deeper into the inflation figures. The ONS said it was the lowest annual inflation rate for electricity, gas and other fuels on record. Prices of electricity, gas and other fuels fell by 27.1% in the year to April, the largest drop since records started in 1989. Gas prices fell by 37.5% on the year, compared with a fall of 26.5% in March, while electricity prices fell by 21%, compared with 13% in March. In other good news for consumers, food prices slowed to the lowest annual rate since November 2021. Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 2.9% in the year to April, down from 4% in March. The rate has eased for the 13th consecutive month from a recent peak of 19.2% in March 2023, the highest annual rate seen for over 45 years. The main downward effects came from a combination of bread and cereals, meat, dairy products, vegetables, and soft drinks. In each case, the annual rate was the lowest seen for at least two years. The annual rate eased in eight of the 11 food and non-alcoholic beverages classes, the exceptions being oils and fats, fish, and hot beverages. The inflation figures are a bit of a disappointment for the chancellor Jeremy Hunt. And the public finance figures aren’t good either. The government borrowed £20.5bn last month, the fourth-highest April borrowing since monthly records began in 1993. Borrowing – the difference between public sector spending and income – was £1.5bn more than in April 2023 and £1.2bn more than the £19.3bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Factory gate prices rose by an annual rate of 1.1% in April, up from 0.7% in March, the ONS also said. Producer prices eventually feed through to consumer prices. The Bank of England and the Office of Budget Responsibility are forecasting that inflation will fall to around 2% by early summer. An HM Treasury spokesperson said about today’s data: We rightly protected millions of jobs during Covid and paid half of people’s energy bills after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine sent bills skyrocketing – but it wouldn’t be fair to leave future generations to pick up the tab. That’s why we must stick to the plan to get debt falling. The economy is turning a corner, with strong growth this quarter and inflation close to target, allowing us to cut taxes for the average worker by £900 a year. Inflation in the UK has slowed to an annual rate of 2.3%, down from 3.2% in March, on lower energy costs. Economists had expected a larger slowdown to 2.1%. March’s slowdown was also not as big as expected. The Office for National Statistics said: Falling gas and electricity prices resulted in the largest downward contributions to the monthly change in both CPIH and CPI annual rates, while the largest, partially offsetting, upward contribution came from motor fuels, with prices rising this year but falling a year ago. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Inflation in the UK is expected to have slowed further, to an annual rate of 2.1% in April from 3.2% in March, figures from the Office for National Statistics are expected to show at 7am BST. Investec economist Ellie Henderson explains: 1 April is frequently referred to as ‘National Price Hike Day’ due to firms and governments often increasing prices at the start of the new financial year. For example, in April we traditionally see price hikes in TV, broadband, train fares and water bills. But for inflation, what is key is the size of the monthly increase relative to last year. Although many consumers experienced large price rises in April, for the most part, these were smaller increases than last year, and thus will subtract from inflation. As such, we have many downward influences on inflation. But the largest by far stems from gas and electricity prices. In February Ofgem announced that its energy price cap would fall by 12% in April. This feeds mechanically into the inflation calculation and knocks 0.4 percentage points off headline inflation. But this effect is already baked in the pie, so to speak. The Bank of England knew when making its forecasts as part of the May Monetary Policy Report that there would be a large push lower due to energy. There are questions how prices in other sectors evolve, particularly within services, where inflation has remained particularly stubborn. Labour costs are key to this, and these would have risen for many firms in April due to the near 10% rise in the National Living Wage. We will also get UK public finance data for April at the same time. Later this morning, the former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells will testify to the long-running Horizon inquiry. It is a moment wrongly convicted post office operators have waited years for. The inquiry is looking into how hundreds were pursued in the courts, fined and jailed over accounting shortfalls that were actually the fault of the Horizon IT system. Vennells, who held the top job between 2012 and 2019, has become the highest-profile face of the scandal since the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office galvanised public opinion when it was screened in January – despite her keeping a low public profile in the past decade. Jane Croft has looked at the key questions Vennells must answer. You can watch the hearing live here. The Agenda 10am BST: Former Post Office CEO Paula Vennells to appear before Horizon inquiry 9.30am BST: UK house prices/rents for April 5pm BST: Deadline for BHP to make a firm offer for Anglo American or walk away 7pm BST: US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee minutes",

        "title": "Severn Trent increases payout to shareholders despite its 60,000 sewage spills last year",
        "content": "Severn Trent has increased its payout to shareholders despite being responsible for 60,000 sewage spills last year. Severn hiked its final dividend by 9% to 70.1p a share after pre-tax profits swelled almost 20% to £201.3m in the year to the end of March. The dividend increase risks angering MPs, campaigners and the public amid an outcry over English water firms handing large payouts to investors while polluting waterways, hiking bills and awarding large pay packets to executives. Severn, which serves 4.6m households and businesses from the Bristol Channel to the Humber, and mid-Wales to the east Midlands, was responsible for more than 60,000 sewage spills last year – a one-third increase from almost 45,000 in 2022 – with those spills lasting for more than 440,000 hours. Earlier this year, Severn Trent was fined more than £2m for polluting the River Trent near Stoke between November 2019 and February 2020. Its boss, Liv Garfield, was forced last week to defend her £3.2m pay packet for 2023 and the nearly £13m she had received over the past four years. She told the BBC that the 60,000 sewage spills “doesn’t make me feel good”. Severn Trent raised £1bn last year, in a sign that investors are still prepared to pump money into the sector despite the financial troubles at Thames Water, Britain’s biggest water company. On Wednesday, Garfield said: “The extra £1bn we raised from our investors will help us continue to transform the network, reducing spills, improving river health and providing our customers with the best and most reliable service. We are planning record levels of investment in the coming years, while also keeping bills the second lowest in the country. “Our customers and the communities in which they live are at the heart of our business and we’re doing more than ever to ensure we have a positive economic, environmental and social impact across our region.” Water companies are awaiting a draft view from the industry regulator, Ofwat, on their business plans for the five years to 2030, which will be delivered on 12 June. Severn Trent has proposed to invest £12.9bn and increase customer bills to £518 a year over the period. The company is in the process of spending £450m to improve 900 storm overflow points, about a third of the total across its network, as part of a push to halve its average spill rate by 2030. Neil Shah, the director of research at the investment firm Edison Group, said Severn Trent had made progress in “reductions in supply interruptions, blockages and low-pressure incidents”. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of MPs has said that water bills should be frozen until performance on sewage discharges into waterways had improved. Thirty-seven MPs from Labour and the Green party have written to David Black, the CEO of Ofwat, urging him to deny the water companies’ requests in the price review process. The MPs argue in their letter that, on top of illness, worry and inconvenience caused to their constituents by repeated sewage spills, “the excessive price rises proposed will cause them further harm and cannot be justified”. They are asking him to block any proposals for above-inflation price rises until 2030, and to ban the payment of dividends until agreed infrastructure improvements have been funded by shareholders. The letter was signed by MPs including Labour’s Clive Lewis, Barry Gardiner, who sits on the environment audit committee, the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the former shadow environment minister Alex Sobel, and the Green party’s Caroline Lucas. On Wednesday, the environment, food and rural affairs committee announced it would be hauling in United Utilities and South West Water for questioning after sewage spills into Windermere in the Lake District and a period of unsafe drinking water in Brixham, Devon, to ask for assurances such incidents will not happen again. Water UK, which represents the water companies, has been contacted for comment.",

        "content": "Motorists have been warned to be vigilant after a 60-fold increase in “crash for cash” fraud claims involving motorbike and scooter riders staging accidents so they can blame innocent drivers. The insurer Allianz said its data showed that claims relating to this scam increased by 6,000% between January and December 2023 – a significant jump from the 50% increase the year before. This type of insurance fraud typically involves an “induced accident”, in which a rider attempts to deliberately get hit by a vehicle in order to make a claim. Criminals often target drivers as they park their cars – for example, they will ride past just as the driver opens the car door so that it hits the motorbike or scooter, with the aim being to make it appear the motorist’s fault. Allianz said its data showed that four in 10 of these “accidents” happened during the afternoon and evening school run and rush hour – between 3pm and 7pm. Lunchtime also seemed to be a “prime time” for fraudsters, with 27% of collisions happening between 11am and 2pm. More than half of the incidents took place in Greater London. Croydon and Enfield were named as “hotspot” locations for this type of fraud. The consumer organisation Which? has previously said that new variations of this type of fraud have also been emerging, including “wing mirror scams”, where a fraudster throws an object at a passing car to make an impact sound, then pursues the driver claiming they have clipped their wing mirror (which was already damaged) and then either demanding cash or initiating a claim. Matt Crabtree, head of financial crime intelligence and investigation strategy at Allianz’s personal lines business, said: “It’s shocking that we’ve seen a 60-fold increase in the number of motorbike ‘crash for cash’ claims in 2023.” Innocent victims were being physically and emotionally affected by this crime, and it was also putting children, passersby and others at significant risk, he added. Allianz, which includes the general insurance arm of LV=, said that as well as targeting large cities, organised criminal gangs were focusing their attention on small towns and the outskirts of cities, including places such as Thornton Heath, in the London borough of Croydon, and Hagley, a few miles outside Birmingham. The Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB), the organisation that heads up the industry’s fight against insurance fraud, said it was urging the public “to be vigilant to signs of this dangerous activity”. The advice from insurers includes being alert to any unusual driving behaviour and taking particular care at junctions and when pulling out from a parked position or side road. Earlier this month Allianz said there had been a surge in fraud cases recently in which photos were manipulated using apps and software in order to show fake car crash damage.",

        "title": "Jeremy Hunt’s tax cut plans face setback as government borrowing tops £20bn",
        "content": "Jeremy Hunt’s plans for pre-election tax cuts have received a setback after higher spending on benefits and lower tax receipts pushed government borrowing above £20bn last month. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the budget deficit – the gap between public spending and tax receipts – was £1.5bn higher than a year earlier and the fourth highest for an April since records began. Hunt is relying on an improvement in the public finances to justify tax cuts before voters go to the polls, but the latest figures show them to be in a worse state than forecast at the time of the March budget. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said April’s deficit was £1.2bn higher than it had predicted, with the overshoot caused by higher Whitehall spending, benefit increases and weaker tax revenues. Last month marked the introduction of Hunt’s second cut in national insurance contributions (NICs). The OBR said it had also revised up its estimate of the 2023-4 deficit by £0.8bn. The ONS chief economist, Grant Fitzner, said: “While central government spending and income overall both rose on this time last year, a large drop in NICs meant receipts did not grow as fast as spending. “Here, falls in expenditure on energy support were offset by increases in benefit spending from the annual uprating.” Debt as a share of national income stood at 97.9% in April and stood at its highest level since the early 1960s after rising by 2.5 percentage points over the past year. Analysts said the April public finances data further eroded Hunt’s already limited scope for tax cuts without breaking his self-imposed rule that debt should be falling as a share of national income within five years. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macro, said: “The headroom to cut taxes doesn’t exist, but chancellor Hunt seems likely to go ahead anyway in a pre-election autumn statement, probably in September. “Spending demands overshooting forecasts is likely to be an ongoing theme for the public finances, with Hunt planning implausibly weak expenditure to generate his tax-cutting room.” Peter Arnold, chief economist at EY UK, said he saw April’s under performance continuing through the rest of the 2024-5 financial year. Yields on government bonds and official interest rates were likely to be higher than the assumptions used in the OBR’s March forecast, implying higher-than-expected debt servicing costs. “Some of this impact looks likely to endure to the end of the OBR’s five-year forecast horizon, cutting the already-slim headroom against the government’s main fiscal rule,” Arnold said. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund warned Hunt against pre-election tax cuts and pointed to a looming £30bn hole in the public finances. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We rightly protected millions of jobs during Covid and paid half of people’s energy bills after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine sent bills skyrocketing – but it wouldn’t be fair to leave future generations to pick up the tab. “That’s why we must stick to the plan to get debt falling.”",

        "content": "The boss of Marks &amp; Spencer says he is hopeful of a “growth story for years to come” after the revitalised retailer won over 1 million more shoppers to boost profits by 41%. Stuart Machin, the chief executive, said it was “the beginnings of a new M&amp;S” and there was “wind in our sails and confidence that our plan is working” as pre-tax profits rose to £672.5m in the year to 30 March. Sales rose 9.4% to £13bn on the back of an 11.3% rise in grocery sales at established stores. The increase was not just a result of inflation, with the volume of goods sold up 5% after the group invested £60m in keeping prices down. Machin said the retailer, which has 240 full-line stores and 325 food outlets, was winning over a “broad church” of new customers. More under-30s are buying its lingerie than ever before, taking its market share in that product category to a new high of 38%. Shares in the group rose nearly 6% on Wednesday morning as it announced its first dividend payment to shareholders since 2019, and Machin said M&amp;S was in “the best financial health it’s been in decades” with debts reduced. He said the company was now aiming for £100m in extra cost cuts by 2028 as it improves efficiency by, for example, working with fewer clothing suppliers and sharpening up the way goods are delivered so that less work is required behind the scenes. The leap in profits came after £180m of cost cuts, including keeping the number of staff steady in food stores despite higher sales and lowering the cost of delivering food to stores after buying its distribution partner Gist. It has also ditched selling furniture that requires two-person delivery. M&amp;S said it was bolstering its five-year plan for cost cuts to £500m by 2028 with increases in staff pay offset by “structural cost reductions and other efficiencies” – which the company says relates to more efficient deliveries to free up staff to work with customers, rather than job cuts. Other cost inflation is largely expected be offset by reduced energy costs. Machin said M&amp;S had increased its market share in clothing and homewares and was “confident we will make further progress”, in a bullish prediction for the year ahead. The upmarket grocer said it had benefited from a shift towards eating at home rather than at restaurants, with sales of its “dine in” offer up by more than 40%, while shoppers also spent 34% more on its lowest price Remarksable Value range. Clothing and home sales increased 5.3%, helped by a 15% rise in sales of holiday wear such as swimsuits, while sales of its more expensive Autograph range for men rose 15%. Machin said M&amp;S had tried to keep clothing prices steady and would do so again in the year ahead after sales of basics including denim and knitwear rose by more than 10%. He said the group did not plan to introduce special discounts for its Sparks loyalty card holders, as done by major chains including Tesco and Sainsbury’s, as the group “didn’t want to get into tricksy prices”. He said short-term price cuts were “forcing you to buy something you don’t really want”. M&amp;S’s share of losses at Ocado Retail, its online grocery shopping joint venture, widened to £37.3m, from £29.5m, and M&amp;S reiterated that it did not expect to have to pay a final instalment for its share in the business, which was once expected to be £191m. Sales at M&amp;S’s international stores slid by 1% at constant currency rates to £719m and Machin said it was now “resetting priorities” to step up progress. Clive Black, a retail analyst at M&amp;S’s broker Shore Capital, said the retailer had “materially beaten market expectations” and he had upgraded his expectations for the year ahead by about 12%. The group plans to open nine new food stores in the year ahead, up from eight last year, and up to four full-line clothing and home stores, down from six last year, when it also closed seven and relocated five stores.",

        "title": "Citigroup fined over ‘fat finger’ error that led to £1.1bn of mistaken orders",
        "content": "Citigroup has been fined £61.6m by financial regulators after its internal systems failed to prevent a fat-fingered banker causing a flash crash by erroneously placing more than £1bn of orders. The trader had intended to sell equities to the value of $58m (£46m) on 2 May 2022. However, the banker made an inputting error while entering the transaction into Citigroup’s order management system, so a giant equities basket of $444bn was created – and $1.4bn was then sold into the market. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would fine Citigroup Global Markets £27.77m over the incident on 2 May 2022, which caused a flash crash in European stocks. The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) also imposed a financial penalty of £33.88m after its own investigation. The mistake happened after the Citigroup trader, whose name has not been disclosed, entered the value of the basket of equities in the wrong field into the order system. The banker had planned to enter 58m into the “notional” field of the Citigroup order system, which would have created a basket of equities worth that value in dollars. Instead, they entered 58m into the “quantity” field of the order system – creating a giant basket of 349 stocks with a total notional size of $444bn, according to the PRA statement. Citigroup’s internal system blocked $255bn of the equities basket progressing but the remaining $189bn was sent to a trading algorithm that sold shares into the market for the rest of the day, selling a total of $1.4bn of equities across European stock exchanges. The FCA said the trader was able to manually override a pop-up alert, without being required to scroll down and read all the alerts within it, and the US bank’s real-time monitoring was “ineffective”, which meant that it was “too slow” to escalate internal alerts about the erroneous trades. This sales order coincided with a significant short-term drop for a few minutes in several European markets, before the banker discovered the error and cancelled the trade 15 minutes later. The error, which resulted in a $48m loss for Citigroup, is highly embarrassing for the bank. Citigroup agreed to settle with the FCA, meaning it received a 30% discount to the fine that would otherwise have been £39.66m. The PRA’s penalty of £33.88m would have been £48.4m if the bank had disputed the findings. The bank said in a statement: “We are pleased to resolve this matter from more than two years ago, which arose from an individual error that was identified and corrected within minutes. We immediately took steps to strengthen our systems and controls, and remain committed to ensuring full regulatory compliance.”",

        "title": "Big drop in UK inflation rate disguises more disappointing details",
        "content": "The annual inflation rate fell sharply in April. Prices are rising more slowly than at any time in almost three years. Inflation is lower in the UK than it is in the EU. Even so, the latest bulletin on the cost of living from the Office for National Statistics was mildly disappointing. April’s inflation figure was always going to be good, with a sharp fall guaranteed by the fact the energy price increases of a year earlier were not repeated. But at 2.3%, the number was slightly higher than expected. The consensus among economists polled by Reuters was 2.1%. Some had even predicted it would drop below the government’s 2% target. The main reason for the fall from 3.2% in March was the continuing downward trend in household energy bills. According to the ONS, prices of electricity, gas and other fuels were 27.1% lower this April than in April 2023, the sharpest decline since records began in 1989. Food price inflation was also down – from 4% to 2.8%. These developments are helpful for poorer households, which spend a bigger share of their income on heating, lighting and putting food on the table. But there was also some less good news. Core inflation – which strips out food, energy, tobacco and alcoholic drinks – fell from 4.2% to 3.9%, rather than the 3.6% expected. Even more worryingly, inflation in the services sector – which is closely monitored by Bank of England interest rate setters – barely budged, falling from 6% to 5.9%. One reason for that appears to be that businesses passed on at least some of the higher costs from the higher national living wage, which went up from £10.42 to £11.44 last month, to their customers. Inflation in the hotels and restaurants sector – parts of the economy with a heavy concentration of minimum-wage workers – rose last month from 5.8% to 6%. The Bank’s monetary policy committee will be paying a lot more attention to services inflation than they will to the headline 2.3% figure because it thinks it is a reasonable guide to price pressures generated by the domestic UK economy. Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there were plenty of examples of sticky service inflation: accommodation, water bills, air fares, catering, and recreation and cultural services all experienced hefty price increases last month. “Upside surprises elsewhere were widespread, not focused in a few erratic components,” he said. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, had been predicting a much bigger fall to 5.2% in services inflation in April, and says the much smaller decrease will affect the timing of cuts in official borrowing costs. “Even though there is still a wages and an inflation release to go before the Bank of England meeting on 20 June, it feels as though a cut then now seems very unlikely. Even a cut in August is looking a bit more doubtful,” he said.",

        "content": "UK inflation fell to 2.3% in April – its lowest level for almost three years – but the decline was smaller than expected, denting hopes of an early interest rate cut. City analysts had forecast the annual increase in the cost of goods and services would fall to 2.1%, close to the Bank of England’s 2% target. Markets responded by trimming their predictions that the Bank would cut rates from their current 5.25% level as early as next month, with forecasts of a reduction in August also scaled back. Last month’s 2.3% fall in the consumer prices index (CPI), down from 3.2% in March, was driven by easing energy and food costs. The last time inflation was lower was in July 2021. Electricity and gas prices fell over the last year by 27%, the biggest drop on record, and food and soft drink prices increased by 2.9% annually, the lowest rise since November 2021. Illustrating the pressure on household budgets and the reluctance to buy big-ticket items, furniture retailers cut prices by 0.9% between March and April, and the cost of all goods dropped by 0.8% month on month. Annual services inflation, which mainly reflects the costs companies charge each other, was 5.9%, barely down from March’s 6%. A sharp rise in property rents over the last year kept a measure of inflation that includes housing costs much higher than the headline CPI. Higher mortgage costs were another factor that meant the ONS’s alternative consumer prices index including housing (CPIH) rose by 3% year on year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said inflation was prevented from slowing more last month by a rise in petrol and diesel prices, although the price of a barrel of Brent crude has steadied recently at about $83 (£65). Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said the likelihood of an interest rate cut as soon as next month had receded. “Falling inflation closes in on the Bank of England’s target but may not be enough to sway an early rate cut,” she said. Paula Bejarano Carbo, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said core inflation – which strips out food and energy costs – remained higher than its historical average at 3.9% and this would need to fall before the central bank’s monetary policy committee was comfortable cutting rates. “Paired with last week’s strong wage growth data, we believe that elevated services inflation will remain an upwards risk to inflationary pressures in the second half of this year. As a result, the MPC may exert caution at its upcoming meeting and hold interest rates, despite today’s encouraging fall in the headline rate.” Rishi Sunak said April’s CPI figure marked “a major moment for the economy, with inflation back to normal”. The prime minister said: “This is proof that the plan is working and that the difficult decisions we have taken are paying off.” The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said although inflation had fallen, now was “not the time for Conservative ministers to be popping champagne corks”. She posted on X: “Prices have soared, mortgages bills have risen and taxes are at a 70-year high. Only Labour can be trusted to protect and improve family finances.” Inflation was 2.4% in the 20-member eurozone in April, the same as the previous month. Separate ONS figures also released on Wednesday showed the public finances suffered a larger-than-expected rise in April. The high cost of financing the UK’s government debt played a large part in pushing the monthly deficit to £20.5bn, the fourth highest April borrowing since monthly records began in 1993 and £1.9bn more than official forecasts. Debt payments decreased by £1.7bn to £8.6bn but remained at a higher level than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had pencilled in. Some analysts said the figures showed the government’s finances were being squeezed and ruled out tax cuts by the chancellor before the general election. Martin Beck, an economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: “The new fiscal year got off to a disappointing start for the UK’s public finances, with borrowing coming in above the OBR forecast. The effect on debt servicing costs of higher bank rate and gilt yields than the OBR assumed in its budget forecast mean that this under-performance is likely to continue for the rest of the financial year. “It’s unlikely that OBR forecast revisions would offer the government scope for another tax-cutting fiscal event before the next general election.”",

        "title": "Do heat pumps work at freezing temperatures?",
        "content": "The belief that a heat pump is unable to warm a home in the depths of winter is widely held, especially in the UK. One recent survey of more than 4,000 adults across the UK, Germany, France and the US last autumn found that 35% believed that air-source heat pumps are not up to the job. The study, undertaken by the data company Electrify Research, found that more than 40% of Britons agreed that heat pumps are not up to the challenge compared with 36% in Germany, 35% in the US and 26% in France. The research report described the UK’s markedly higher scepticism as “ironic” given that its winter temperatures are far milder than in Norway, where the average winter temperature is -7C and heat pumps are installed in two-thirds of homes. The claim Critics of heat pumps are often quite succinct: they just do not work, but especially not when you need them most. To understand whether they can perform in freezing temperatures, first consider how they work: just like a fridge absorbs heat from its interior and dissipates it through coils on its back, a heat pump absorbs heat from the outside air to raise the temperature of water which can then be pumped through the radiators of a home’s heating system. Critics claim heat pumps do not work as well during freezing periods because there is less heat energy in the air to absorb. Willie Haughey, a Labour peer and refrigeration tycoon, whose business carries out heat pump installations, has repeatedly warned that they are not suitable for the Scottish climate. He told the Times last year: “The truth of the matter is that heat pumps don’t work as efficiently in Scotland as they do in other countries. The water can only be heated to 54C, which is lower than the Health and Safety Executive’s recommended figure of 60C.” He repeated his claim that heat pumps should not be considered an alternative heating source to gas in an interview with BBC Radio 4. There are plenty of sceptics working in the heating industry, too. One boiler installer said: “They just don’t work. The water temperature is usually set to 40C so it just can’t heat your house when it’s really cold outside. My son is doing the accreditation to install heat pumps, but it’s not for me. I won’t touch them.” His views are typical of some in the industry, but are they backed by evidence? The science It may not be obvious, but even on freezing days there is still some heat energy in the air which can be harnessed.. It helps to take a closer look at the science behind a heat pump. First, they absorb heat energy from the air via an evaporator which contains a cold liquid refrigerant. The refrigerant boils to become a gas at extremely low temperatures, often about -20C, meaning that even if the outside air temperature is as low as -10C it is still 10C warmer than the refrigerant. The heat pump’s compressor then pushes the gas molecules together to raise the temperature of the gas. Pipes containing the hot gas are used to heat cold water, which then runs through a home heating system into radiators and underfloor heating pipes. Heat pumps need to work harder in cold temperatures but they still perform well whatever the weather, according to the Energy Systems Catapult (ESC), an independent research and technology organisation set up by the UK government. In a study spanning almost two years, the government-funded demonstration project analysed the performance of 750 heat pumps on some of the country’s coldest days, where mean daily temperatures fell to as low as -6C. It found only a marginal decline in the efficiency of a heat pump heating system. In the first mythbuster feature of this series we learned that the measure used to rate the efficiency of a heat pump over a year is known as the seasonal coefficient of performance (SCoP), which is typically 2.9 for an air-source heat pump. The ESC study found that the median coefficient of performance (CoP) fell to 2.44 on the coldest days of the year. This means that a heat pump would need to work harder to achieve the same indoor temperature when it is cold – but the difference would be marginal, and is already included in the SCoP averaged over the year including wintry months. The findings are backed up by a separate study undertaken by the Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP) which analysed 550 homes across Europe. It found that even at temperatures of -20C a heat pump’s efficiency would fall to an average CoP of 2. The caveats For most climates heat pumps will work in cold weather, but correct installation is vital. Ran Boydell, an associate professor at Heriot-Watt University, said: “If a heat pump doesn’t perform effectively in cold weather, chances are the unit was incorrectly specified for the location.” Assuming you have a properly installed heat pump which is able to heat your home through freezing temperatures, one caveat to note is that your running costs for this period are likely to be higher as the efficiency of the heat pump falls. Heat pumps can be cheaper to run than gas boilers in the UK, especially if you choose an electricity tariff designed for heat pump users. During periods when the temperature dips to -6C it is likely that the running costs would rise to just above those of a gas boiler – but only for these periods. Over the course of a normal year – including typical cold spells – heat pump costs are still attractive when compared with gas boilers. Sometimes heat pumps do need backup. In many Nordic countries it is common for heat pumps to have some kind of fossil fuel reinforcement for when temperatures plunge to -20C or below. But there are ways to reduce reliance on gas or oil heating even at these temperatures. Ground-source heat pumps, for example, can be more efficient than air-source heat pumps because the ground is often able to retain heat better during a cold spell. A new generation of air-source heat pump, designed for cold climates, can also help to reduce the need for backup heating. The verdict “We can finally put to bed the notion that heat pumps do not work in cold weather conditions and that they are inefficient to run. We’ve observed the exact opposite,” said Marc Brown, a business leader at ESC. The science shows that heat pumps can work at winter temperatures. But poor advice and installation can upend even the most encouraging scientific findings. Richard Halsey, a director at the ESC, said: “One of the key findings from our study is that proper design and installation is at the heart of delivering a heat pump that works for the home that it’s in. “For most homes – regardless of property type or age – a well-installed heat pump producing a flow temperature of about 40C should still result in a comfortable home most of the time. But there’s no one-size-fits-all setup for a heat pump.”",

        "title": "Three years of pain: how inflation drove the UK cost of living crisis",
        "content": "After three long years of feeling the pinch, UK consumers finally look likely to get some relief from surging prices on Wednesday, when the Office for National Statistics releases its inflation figures for April. The data is widely expected to show that prices are rising at the lowest rate since summer 2021. Inflation of about 2% is significant for economists, marking a long-awaited snap back towards the Bank of England’s target. It still means prices are rising for the consumer, but not as steeply as they have been. The last few years of inflation have been the sharpest within at least 40 years, jumping the equivalent of 11 years of normal 2% inflation within just three years, a total rise of 22%. At the same time, real wages are down by 2.3% since early 2021, making it harder for most people to afford their energy bills and the weekly shop. But not everyone has felt the price rises equally – and not all goods and services have been equally affected. Here, we take a look at notable items that have risen in price since UK inflation was last at 2%, in July 2021, and how the UK compares internationally. What’s gone up the most? The consumer price index (CPI) calculates the changes in the cost of a basket of goods and services, from shampoo to secondhand cars to socks. But since July 2021, the items in the basket that have risen the most in price have all been food. A packet of four frozen beef burgers is now £3.56, up 51.5% from £2.35 three years ago and 1kg of plums has gone up by 53.9% from £2.36 to £3.63 in that time. Meanwhile, the cost of a cucumber has risen by 72.2%, from 54p to 93p, and granulated sugar from 69p, up 72.5%, to £1.20. The steepest increase by far has come from olive oil, a litre of which costs 120% more in 2024 than it did in July 2021, leaping from £3.65 to £8.04. Partly, this is because of changes in the climate. Olive growers in the Mediterranean faced the hottest summer on record in 2023, affecting crop yields. Across all categories, food has been a big driver of inflation in the UK. Food costs have risen a third more than overall prices. Again, lower-income households have been hit hardest, as a bigger proportion of their income is spent on food. Trussell Trust, a food bank, delivered more than 3m emergency parcels in 2022-23, up by 50% on 2019-20. As a result, some people are simply eating less. Real consumption of food has fallen by 7% since the first three months of 2021, according to the Resolution Foundation. Overall, food prices have risen by 31% since March 2021, the Resolution Foundation said, compared with a 90% increase in the price of electricity, gas and other fuels. What else has risen in price and by how much? CPI inflation takes into account price fluctuations of different services, from manicures to cremation services, driving lessons and nursery school fees. In the UK, it is the cost of going out that has hit wallets. A night in a hotel is now £114.63, up 31.8% from £87.97, marking an end to the idea of budget nights away, while an adult theatre ticket has gone up by 32.5% from £28.85 to £38.24. A cigarette is now much more expensive, with 30g of hand-rolling tobacco costing £18.27, up 39.1% from £11.88, thanks to the increase in tobacco duty introduced in 2023. Home improvements have also become more expensive: gardeners will have noticed the price of potting compost increasing by 28.2%from £4.71 to £6.04, while ceramic tiles are now £18.27, up by 53.8% from £11.88. Despite the rising cost of recreational activities, from hotels to theatres, households have increased spending on holidays and dining out since the cost of living crisis started to ease. Since the first three months of 2023, household spending on hospitality and air fares is up by 1.1%, according to the Resolution Foundation. To offset that spending, households appear to be putting off buying bigger ticket or luxury household items such as appliances. Real-terms spending on household appliances fell 18% between the first three months of 2022 and the final three months of 2023, researchers found. Easing pressure on gas and electricity bills Of all the pressures on spending, energy has risen the most. At its peak in the winter of 2022, the wholesale price of energy was 10 times greater than it was in 2021. The amount consumers pay for electricity and gas in the UK is set by the energy price cap, which was introduced by the regulator in 2019 to prevent millions of households from being hit by extraordinary increases in bills on variable tariffs. In the summer of 2021, the energy price cap was set at £1,084 a year for people who pay by direct debit and £1,128 for those on prepayment metres. In spring 2024, it had increased to £1,690 a year for direct debit payers and £1,643 a year for prepayments, an increase of 56% and 45.7%, respectively. British households fared particularly badly compared with those in other European countries because of the UK’s high dependence on gas, according to the International Montetary Fund. Gas is used to generate 40% of UK electricity and to heat 85% of UK homes. Poorest households suffered most from the spike in energy prices. Those households with some of the lowest incomes spend about 50% more proportionately on energy and food than those with some of the highest incomes, according to the Resolution Foundation. Poorer households spend a bigger proportion of their income on utility bills and are more likely to be in fuel poverty, defined as a household spending more than 10% of its income on energy, after housing costs. More than a third of households (36.4%) exceeded this threshold in 2023, up from 27.4% in 2022. Even though headline inflation has fallen back, household energy bills are expected to stay about 40% higher than they were before Russia invaded Ukraine, and until at least the end of 2024. How does the UK compare? UK inflation has been the highest of any country in the G7, and larger than all but Iceland and Sweden in a list of the 23 rich countries for which the OECD produces comparable data. That is partly to do with the UK’s reliance on food imports. Half of UK food is imported. The price of food can fluctuate with higher transportation costs and any extra fees or delays at the border after Brexit. UK supermarkets also a prices on longer term contracts, meaning some have been stuck with higher prices while European supermarkets have passed on cheaper deals to the consumer. The UK is also more vulnerable than other countries to energy price spikes thanks to its reliance on gas. Analysts say the energy price cap can create an “artificial bubble” and that European consumers feel the benefit of falling energy prices sooner. In Germany, inflation was 2.4% in April, up from 2.3% in March, while in France, inflation was 2.4% in April, unchanged from March. A drop in UK CPI inflation to nearer 2% in April would make it one of the lower rates in the Europe. But few analysts expect the drop in inflation to translate directly into household budgets. GDP will be about 2% lower by the end of next year than was expected before the cost of living crisis, the equivalent of £1,900 a household, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. Inflation may be back towards the Bank of England’s target, but until recent price rises are matched with higher incomes, most UK households will face lower living standards for some time to come.",

        "title": "Current and future chancellor face tough choices after IMF report on UK economy",
        "content": "A report that tells the UK government it faces a £30bn funding gap that cannot be filled by higher growth or extra borrowing is a blow to both the current chancellor and the next one. Tuesday’s International Monetary Fund assessment of the UK economy and Whitehall spending argues that betting on the economy revving up over the rest of the decade will not be sufficient to pay for all the likely welfare bills associated with an ageing population. Extra borrowing is also off the table, says the IMF, after it forecast a rise in the UK’s total public debt to 97% of annual national income. If Jeremy Hunt listens to the policy wonks from Washington he must abandon any plans for eye-catching tax cuts ahead of the looming general election. The IMF says Hunt can only justify a repeat of the March budget’s 2p national insurance cut if he can argue there will be a payback in extra growth and there are offsetting tax rises made elsewhere. The Office for Budget Responsibility will prevent him from saying the first and Tory backbenchers will stop the second, leaving the chancellor with little to offer voters without distancing himself from the IMF. There is an argument for ignoring the IMF, which was a cheerleader for austerity in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. Back then, it supported most measures that brought down debt levels, though it was subsequently agreed by many economists that austerity denied governments the level of investment cash needed to spur future growth. The IMF would argue that its latest Article IV review of the UK economy calls for a more nuanced response. Yes, it rejects extra borrowing in favour of higher tax receipts to pay for government spending, but the emphasis is on rebalancing and expanding the tax base rather than loading higher income tax or national insurance rates on households with modest incomes. “Additional revenue should come from higher carbon and road-usage taxation, broadening the VAT and inheritance tax bases, and reforming capital gains,” the IMF said, raising more funds from, among others, older, richer people that drive big cars. Likewise on the spending side, the IMF calls the triple lock on state pension payments into question. It balks at a full-scale review that might call for the means testing of the state pension, bringing it into line with means-tested working age benefits, but says increases should be limited to a link with inflation. These are tough choices for any chancellor to make. Rachel Reeves, who expects to take up residence in No 11 following a Labour victory, has repeatedly made the case for increased government spending without the need for higher borrowing or tax rises. She says the tax receipts that flow from higher productivity and faster economic growth will fill the void. The IMF boss, Krystalina Georgieva, argues there is no way to grow the economy in a way that can ease the pressure on the public finances. Growth is not enough. Only one of them will be right.",

        "title": "Online car dealer Cazoo collapses into administration putting 200 jobs at risk",
        "content": "The online car dealer Cazoo, which was once valued at $8bn (£6.3bn), has collapsed into administration, putting 200 jobs at risk. Administrators at Teneo have been appointed to the business, which was founded by Alex Chesterman, the serial entrepreneur who also launched property site Zoopla and Netflix forerunner LoveFilm. Teneo is now on the hunt for a buyer for Cazoo’s remaining assets, including its online marketplace. “Following our appointment, we continue to progress discussions with a number of interested parties on the marketplace business and remaining customer collections centres,” one of Teneo’s administrators, Matt Mawhinney, said in a statement. “The marketplace model is performing ahead of expectations, with strong dealer sign-up, and the administration appointment provides us with an opportunity to secure a sale of the business over the course of coming weeks.” The company’s collapse comes just two years after the UK-based used-car website listed on the New York Stock Exchange to much fanfare in 2021. It spent a hefty sum sponsoring football clubs including Aston Villa and Everton, as well as horse racing, darts, snooker and cricket to bolster its brand. While it has sold 160,000 vehicles since its launch in 2018, an inflation-induced squeeze on consumer spending put further pressure on the firm’s finances, forcing it to abandon its EU business and resulting in more than 700 job cuts and losses of £700m in 2022. In early 2023, Chesterman stepped down as chief executive to become the company’s chair, before resigning from the firm in December. By March this year, Cazoo announced further restructuring, including the sale of a car repair centre in Bedfordshire and customer collection centres in Birmingham and Bristol, to focus solely on its online buy-and-sell platform. The move resulted in a further 720 job losses. While bosses managed to repay loans and slim down the business, they said the company was still short of the capital needed to sustain the business in the long term. The board said in a US filing that it was “in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders to commence the winding up of the company”. Cazoo’s remaining 200 employees are now at risk, including 124 who work for the marketplace division in London, and 25 at the group’s customer collection centres in Manchester and Northampton. Their jobs will depend on whether administrators can find a buyer, and whether the new owners were willing to employ them. A further 59 employees – most of which are from the head office and customer service centres in London and Southampton – will be helping Teneo wind down the business, until they are no longer needed. Cazoo is now planning to hold an extraordinary meeting with shareholders on 6 June to approve the winding-up. Chesterman declined to comment.",

        "title": "Will AstraZeneca be the UK’s first £200bn company?",
        "content": "The last time the AstraZeneca chief executive, Pascal Soriot, set long-term sales targets, he was greeted with a chorus of scepticism. It was 2014 and the company was fighting a takeover attempt by Pfizer of the US; Soriot seemed to be engaging in that age-old defence trick of throwing out a large number that he probably would not be around to deliver. A target to boost revenues by three-quarters over nine years looked wildly optimistic – a decade ago, the Anglo-Swedish firm was more laggard than leader in pharma-land. In the event, of course, the milestone of $45bn was achieved ahead of time, which is why Tuesday’s latest long-term prediction of annual revenues of $80bn (£63bn) by 2030 will be treated as ultra-credible. Soriot is also still in post – and fit enough to do another five years, he said last year – so success or failure should be reasonably clear by the time he finally departs. As it is, growth was 19% in the last quarter, so a fast start is guaranteed. One can can see also see how the pieces should fit together to hit $80bn, albeit the odd acquisition may be needed on the way. Growth in pharma is about ensuring you have more, and bigger-selling, new products to replace those that are losing their patents. AstraZeneca says it intends to launch 20 products by 2030, with 12 having the potential to generate peak annual sales of $5bn-plus. With patent expiries for the period being modest versus historical averages, the bald arithmetic would seem to add up, even when taking account of inevitable individual failures in clinical trials and modest pressure on drug pricing in the US under the Inflation Reduction Act. Nor should the vague-sounding line about “investing in transformative new technologies and platforms that will shape the future of medicine” be regarded as overly hopeful. The post-2014 transformation of AstraZeneca was about success in new fields, notably oncology (now 40% of revenues) and rare diseases (via the acquisition of Alexion in 2021). This time around, the potentially interesting new piece in the portfolio is antibody-drug conjugates, a more refined technique to target cancer cells. That sounds more significant than a move into the crowded territory of anti-obesity treatments. Not for the first time, one can reflect that seeing off Pfizer in 2014 was a history-turning moment, not just for AstraZeneca but also for the UK pharma industry. It is impossible to believe Soriot’s science-led investment-heavy approach would have survived under the would-be US acquirer, which at the time seemed mostly interested in the scope for cost cuts and tax efficiencies. The takeover offer was worth £69bn, which felt enormous in 2014, but AstraZeneca these days is worth £190bn and is the UK’s most valuable listed company. There is a race with Shell (valued at £179bn) to be the first FTSE 100 stock to achieve the round number of £200bn. One of them will get there soon enough, but you have got very long odds in 2014 on it being AstraZeneca.",

        "title": "What causes air turbulence and is the climate crisis making it worse?",
        "content": "The death of a British passenger and injuries to others on a Singapore Airlines passenger flight from London has underlined the potential dangers of turbulence. But what causes turbulence, how much risk does it pose – and is the climate crisis making it worse? How rare are casualties? On international scheduled flights, fatalities directly caused by turbulence are incredibly rare. Pilots are usually able to give advance warning of most types of turbulence and ensure all on board are strapped in. On smaller private planes or business jets, serious injuries or deaths have been more frequent, with the US National Transport Safety Board recording more than 100 injuries and dozens of deaths in just over a decade on domestic flights, although fatalities have mostly occurred when turbulence has caused the planes to crash. On bigger planes, turbulence risks head or other injuries to people who could be thrown around the cabin if not strapped in, or be struck by flying debris – not least during a trolley service. Crew are at particular risk and have the biggest number of injuries. What is turbulence and how can planes avoid it? Broadly, it is caused by the meeting of air at different temperatures, pressure or velocity, where different wind patterns collide – a bit like boats suddenly encountering choppy waters. While some weather and geographical conditions, such as thunderstorms, mountain ranges and the appearance of certain clouds, can signal turbulence ahead, there is also “clear-air turbulence”, which can take plane pilots by surprise and occur without warning. Stuart Fox, director of flight and technical operations at the global airline body Iata, says forecasts showing incoming weather fronts or the air flow over mountains could demonstrate a higher probability of clear-air turbulence. “But you can’t see it,” he says. “Airflow strength and direction can change rapidly, and the forecasts can only indicate the likelihood.” Such wind shears can knock planes off course, lose altitude quickly or lurch violently. Pilots can now be steered by reports from aircraft ahead. Iata hosts a platform used by a number of rival carriers to exchange data, Fox says: “It gives immediate information for people who could be flying into the same turbulence.” But while areas such as the Bay of Bengal are well known for turbulence, pilots’ options may be limited, says Marco Chan, a former commercial pilot and lecturer in aviation at Buckinghamshire New University. He says the Singapore Airlines incident took place “within the inter-tropical convergence zone, where thunderstorms are notorious. Thunderstorms are prominently displayed on the pilots’ navigation display – but it may not be possible to completely circumvent the storm cluster as they can stretch well over 50 nautical miles.” Is the climate crisis making it worse? Yes, according to at least one study. Scientists at Reading University said their research showed higher temperatures as a result of the climate crisis were leading to significant increases in turbulence across transatlantic flights. Incidents of severe turbulence increased by 55% between 1979 and 2020, they found, owing to changes in wind velocity at high altitudes. Prof Paul Williams, one of the authors of the study, said it showed predicted choppier skies had already arrived. He added that the aviation industry needed to invest in better systems to forecast and detect turbulence. How worried should passengers be? Episodes of turbulence are certainly alarming – but the risks of severe injury to passengers or worse have been remote on major commercial airliners, until the tragic event on Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 on Tuesday. The last confirmed casualty caused by turbulence that Iata was aware of on a scheduled flight was in 1997, on board a United Airlines flight from Tokyo to Honolulu. However, Fox said: “Most airlines advise passengers to wear their seatbelts throughout the flight, and I think that’s good advice.”",

        "title": "UK economy heading for ‘soft landing’ says IMF, in warning against tax cuts – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up…. Here are today’s main stories: As feared this morning, online car retailer Cazoo has collapsed into administration. The online car retailer has appointed Teneo as administrators, who will now try to sell its remaining assets. Matt Mawhinney, joint administrator at Teneo, says: “Following our appointment, we continue to progress discussions with a number of interested parties on the marketplace business and remaining customer collections centres. “The marketplace model is performing ahead of expectations, with strong dealer sign up, and the administration appointment provides us with an opportunity to secure a sale of the business over the course of coming weeks.” Cazoo currently employs 208 staff, having laid off more than 700 in recent weeks. Over in Canada, inflation has cooled to a three-year low in a sign that global inflationary pressures are easing. Canada’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% on a year-over-year basis in April, down from 2.9% in March. That’s the lowest rate since March 2021. Food prices, services and durable goods prices all pulled inflation down, while gasoline prices rose at a faster rate. More than 18% of Shell’s shareholders have voted in favour of a resolution calling the company to tighten its climate targets. Climate activists descended on Shell’s annual shareholder meeting in London today as the oil giant’s board faced one of its biggest climate standoffs. The investor resolution put forward by Dutch climate campaigners Follow This won 18.6% of the vote, according to preliminary results, after securing the support of 27 insitutional investors. The board has called on investors to reject the resolution and back the company’s plan to hold its oil production steady until 2030 while growing its liquified natural gas (LNG) business. The company won the support of 78.2% of shareholders, according to preliminary results. Shell’s chairman, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, said the world “needs more liquefied natural gas, or LNG, which will be a critical fuel throughout the energy transition” and that “oil will play a vital role for a long time to come”. One protester interrupted his speech by calling out: “This is greenwashing. Shell kills.” Activists from Fossil Free London were forcibly removed from the venue after disrupting the AGM by singing “Shell kills” to the tune of Dolly Parton’s Jolene. The group was joined outside the venue by activists from Greenpeace and other green groups. Joanna Warrington, a spokeswoman for Fossil Free London, said: “We peeled back these suits today to reveal the truth: Shell’s senseless oil and gas expansion is nothing short of murder on a mass scale. Behind this AGM and this board are human lives being trampled, from the Niger Delta, to all those babies born this year who will grow up in a dangerously overheating world hurtling towards collapse.” Wael Sawan, Shell’s chief executive, said: “The world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero. Sawan added: “This is why, mindful of our core beliefs around future energy demand, Shell is responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the clean energy system of the future as we transform our business in the coming decades, step by step, focusing on where our strengths lie.” Worryingly, UK manufacturers have been hit by shrinking order books. The CBI reports that order books weakened in the last quarter, with an increase in the number of companies reporting they were “below normal”. The net balance of firms reporting order books as below normal, rather than above normal, increased to a net balance of -33% from -23%. Both total and export order books weakened in May, the CBI reports. More encouragingly, manufacturing output rose in the last three months, and is expected to keep doing so in the current quarter: Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist, says: “While it’s positive to see that manufacturers’ expectations for higher output volumes have finally been realised in the three months to May, this has been accompanied by a sharp deterioration in order books to close to their weakest since January 2021. Manufacturers expect to increase output through the summer months, but any recovery looks set to be fairly gradual, with order books soft and inventory levels relatively high.” “As the economy is starting to show signs of recovery, now is the time to pursue reforms that will boost growth and investment for manufacturers as well as ensuring the UK’s competitive edge globally Former Tory leader Ian Duncan Smith has pushed back against claims made by the City Minister, Bim Afolami, who said that the UK cannot afford to give the “cold shoulder” to China. The original comments were made by Afolami at the City Week conference yesterday (as we covered in this blog), where he suggested that the UK needed to engage with Beijing, if there was any hope of being in control of its economic future. But in response, Duncan Smith, speaking with the Tory think tank Bright Blue, said: “I don’t agree with Bim Afolami on this statement, because I don’t quite know what he means by ‘cold shouldering China’. China has already been ‘cold shouldering’ us, and called us a major threat to their project, and so our question is really going to be, when are we going to wake up to the fact that we are facing a problem in China which we have been building.” Duncan Smith said China was breaking “every single WTO rule in the book” around government subsidies, and trying to flood western markets with electric vehicles. And he said the UK’s efforts to reach net zero should not be outsourced or rely on Beijing. “One of the problems is that the Treasury and the business department and others will always focus on the short-term returns. That’s what happened on that ridiculous golden decade nonsense that was much-loved by George Osborne and co. The main point really is that China has one objective, and this idea that can’t cold shoulder China no one’s asking us to ‘cold shoulder’ China, I’d actually rather like the government to be open-eyed to what is happening.” Despite lifting its UK growth forecasts, the IMF has also poured cold water over the optimistic mood by warning that the government faces difficult choices. So says Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, who explains: “Whilst the IMF has on the one hand claimed a ‘soft landing’ is in sight and upgraded growth forecasts from 0.5% to 0.7% in 2024, it remains downbeat about longer term prospects, citing weak labour productivity and higher than expected sickness levels, as the number of economically inactive due to sickness has topped 2.8m. Labour markets are rightly a real focus of its attention, with persistently high wage inflation potentially acting as a barrier to faster and deeper interest rate cuts, amidst skills shortages, higher inactivity and an ageing population. The IMF rightly highlights that migrant numbers are offsetting this to some degree, even as current policies leave many well-qualified migrants unable to have their credentials recognised in the antiquated UK system. “Encouraging the Treasury to expand the tax net to the tune of £30bn by re-working road taxation, broadening the VAT and inheritance tax base and reforming property taxation, the IMF want to see higher tax receipts to offset the challenge of a growing burden on the public purse, and one it does not believe the UK can currently afford. With taxation already at multi-decade highs at a time of crumbling service provision, news of potentially higher taxes simply to pay for departments at their existing service levels will be bleak reading to many. However, the writing has been on the wall for several years and should come as no surprise to the Treasury, which simply holds itself to fiscal rules that dictate it must bring down borrowing as a percentage of GDP over a rolling five-year basis, a D-day that continuously drifts away and leaves public finances in a permanent state of deniable distress. “The question will be whether the government that takes the reins by early 2025 is ready to be honest with the public that the UK faces a difficult choice – either accept higher taxes are here to stay, for effectively no improvement in service levels, or expect an awful lot less from the state. The reality is of course that no politician is likely to be brave enough to admit this – meaning the UK economy is likely to struggle on with inadequate funding for over-ambitious services and leave voters in a perpetual state of frustration.” Darren Jones MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary, has commented on the IMF’s new economic forecasts for the UK – reminding of the “challenging time” which Jeremy Hunt mentioned this morning. Jones says: “Millions of people are paying more on their mortgages, prices are still rising in the shops and the UK economy has been rocked by a mini-budget that left working families worse off. That is this government’s record and the only way to turn the page and end the Tory chaos is with a Labour government. After all of the economic chaos and decline the Tories have unleashed on the country, they now expect the country to say thank you. Labour’s first steps will deliver economic stability so we can grow our economy in all areas of the country and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible.” Kristalina Georgieva sound cautious when asked about plans to use frozen Russian assets to fund aid for Ukraine. She tells reporters it’s not the IMF’s job to rule on the issue, saying: “It is a matter for jurisdictions that take this decision to agree on what exactly they will and will not do. Georgieva adds that the Fund wants the decision taken “very carefully”, taking into account the possible impacts, including what “unintended consequences” it could bring. G7 nations have been split over how to use around $300bn of Russian assets which were frozen after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Some, including the US and UK, are keen to Last week, Kremlin critic and anti-corruption campaigner Bill Browder urged MPs to introduce a US-style law that would allow the government to confiscate frozen Russian assets to support military efforts in Ukraine. G7 members are set to discuss a proposal to hand Ukraine a loan or bond worth about €30bn, with the interest paid from the profits generated from the frozen assets. Some European policymakers have been worried that handing the frozen assets directly Ukraine would create a legal precedent that could undermine global financial stability. It could also deter other countries from placing their safe haven assets in the West. However, as Browder argued last week, it would also deter countries from invading other countries…. The International Monetary Fund wants the Bank of England to hold a press conference after each Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Currently the MPC meets eight times a year to set UK interest rates, but only holds press conferences four times a year (in February, May, August and November, when it also has new economic forecasts to talk about). IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva says the Bank pledged to look “very carefully” at the Fund’s recommendation for a press conference every time. Georgieva tells reporters at the Treasury: “I believe in a world of more transparency for the sake of trust in institutions. Getting that kind of more regular engagement would help. That’s why we’re making that recommendation.” IMF chief Georgieva says she enjoyed a “warm welcome” in the UK capital today: IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva then explains that Britain needs to do more to strengthen its public finances to prepare for future crises. She points out to reporters in London that the UK, like other rich nations borrowed heavily during and after the Covid-19 pandemic “We are genuinely concerned, not just for the UK, for all countries that have used fiscal buffers extensively, that they must do more to rebuild these buffers. Georgieva adds that there is a simple reason why the IMF is pushing for fiscal prudence: “In a world of more uncertainty, we do not know when there may be again a call on governments have to spend – to have to borrow more to spend more.” Jeremy Hunt has tweeted a couple of photos from the IMF’s visit: IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva says the Fund has three main messages. 1) On monetary policy, she says the Bank of England has reached an inflection point on interest rates. The IMF believes interest rate cuts of 50 basis points to 75 basis points in 2024 “would be appropriate”, she says. That means two, or three, quarter-point cuts to rates. Currently, the City money markets are pricing in two cuts this year, which would bring Bank Rate down from 5.25% to 4.75% by December. 2) On fiscal policy, Georgieva welcomes the government’s measure to boost the labour supply and the permanent capital allowances which allow companies to reclaim tax relief on investment spending. Looking ahead, though, the UK still needs to stabilise public debt and address investment needs in the public sector. Stronger medium-term growth will make that easier, she points out. She suggests several ways to increase growth and productivity: ease planning restrictions to make housing more affordable ease labour mobility encourage business investments. help workers gain new skills 3) On health outcomes. Long-term illness and an aging population are starting to weigh on labour supply, she warns. Georgieva says that the UK labour market is gradually cooling, which should help to lower inflation. Services inflation and pay growth remain high, but are expected to “moderate”, meaning inflation will return “durably” to the 2% target by early 2025. The risks to the inflation outlook are “broadly balanced” she says. For example, energy prices could fall faster than expected, which would lower inflation and boosts growth. IMF chief Georgieva explains that the UK’s stronger than expected growth in January-March, of 0.6%, has allowed the Fund to raise its forecast for growth this year from 0.5% to 0.7%. The International Monetary Fund are presenting their assessment of the UK now, over at the Treasury. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is introducing the Fund’’s top brass now, talking about how the last couple of years have been a “challenging time”. Hunt says: We are very interested to hear what the IMF says about the process we’ve been through. Our big priority is not just stabilisation, but also growth, and increasing our long-term growth rate. Hunt then hands over to IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva. Georgieva starts by saying the IMF’s view is that the actions of the UK authorities – Rishi Sunak, Jeremy Hunt, and the Bank of England – combined with “favourable energy price developments” are “paying off”. Georgieva adds: The economy is growing, inflation is falling, and a soft landing is in sight. BOOM! The International Monetary Fund has signalled its opposition to pre-election tax cuts from Jeremy Hunt as it warned the government of a looming £30bn hole in the UK’s public finances. In its annual health check on the economy, the Washington-based IMF said current spending plans looked unrealistically low and that “difficult choices” lay ahead. The IMF said it would have advised Hunt not to cut national insurance contributions (NICs) by two percentage points in last year’s autumn statement and March budget, and expressed strong doubts about the wisdom of the chancellor’s reported plans for a third cut in NICs before polling day. It said that, in order to stop debt rising, the Treasury may need to consider a range of potentially unpopular revenue-raising measures including widening the scope of VAT, road pricing, scrapping the triple lock on the state pension and wider user charges for public services. The IMF is also warning that the UK economy urgently needs reforms to boost growth, and raise the skills and health of the public. Here’s the IMF’s verdict on the UK, following its regular Article IV visit to London: “With growth recovering faster than expected, the UK economy is approaching a soft landing, following a mild technical recession in 2023. CPI inflation has fallen faster than was envisaged last year and is projected to return durably to target in early 2025.” As monetary policy reaches an inflection point, the timing and pace of rate cuts must carefully balance the risks of premature and delayed easing. Fiscal policy has been appropriately tight, but difficult choices will need to be made over the medium term to stabilize public debt, given significant pressures on public services and critical investment needs. The banking system remains healthy, but continued vigilance of all banks is warranted. Maintaining progress on initiatives to better assess and mitigate risks stemming from non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) is important. Further, ambitious, structural reforms to boost economic potential and living standards are urgently needed, with a focus on easing planning restrictions, addressing skills shortages and improving health outcomes. The UK should also stay the course on climate policies to realize the UK’s ambitious emission reduction targets.” The IMF also warns the Bank of England that it risks hurting the UK economy if it leaves interest rates on hold for too long. Today’s Article IV report says: “Keeping Bank Rate constant as inflation and inflation expectations fall would raise ex-post real rates, which could stall or even reverse the recovery, and lead to an extended undershooting of the inflation target.” Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has welcomed the IMF’s decision to upgrade its growth forecast for the UK, saying: “Today’s report clearly shows that independent international economists agree that the UK economy has turned a corner and is on course for a soft landing. The IMF have upgraded our growth for this year and forecast we will grow faster than any other large European country over the next six years - so it is time to shake off some of the unjustified pessimism about our prospects.” Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has raised its forecast for UK growth this year, following its annual healthcheck on the economy. The Fund also predicts inflation will be sustainably back at the UK’s 2% target next year, having concluded its latest in-depth look at the UK economy. However, is also warns that difficult choices will need to be made over the medium term to stabilize public debt. That could include higher carbon taxes, new levies on road users, or “broadening the VAT and inheritance tax bases, and reforming capital gains and property taxation (more on that in a moment). The IMF is now forecasting the UK will expand by 0.7% this year, up from the 0.5% forecast last month in its World Economic Outlook. It still expects growth of 1.5% next year, as “disinflation buoys real incomes and financial conditions ease.” Following its regular Article IV visit to the UK, the IMF says: “With growth recovering faster than expected, the UK economy is approaching a soft landing, following a mild technical recession in 2023. CPI inflation has fallen faster than was envisaged last year and is projected to return durably to target in early 2025.” This upgrade means the UK is expected to grow as fast this year as France and Italy, who were both forecast to expand by 0.7% last month, and faster with Germany (0.2%), but slower than the US (+2.7%), Japan (+0.9%) and Canada (+1.2%). A ‘soft landing’ means an economy has managed to bring down inflation without falling into a recession. The UK did shrink, slightly, in the second half of last year – but is now growing again. Britain’s retailers are pleased that Mastercard and Visa face a crackdown from the UK payments regulator on the fees they charge merchants (see opening post). Chris Owen, Payments Policy Advisor at the British Retail Consortium, agrees with the Payment Systems Regulator that the market lacks competition, and fees are too high. Owen says: “This report highlights the lack of competition across card schemes, with fees being introduced without justification or sufficient explanation. The 30% increase in scheme fees since 2017 costs businesses an extra £250 million. It’s now time for action. The PSR must implement meaningful reforms to increase competition, increase transparency, and reduce costs in the payment market.” US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen is urging European leaders to respond to China’s industrial policies in a “strategic and united way” alongside the US, to protect manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic. Speaking in Frankfurt today – a week after president Joe Biden announced new tariffs on some Chinese-made goods – Yellen argues that China’s excess industrial capacity is a threat to American and European firms. Yellen warns: “China’s industrial policy may seem remote as we sit here in this room, but if we do not respond strategically and in a united way, the viability of businesses in both our countries and around the world could be at risk.” However, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has indicated she is opposed to the EU copying the US on tariffs against China. Von der Leyen told the Financial Times that Brussels’ approach should be “different” from the US. She said: “Let’s say we share some of the concerns of our American counterparts. [But] our approach is different. The Americans have just applied blanket tariffs. We want competition, we want to trade together, but we want it to be fair and by the rules.” Another UK-listed company is fighting off a takeover bid. XP Power, the Singapore-based maker of power supplies, has rejected three approaches from Advanced Energy Industries of Denver, Colorado. XP told shareholders this morning it had received “a series of highly conditional, opportunistic, indicative proposals from Advanced Energy”, which have all been rejected. The first two approaches was made last October and November, according to Advanced Energy, while the third – valuing XP’s equity at £468m – was made this month. This latter offer values XP at £19.50 per share – this morning, its shares have surged by 48% to £17.26. Pennon Group also says it is paying out about £3.5m in compensation to customers affected by the parasite outbreak in Devon. All customers who were issued with a notice to boil water are receiving compensation of £215 a household, via a bank payment or bill credit. Pennon Group, the water compay behind the waterborne disease outbreak in Devon, has raised its dividend payout for the last year. Pennon, which owns South West Water, Bristol Water and Bournemouth Water, is handing shareholders dividends worth £126.9m for the last financial year, or 135 more than the £111.7m paid out for 2022-2023. This increase is despite Pennon trimming its final dividend payment by £2.4m, to deduct the cost of a court fine for a series of pollution offences. Pennon also reported a 28% surge in statutory operating profits to £140m, although pre-tax profits were flat at £16.8m Susan Davy, Pennon’s chief executive officer, also told the City that 85% of customers now have normal water service again, following the cryptosporidiosis outbreak which has made residents ill and forced schools to close. Davy says: “Whilst the results we are announcing today are based on our performance for the last financial year, we are 100% focused on returning a safe water supply to the people and businesses in and around Brixham. Normal service has returned for 85% of customers, but we won’t stop until the local drinking water is returned to the quality all our customers expect and deserve. Our absolute priority continues to be the health and safety of our customers and our operational teams are working tirelessly around the clock to deliver this. Newsflash: Cazoo, the British online car retailer once-valued at well over £5bn, will reportedly fall into administration on Tuesday. Sky News is reporting that insolvency practitioners from Teneo are expected to be formally appointed today, just over a week after Cazoo filed to seek temporary protection from creditors. More than 700 people have already lost their jobs as a result of the crisis at Cazoo, with the administrators expected to retain a number of staff to operate the remaining marketplace model while they explore a sale. More here. Shares in Cazoo have dropped by 95% in the last year, a painful blow to investors who took part in its flotation on the New York stock exchange in 2021. London investors may be relieved they missed out on this particular IPO…. This month’s slowdown in grocery price increases suggests the cost of living squeeze is easing. But a poll just released by the TUC has found that just 1 in 7 think their living standards are improving this year. The poll of 2,137 adults – carried out by YouGov – found: Nearly 6 in 10 say living standards have not got better this year – with nearly 4 in 10 saying they have got worse Over two-fifths report having to cut back on essentials More than a quarter having to borrow to cover unexpected bills With a sharp drop in inflation expected tomorrow, the TUC argues that claims the economy “has turned the corner” show the government is out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people. The latest growth data, released earlier this month, showed that GDP per head – a measure of living standards – rose by 0.4% in January-March but was 0.7% lower than a year before, having not risen for the previous seven quarters. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak said: “UK households have been hammered by the highest price rises in the G7. So the idea that people should be feeling cheerful for inflation easing is for the birds. “This polling shows how out of touch this Conservative government is with people’s struggles. “The reason this cost of living crisis has hit families so hard is because wages have flatlined over the last 14 years. “Pay packets are still worth less today than in 2008, and working people are on course to end this parliament poorer than at the start. “This a damning indictment of the Tories’ economic record. “We need a new approach – a proper plan to get wages rising by investing in UK industry. And we need a new deal for working people, so they get a fair share of the wealth they create.” Kantar’s latest survey of the grocery sector also found that: Ocado was the fastest growing grocer over the 12 weeks to May 12, with sales up by 12.4% (well ahead of the total online market which grew by 5.4%). Lidl reached a new record-high market share of 8.1%, fuelled in part by its bakery counters, as well as its loyalty scheme, the Lidl Plus app Britain’s biggest grocer Tesco now takes 27.6% of the market, its 5.6% growth in sales matched by Sainsbury’s, which now claims 15.1%. Visa has also responded to the Payment System Regulator’s report, insisting its fees are good value and reflect the cost of offering a secure digital payments system. A Visa spokesperson said: “Visa’s investments in reliable, safe and innovative digital payments mean that everyone in the UK can buy and sell with confidence. This powers economic growth. “Visa’s fees reflect the immense value that we provide to financial institutions, merchants and consumers including extremely high levels of security, near-perfect operational resilience, and a wide range of consumer protections and high-quality products and services that serve consumer and merchant needs.” Newsflash: UK grocery inflation has slowed to its lowest level in two and a half years. Data provider Kantar reports that supermarket prices are 2.4% higher than a year ago this month, down from April’s 3.2%. That’s the lowest level since October 2021, and means grocery inflation is less than a percentage point above its 10-year average of 1.6% between 2012 and 2021. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, says grocery price inflation is gradually returning to more normal levels, after prices soared in the last couple of years. McKevitt explains: “Typically, an inflation rate of around 3% is when we start to see marked changes in consumers’ behaviour, with shoppers trading down to cheaper items when the rate goes above this line and vice versa when the rate drops. “However, after nearly two-and-a-half years of rapidly rising prices, it could take a bit longer for shoppers to unwind the habits they have learnt to help them manage the cost of living crisis. Tomorrow’s UK inflation report is expected to confirm that price rises are slowing, with the Consumer Prices Index expected to fall to 2.1% in April, from 3.2% in March. Mastercard are disputing the Payment Systems Regulators’ findings. A Mastercard spokesperson says: “We disagree with the findings of the PSR’s interim review. The payments industry has never been more competitive, which is reflected in the wide choice of payment options available to British consumers and businesses. “Building and investing in the latest technologies, we power a first-class payments network which consumers, merchants and financial institutions can rely on. In its analysis, the PSR has failed to account for the significant investment required to provide a secure network which prevents billions of pounds of fraud each year. “We consistently deliver on our core promise to people and businesses: providing ways to pay and be paid that are hassle and worry-free, secure and convenient. We will continue to work transparently with the PSR and demonstrate the significant value Mastercard and electronic payments bring to the UK economy.” Chris Hemsley, managing director of the Payment Systems Regulator, explains why the PRS believes the card market isn’t working properly in the UK: “Every time someone uses a Mastercard or Visa card, UK businesses have to pay fees. These fees have significantly increased over recent years, and those increases cannot be explained by improvement in service quality. We have also identified concerns about the transparency and quality of information available to those providing card services to businesses. Competition does not appear to be protecting businesses effectively. “This leads us to provisionally conclude that the market is not working well. “We are consulting on these provisional findings. Should we conclude the market isn’t working well, we are considering remedies aimed at providing businesses and acquirers with more accurate and relevant information about the card services they use. The remedies would also increase transparency around Mastercard and Visa’s UK operations, allowing the PSR to better hold them to account.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Mastercard and Visa do not face effective competition when dealing with merchants and banks in the UK, Britain’s payments watchdog warns today, leading to higher prices. The Payment Systems Regulator says, in a new, provisional report, that the supply of scheme and processing services “is not working well” for “acquirers” – the financial institution, such a bank, that acts as an intermediary between merchants and card payment networks. The PRS warns that there is currently no effective competition preventing Visa and Mastercard raising prices – indeed, the two card providers have raised fees by more than 30% in real terms over the last five years. “There is little evidence that the quality of service has improved at the same rate,” says the PSR, sternly. UK businesses have little choice but to pay increased fees, it adds, as Mastercard and Visa cards account for 95% of transactions using UK-issued cards. The PRS says: In respect of core scheme and processing services, there is currently no effective competition to Mastercard and Visa. In some optional services, competition and choice is limited and alternative providers, when present, cannot match the schemes’ one-stop shop solution for core and optional services. Faced with this seemingly failing market, the PSR is seeking views – and also proposes a number of potential remedies to help businesses v They include: improved transparency so that businesses and acquirers can make informed decisions and are more able to switch to alternative suppliers of optional services obligations on Mastercard and Visa to explain, consult on and/or document the reasons for price changes and the pricing of new services greater reporting of financial information to the PSR on an on-going basis to improve scrutiny of Mastercard and Visa’s UK operations going forward. Also coming up today The International Monetary Fund is in town in London today, to give its annual assessment of the UK economy.

This will be the final healthcheck on the nation’s economy before the general election, and the Fund will have put chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s fiscal plans tax cuts under their microscope. Last month, IMF officials said their team would look closely at whether tax increases or spending cuts would be needed after the general election…..

        "title": "Jeremy Hunt looks to cut NICs again despite IMF warning of £30bn fiscal hole",
        "content": "Jeremy Hunt is preparing a pre-election cut in national insurance despite a warning from the International Monetary Fund of a looming £30bn hole in the public finances, Downing Street has indicated. Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson said the government rejected the IMF’s argument that there was no room for a third cut in NI in less than a year and that the Treasury should instead be thinking about tax increases or spending cuts. “I think on that we respectfully disagree with the IMF,” the spokesperson said. “My view is that cutting national insurance, rewarding work, is an important part of growing the economy.” Downing Street was responding to the release of the IMF’s annual health check on the UK in which it said “difficult choices” lay ahead. Speaking at a press conference, Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said a cautious approach to tax cuts was needed because the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had damaged the public finances. “We are genuinely concerned, not just for the UK, for all countries that have used fiscal buffers extensively, that they must do more to rebuild these buffers,” she said. The IMF said it would have advised Hunt not to cut national insurance contributions (NICs) by two percentage points in last year’s autumn statement and March budget, and expressed strong doubts about the wisdom of the chancellor’s plans for another cut in NICs before polling day. It said that in order to stop debt rising, the Treasury may need to consider a range of potentially unpopular revenue-raising measures including widening the scope of VAT, road pricing, scrapping the triple lock on the state pension, raising more from inheritance tax and capital gains tax, and wider user charges for public services. Georgieva said the economy was on course for a “soft landing” after a faster-than-expected fall in the annual inflation rate and the end of last year’s shallow recession. The IMF believes the UK will grow by 0.7% this year rather than the 0.5% it had estimated in last month’s World Economic Outlook. With the Bank of England contemplating whether to cut interest rates next month from their current 5.25%, the IMF said it saw scope for two or three 0.25 percentage point cuts in official borrowing costs this year. But it said the longer-term growth prospects for the economy remained poor and that this – coupled with demands for better public services and “critical investment needs” – put pressure on the public finances. A team of IMF officials has been in the UK for the past two weeks for the annual Article IV consultation and said in a concluding statement: “In light of the medium-term fiscal challenge, staff would have recommended against the NIC rate cuts, given their significant cost. “But staff does recognise the potential labour supply benefits of the NIC cuts and that they were accompanied by well-conceived measures (eg reform of the ‘non-dom’ regime) that will partially offset their fiscal cost over the medium term.” The statement said that “as a general principle, staff would advise against additional tax cuts, unless they are credibly growth-enhancing and appropriately offset by high-quality deficit-reducing measures”. Government plans involve day-to-day departmental spending rising by 1% a year when adjusted for inflation, and for investment spending to be flat. The IMF said these did not “sufficiently account for known pressures in public services (especially health and social care), and critical growth-enhancing investment needs (including for the green transition)”. The IMF team said it was assuming higher increases – 2% real growth – in departmental spending, but that this would result in debt as a share of national income continuing to rise, reaching 97% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of the decade. The IMF said that, to be certain of stabilising debt by 2029-30, the government would need to raise revenue or make savings equivalent to one percentage point of GDP – roughly £30bn – and that this would involve “tough choices”. Hunt said: “Today’s report clearly shows that independent international economists agree that the UK economy has turned a corner and is on course for a soft landing. “The IMF have upgraded our growth for this year and forecast we will grow faster than any other large European country over the next six years – so it is time to shake off some of the unjustified pessimism about our prospects.”",

        "title": "Devon parasite outbreak: anger as South West Water increases dividend ",
        "content": "The owner of South West Water has said normal service has been restored for 85% of its customers after unsafe drinking water led to more than 100 cases of a waterborne disease in Devon, as it raised its dividend payout to shareholders. After cryptosporidium, a disease that can cause unpleasant symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting, was detected in the water supply in the Brixham area of Devon last Wednesday, 17,000 households and businesses were told by South West Water not to use their tap water for drinking without boiling and cooling it first. Pennon Group, the owner of South West Water, said it had offered all customers issued with a notice to boil water compensation of £215 a household via a bank payment or bill credit, costing it £3.5m. The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed 46 cases of cryptosporidium infection in the Brixham area, while more than 100 other people have reported symptoms, including diarrhoea, stomach pains and dehydration. Two people were taken to hospital after the parasite outbreak, the environment secretary, Steve Barclay, confirmed on Monday, saying that situation had caused “considerable concern and disruption to the local community”. Hospitality and tourism businesses in Devon have had bookings cancelled. On Saturday, South West Water lifted the boil water notice for 14,500 properties in Brixham but apologised after including 28 properties whose water supply was still not safe, causing anger among residents. They were told they could drink tap water, only to receive another message hours later advising them to keep boiling it. The company blamed a problem with its digital map system for the error and said it offered an extra £75 compensation to people given the wrong advice. Susan Davy, the chief executive of the FTSE 250-listed Pennon, said: “We are 100% focused on returning a safe water supply to the people and businesses in and around Brixham. “Normal service has returned for 85% of customers, but we won’t stop until the local drinking water is returned to the quality all our customers expect and deserve.” She said the company’s operational teams were “working tirelessly around the clock to deliver this”. Davy added that Pennon had cut its final dividend by £2.4m, equivalent to South West Water’s record court fine last year, “signalling that we are listening”. However, the total dividend payout is still up from last year, at 44.37p a share or £126.9m – compared with £111.7m a year earlier. Gary Carter, a national officer at the GMB union, said: “These people have no shame. Their water is so dirty it’s literally putting people in hospital, yet the top brass see fit to hand themselves yet another payout. “They way water companies are behaving – it’s like they actively want the public to hate them. Water privatisation has been a catastrophic failure for this country.” Anthony Mangnall, the Conservative MP for Totnes, said on X: “Completely unacceptable to see South West Water’s parent group paying out dividends. This tin-eared offering is smack in the face to those who have been so badly impacted by SWW. I suggest that they either suspend the dividend offering or the CEO Susan Davy steps down.” South West Water provides water and sewage services to 1.8 million residents in Devon, Cornwall and small parts of Dorset and Somerset. The company was fined £2.15m last April for pumping sewage into rivers and the sea in a series of incidents across Devon and Cornwall over four years, caused by “numerous common deficiencies” in the implementation of that company’s management systems, according to the Environment Agency. Pennon reported an underlying profit before tax of £16.8m for the year to 31 March, the same as the previous year, and a statutory loss of £9.1m. Underlying revenues rose by 10% to £908m, boosted by inflation-linked bill increases. Its debt pile swelled to £3.5bn as of the end of March, up from £3bn a year earlier. Analysts expect the company’s revenues to benefit from the increases to bills and also last year’s £380m acquisition of Sutton and East Surrey Water.",

        "title": "‘It’s not vital to spend five days a week in the office’: the bank boss who works from home",
        "content": "At a time when banking bosses from Wall Street to Canary Wharf have been cracking down on working from home, Santander UK’s chief executive remains an outlier. While Goldman Sachs’s David Solomon has described home working as an “aberration”, and JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon calls himself a “skeptic” of the trend that took off during the pandemic, Mike Regnier made home working a condition of taking the job in 2022. He says he would have turned down the Spanish-owned lender had it refused to let him work from his family home in Harrogate, Yorkshire, where he has lived since the early 2000s. Two years after taking the reins, Regnier still works from home one to two days a week, and has been even more lenient with Santander’s 19,000 UK staff, with office-based workers only expected to be onsite two days a week. “I don’t think it’s absolutely vital that people spend all five days a week in the office as they did pre-Covid,” Regnier says from his sixth-floor office near Euston station in London. “And, actually, had it not been for Covid, I wouldn’t have accepted this job, because I wouldn’t have wanted to be away from home five days a week in London. That wouldn’t have been good for the family or for me.” This has helped Regnier, who is paid £3.3m to run the UK’s fifth-largest bank, gain a reputation as an “approachable” boss, according to a former colleague. The 52-year-old’s approach reflects time he lost with his own father, who, as an oil economist, would spend hours commuting by train to London from Leatherhead in Surrey. “He was an amazing father. One of those people who’s extremely hard-working and felt that was the most important thing in life. So [he was] not absent, but I probably didn’t see as much of him as my kids see of me now.” Regnier, a father of two teenagers, made the move to Yorkshire 20 years ago after he and his wife decided they did not want to raise children in London. After an early career in consulting, he found a senior job with Asda, before former Boston Consulting Group colleagues convinced him to switch sectors and join a fast-growing and – at the time – successful bank in Halifax. “So I went to go and work in 2006 for HBOS. What could possibly go wrong?” It went spectacularly wrong. Halifax Bank of Scotland’s bosses at the time – who regulators said had driven a culture of growth at all costs – accumulated £45bn in bad debts that required a £20bn taxpayer bailout after an emergency takeover by Lloyds TSB in 2008. The change under Lloyds was palpable, Regnier says, with its then chief executive Eric Daniels running a “more measured culture” where power was not held tightly at the very top. “The biggest thing I learned from that time was the importance of good culture in the banking sector,” Regnier says. He then went on to join a spun-out TSB – which Lloyds had had to give up in exchange for taking state aid during the financial crisis – but was looking for an out. “That was going to be another couple of years of integration hell”, as TSB tried to extricate itself from Lloyds’ IT platform, he says. So when he was asked to join Yorkshire building society, where he was told he would have a shot at becoming chief executive, he leapt at the chance. But Regnier never intended to go into financial services, and originally wanted to follow in the footsteps of his paternal grandfather, Carlos Regnier: an engineer notable for designing his own two-seat plane that his grandson says was “remarkably similar” to the Spitfire that launched a few years later. However, Regnier’s father told him that “in the UK, it’s accountants who run industry”, resulting in him taking a combined engineering, economics and management degree at Oxford. That was later followed by a master’s in business at France’s Insead, where he met other future City figures including the Prudential Regulation Authority’s chief executive, Sam Woods. That route served him well, and after three years as chief commercial and then chief customer officer, he was appointed chief executive of Yorkshire building society, where he held the role for five years, between 2017 and 2021. While he loved working for a customer-owned lender, he felt isolated. “In a listed company, you’ve got investors who are constantly telling you what they want you to do, and constantly telling you where you’re falling short. And that kind of external stimulus is very useful. You don’t have that in a building society; you have to find it yourself.” He certainly found external motivation once he joined Banco Santander, run by its “formidable” executive chair Ana Botín. Not only does he have to chase strong UK profits to appease his bosses, but must compete for capital against the group’s other international operations in countries such as Brazil and Mexico. That has put UK regulation and the country’s competitiveness front of mind, pushing Regnier to call for big changes from both Conservative and Labour leaders, which could help open up new funding opportunities for his bank post-election. “The really important thing I would urge any government to do is to make bold policy moves that make sense. And then those need to be funded. We need to find a way of standing behind those commitments, but particularly the green transition. Decisions are needed, and then money’s needed.” CV Age 52 Family Married with two teenage children. Education Engineering, economics and management degree at Oxford; MBA at Insead.

        "title": "AstraZeneca aims to nearly double revenues to $80bn by 2030",
        "content": "Britain’s biggest drugmaker, AstraZeneca, has set out a bold ambition to reach $80bn (£63bn) in revenues by 2030 from treatments for cancer, rare diseases and other conditions, by launching 20 major new medicines before the end of the decade. As the company presented its growth plans to shareholders at its labs and corporate headquarters in Cambridge, England, its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said 12 of the 20 new drugs would have the potential to generate more than $5bn in annual revenues at their peak, including five cancer treatments. The Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company made revenues of $45.8bn last year, achieving a year early the goal it had set out as part of its defence against a £70bn hostile takeover approach from US rival Pfizer in 2014. “Today AstraZeneca announces a new era of growth,” Soriot said. “The breadth of our portfolio together with continued investment in innovation supports sustained growth well past the end of the decade.” He added that the firm’s strong position in emerging markets would be vital to achieving its growth targets. It is the largest drugmaker by sales in China and has a major research and development centre in Shanghai. With Soriot at the helm, AstraZeneca has revamped its drugs pipeline and developed a strong portfolio of cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory and rare disease medicines. However, its share price growth has been sluggish in the past year, slowing to just under 2%. Its best-selling diabetes pill, Farxiga, starts to lose patent protection from next year, and revenues in the industry will also come under pressure from reforms that will enable the US government to negotiate drug prices for the first time. Earlier this month, UK drugmaker said it had begun the worldwide withdrawal of its Covid-19 jab due to a “surplus of available updated vaccines”. Its vaccine, which saved more than 6.5 million lives according to independent estimates, cannot be adapted to new variants as easily as the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots, which are based on mRNA technology. On Monday, AstraZeneca announced plans to build a $1.5bn factory in Singapore to manufacture a promising new generation of cancer-killing drugs called antibody-drug conjugates. They are engineered antibodies that bind to tumour cells and release chemicals that kill those cells without damaging surrounding healthy tissue. The company is also making a push into the weight-loss drug market with an obesity and diabetes pill it licensed from China’s Eccogene in November. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said AstraZeneca was “reaching for the stars” with its new sales target, which sent its shares up by 1.2%, making them the second-biggest riser on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday. Mould added: “An easy way for AstraZeneca to achieve such a goal would be to go on a spending spree and buy up rival companies. However, AstraZeneca implies it will hit the goal through organic means which would be all the more impressive. “Chief executive Pascal Soriot is no stranger to controversy over the scale of his pay packet so perhaps he is trying to justify the large renumeration with the new growth plan. Achieving the goal would imply significant value generation for shareholders and no doubt himself given that part of his bonus scheme will be based on company performance.” Soriot is in line for a maximum pay package of £18.7m this year, which was described by the High Pay Centre thinktank as “excessive” and sparked a shareholder rebellion last month. Mould warned that developing new medicines is not an easy task, as there is a high failure rate, and revenues of medicines are drastically reduced once patents expire, allowing generic drugmakers to produce cheaper versions.",

        "content": "Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary, has urged the EU to intervene urgently to dampen the growing export levels of Chinese cut-price green technology including solar panels and wind turbines, pushing European leaders to move to a full-scale trade war. At the same time she urged German bank executives on Tuesday to step up efforts to comply with sanctions against Russia and shut down efforts to circumvent them to avoid potential penalties themselves that could see the US cut them off from dollar access. Her remarks, in Frankfurt, come just hours after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, gave her strongest hint yet that the EU would join the US and impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles after a soon-to-be completed investigation into alleged state subsidies into the automotive industry in China. Yellen said it behoved the US and its western allies to react in a “united way” as China’s growing production was a threat to industries in all their markets. Wind turbine manufacturers in the EU have protested that Chinese rivals are undercutting them by 50% in a move that is appealing to cash-strapped state and regional authorities facing targets in reductions of greenhouse gases. Yellen defended the 100% tariffs, which have been criticised as protectionist and a potential flashpoint that could trigger wider trade wars with China. “China’s industrial policy may seem remote as we sit here in this room, but if we do not respond strategically and in a united way, the viability of businesses in both our countries and around the world could be at risk,” Yellen said at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management on Tuesday. The EU, which sells a greater share of exports to China than the US, is pursuing a policy of de-risking rather than decoupling, and hopes its approach involving investigations into more than 20 trade sectors will focus Beijing’s mind. China has signalled it will retaliate against any tariffs with potential duties on French brandy, EU wine and dairy products. Von der Leyen said Europe would take a different approach to the US. While an increase in tariffs is expected, they are unlikely to match the rate imposed by the US. Von der Leyen told the Financial Times that China had “massive overcapacity” that was “flooding” the EU market with “artificially cheap products”. She said she expected the investigation into alleged Chinese state subsidies launched last September and due to be finished by 5 June, to conclude there were “excessive production subsidies”. The response of the EU would be “that the level of duties would correspond to the level of damage done”, she added, indicating that the EU would not impose import duties of 100%. “It is not about closing the market or protectionism,” she said. The friction with China comes less than two weeks after President Xi Jinping met von der Leyen and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in the hope of persuading him to reduce production levels in China. Yellen’s message on Russian sanctions is believed to be rooted in new evidence seen by the US and EU of circumvention of sanctions by the Kremlin, with goods ordered from multinational tech firms by enterprises in Hong Kong, for instance, ending up in Russia. “Russia is desperate to obtain critical goods from advanced economies like Germany and the US,” Yellen said. “We must remain vigilant to prevent the Kremlin’s ability to supply its defence industrial base, and to access our financial systems to do so.”",

        "title": "Grocery price rises in Great Britain slow as shoppers opt for own-label products",
        "content": "Grocery price inflation in Great Britain has slowed to the lowest level since 2021, while households are still trading down to cheaper products after two and a half years of rapidly rising prices, research has shown. While pressures remain on household budgets, sales of burgers, beer and wine jumped during the bank holiday weekend at the start of May, according to the retail researchers Kantar. It found grocery price inflation had fallen for the 15th month in a row, to 2.4%, the lowest rate since October 2021 and down from 3.2% in April. Fraser McKevitt, the firm’s head of retail and consumer insight, said: “Grocery price inflation is gradually returning to what we would consider more normal levels. It’s now sitting only 0.8 percentage points higher than the 10-year average of 1.6% between 2012 and 2021, which is just before prices began to climb.” While the worst of the cost of living crisis is over, when food and energy bills soared in the double digits, many shoppers are still opting for supermarkets’ cheaper own-label products to save money. McKevitt said: “After nearly two and a half years of rapidly rising prices, it could take a bit longer for shoppers to unwind the habits they have learned to help them manage the cost of living crisis. Own-label lines are proving resilient, for example, and they are still growing faster than brands.” Own-label sales made up more than half of total spending. Sales of premium own-label ranges continued to increase too, up by 9.9% compared with a year ago. During the most recent bank holiday weekend, burger sales climbed 13%, while beer and wine sales shot up by 9% and 21% respectively compared with the previous Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Retailers hope for further increases over the summer, aided by the Euro 2024 men’s football tournament in Germany from mid-June to mid-July, and the Olympic Games in Paris between July and August. McKevitt said: “Major sporting events can have a big impact on grocery sales, particularly in categories like alcohol. During England’s quarter-final match against France in the 2022 Fifa men’s World Cup, take-home beer sales hit their biggest daily takings of the year outside Christmas. Especially if it’s paired with warmer temperatures, this year’s summer of sport could deliver a welcome boost for the sector.” The online grocer Ocado was again the fastest-growing supermarket over the 12 weeks to 12 May when its sales rose by 12.4%. Lidl reached a record market share of 8.1%, fuelled in part by its bakery counters as freshly baked bread, cake and pastries made it into a quarter of baskets over the period. Britain’s biggest grocer, Tesco, and Sainsbury’s also increased their market shares, to 27.6% and 15.1% respectively.",

        "title": "Gina Rinehart tried to hide her portrait – it went global instead",
        "content": "If Gina Rinehart was trying to make sure no one saw a portrait of her, recent moves have had the opposite effect. Last week, media – including Guardian Australia – reported that Australia’s richest woman had demanded the National Gallery of Australia remove a portrait of her. The painting by the artist Vincent Namatjira is one of numerous portraits on display at the Canberra gallery in Namatjira’s first major survey exhibition. But the NGA rebuffed her demands – and news of her request has meant the portrait has been seen by many more eyes than it would have otherwise. Rinehart appears to have fallen victim to the “Streisand effect”, a term coined after Barbra Streisand launched a lawsuit in 2003 to try to remove an aerial photo of her California beach house from an online collection. Streisand’s attempt to suppress the image led to almost half a million people visiting the Pictopia site to view the photo within a month. A similar thing seems to have happened with Rinehart. The NGA told Guardian Australia in a statement that there had been a “noticeable increase” in visitors to the national gallery as well as its digital channels over the past week. Google trends has also given us a sweeping indicator of the worldwide gain in traction of the search term “Gina Rinehart”. Before 15 May – the day the first stories about Rinehart’s portrait demand was published – interest in Rinehart on Google was at roughly 0, meaning there was not enough search data on the term. But after the news broke, search interest picked up, with “Gina Rinehart” hitting peak popularity two days later. A week later, interest lingered. Australia and New Zealand were the top two regions searching “Gina Rinehart”. But interest in the drama has gone global, with Austria, Ireland and Slovenia in the top five. Rinehart’s painting has featured in media around the world. The New York Post jumped on the story on 16 May, as did CNN and the Mirror UK. BBC, the Hindustan Times and South China Morning Post followed suit with coverage on 17 May. Rinehart and her portrait even got a mention on US talkshow The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “A billionaire has called for the removal of an unflattering portrait of her,” Colbert said in a segment on The Late Show. “I mean, come on. How unflattering could this portrait possibly be,” he starts, before taking a look at the painting. “OK, I’ve got to say, um, I’m no art expert, but in this portrait, I believe the artist really captured her expression at the moment she saw this portrait.” A Time magazine headline summarised the situation perfectly just a day after Rinehart’s demand: “An Australian Billionaire Tried to Suppress an Aboriginal Artist’s Unflattering Portrait of Her. It’s Only Drawn More Attention.” After the news of Rinehart’s demand, Namatjira put out a statement. “I paint the world as I see it,” the Archibald prize-winning artist said. “People don’t have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, ‘Why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?’” Meanwhile, Rinehart’s website features a portrait by an unnamed local artist “depicting Mrs Rinehart in her preferred environment” – a soft smile playing upon the mining magnate’s lips as she gazes away from a field of bright buds and the rolling Pilbara hills. (This one is less ruddy-chubby-cheeked, more easy-breezy-beautiful). But which portrait would make it to a billboard? The Australian presenter and comedian Dan Ilic wants to display Namatjira’s portrait in New York’s Times Square – and he has already crowdfunded $17,000 of the $30,000 goal to make it happen.",

        "content": "Telstra has announced it will cut 2,800 jobs when overhauling its enterprise business, with the chief executive, Vicki Brady, saying it was a “very hard day” for the telecommunications giant. Brady, in an announcement to the Australian Stock Exchange, said resetting the Telstra arm that services large businesses and government agencies would lead to a “streamlined product portfolio”, a reduced number of network applications and services products, and simplified customer sales and service. Brady said on Tuesday that the majority of the roles being axed were in the enterprise business, with most to be finalised by the end of 2024. The company said it would consult with the union as part of the changes. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “The actions we are announcing today are difficult, but they are necessary to be a more efficient and sustainable business to ensure we can keep investing at the level required to meet the ever-increasing demand for our connectivity,” Brady told reporters. “The jobs that we will commence consultation on today do not impact our consumer customer service team.” The chief executive said the changes were needed to deal with inflation and higher energy costs – as well as tough market conditions. “Our industry and the world we are operating in are changing. We have new and different competitors. We have rapid advances in technologies happening. Our customer needs continue to evolve and we have ongoing inflationary and cost pressures,” she said. “At the same time, the need for better connectivity right across the country only continues to grow. We continue to see growth in data on our mobile network at 30% per annum.” Brady said the growth in data meant the company needed to make significant ongoing investments in infrastructure. The Communication Workers Union national assistant secretary, James Perkins, rejected Telstra’s claim that the cuts would not affect customer service. “While the detail of where exactly these jobs are being cut from is still unclear, one thing is certain – it will have a devastating impact on services,” he said. “You can’t slash thousands of jobs without seriously impacting the delivery of services across the country. Telstra has to answer to this.” In February, Telstra announced a review of its enterprise business. The review remains ongoing and Telstra said it came amid “challenging market conditions”. As of mid-2023, Telstra had more than 31,000 employees. The company said it expected the restructuring to cost between $200m and $250m in the 2024 and 2025 financial years. The company announced it would stop the annual price review for postpaid mobile plans falling in July and being tied to the consumer price index. Brady would not say what this meant for the price of Telstra plans broadly, but said the company needed to consider a range of factors in its pricing beyond just CPI and there would be no pricing announcement in July.",

        "title": "UK cannot afford to give ‘cold shoulder’ to China, says City minister",
        "content": "The UK cannot afford to give the “cold shoulder” to China, the City minister said on Monday, in comments that will distance the British government from the Biden administration’s protectionist crackdown. Addressing financial services bosses at the City Week conference in London’s Guildhall, Bim Afolami said it was “crucial” to engage with strategic competitors such as Beijing, and that the UK risked losing control of its economic future if it failed to find common ground. “Like with any bilateral relationship, we don’t agree on everything, [but] we are very clear that you simply cannot give the cold shoulder to an economy that is home to a fifth of the world’s globally systemic important banks, four of the world’s largest banks, and almost a third of the world’s leading global financial centres. It just doesn’t make sense,” he said. “Therefore, it is in our interest to engage where we can. [It is] profoundly in our interest to do so.” Afolami said keeping the door open to Beijing would mean the two countries could tackle shared challenges, including the climate crisis, biodiversity loss and ageing populations, together. “Where China is concerned, we are taking the long view.” He stressed that the UK “should only engage, of course, where it’s consistent with our interests. But be in no doubt that is absolutely not the same thing as disengagement.” Afolami added: “If we hesitate too much – as Lord Cameron, the foreign secretary himself, noted two weeks ago – our competitors will write our future for us.” The City minister’s comments will help distance the UK from policies introduced by the US president, Joe Biden, who last week announced more stringent tariffs on $18bn-worth of Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, lithium batteries, critical minerals and semiconductors. The move is meant to protect US manufacturers from cheap imports from China but threatens to inflame trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. Meanwhile, the UK government is continuing to court Beijing and Chinese firms, including the fast-fashion company Shein, which is stepping up preparations for a London listing at a time of dwindling interest in the UK stock market. Shein, which according to one of the sources was valued at $66bn (£52bn) in a fundraising last year, started engaging with the London-based financial and legal advisers to explore a listing early this year, according to reports, after its attempt to float in New York faced regulatory hurdles and pushback from US lawmakers. It could end up being London’s biggest stock market float for years. However, there are still lingering concerns about Chinese interventions in the UK. Two weeks ago, it emerged that 270,000 payroll records belonging to nearly all members of Britain’s armed forces had been exposed to Chinese hackers. The Labour party has said it would launch a “full audit” of the UK’s relations with China if it wins the next election. The UK’s competitive position on the international stage was also addressed on Monday by the London Stock Exchange chief executive, Julia Hoggett, who continued the group’s campaign for higher executive pay. Hoggett praised company board members for sticking their necks out and offering bigger payouts to bosses this year, even if it proved unpopular with some shareholders. It follows a fresh wave of shareholder dissent, including at Smith &amp; Nephew, and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, over multimillion-pound pay increases. “We’ve … seen a far greater willingness of remuneration committees to sit on what I call ‘the naughty step’ by accepting that some resolutions will gather more than 20% of votes cast against them,” she said during a keynote address at the City Week event. Companies that receive at least 20% opposition from shareholders are required to justify their pay decision and are flagged by asset management groups. However, Hoggett suggested that more companies should be jumping onboard. “It remains my belief, however, that this remains more in our hands than we think. As parents, we all know that the naughty step is not a naughty step if everybody’s sitting on it.”",

        "title": "‘Bloody £9 for two!’ How much does an ice-cream cost around the world?",
        "content": "The cost of two ice-cream cones topped with bubble gum has famously risen to £9 in some parts of the UK. With inflation rampant in several countries around the world, is the price of cooling down on a hot day creeping up globally? Australia Soft-serve ice-cream vans are a common sight at the beach on a hot summer’s day. But prices are steep. At Bondi beach in Sydney, a vanilla waffle cone dipped in chocolate will set you back A$6 (£3.15), while a classic waffle flake is A$9 (£4.75). The ice-cream van company Mr Softy said its prices ranged from A$4.50 for a single soft-serve vanilla cone, but could be as much as A$9.50 for a double vanilla scoop with toppings and a sugar waffle cone. Jim Boras, Mr Softy’s director, said that after the Covid pandemic, prices had gone up by a third, with the cost of a single vanilla soft-serve rising from $3.50 to $4.50 owing to increased supplier costs. “Before Covid, we were paying $60 a bucket for the choc-dip bucket, now we’re paying close to $160,” he said. “Our prices are guided by supply … if suppliers don’t increase their prices, we don’t increase our prices, because our main audience is kids.” Sharlotte Thou in Sydney Germany Despite galloping inflation in recent years, German ice-cream prices (try the delectable one-word poem Speiseeispreise) remain affordable compared with those of many European neighbours. A scoop will set you back just €1.72 on average, according to a nationwide survey this spring by consumer magazine Coupons.de. That’s up 6.2% since 2023. Regions vary wildly, however, with Bochum in the Ruhr valley a veritable Schnäppchen (bargain) at €1.40 versus €2.12 in wealthy Munich. In keeping with their ardent love of Italian food, Germans consume an average of eight litres of ice-cream each every year – about 100 scoops. Deborah Cole in Berlin Germans tend to stick to the classics like chocolate, vanilla and stracciatella (gelato with chocolate flakes) but have a few national quirks, including the notorious Spaghettieis. The sundae, credited to the son of Italian immigrants in Mannheim, is a super-sweet concoction resembling a dish of pasta – essentially cognitive dissonance on a plate. It is made by pushing vanilla ice-cream through a Spätzle noodle press until it looks like spaghetti, then slathering it with strawberry sauce to mimic a marinara, and finally topping it with a grated parmesan stand-in – usually coconut flakes or flaked nuts. Ivory Coast This season’s heatwaves in west Africa have made ice-creams a necessary relief, and offered the perfect excuse for indulgence to residents of Abidjan, the commercial capital of Ivory Coast, where the atmospheric mantra is Abidjan est doux (“Abidjan is sweet” in the Ivorian Nouchi slang). Coffee and tiramisu flavours are favourites in a country that remains the world’s largest cocoa producer, but vanilla and passion fruit are also popular. Patisseries such as the French-owned retail chain Des Gâteaux et Du Pain on Rue des Jardins, a seemingly never-ending street of restaurants and cafes in the upmarket Deux Plateaux, sell scoops anywhere between 1,500and 2,000 CFA francs (£2-£2.60) each. Customers seeking more economical prices can head to supermarkets in Marcory Zone 4 and Riviéra districts, where tubs of strawberry and vanilla ice-cream used to cost an average of 2,500 CFA (£3.25) but now cost anywhere from 3,200 to 3,500 CFA (£4.20-4.60) owing to the rise in the price of dairy products. Eromo Egbejule in Abidjan Japan Japan is known for its vast array of unusual ice-cream flavours – whitebait or squid ink, anyone? – but most opt for more conventional varieties: vanilla, chocolate and green tea. A “soft cream” cone from a specialist seller can cost anything from ¥500 (£2.50) to about ¥800 (£4), but most people get their ice-cream fix from supermarkets and convenience stores. If there are ice-cream vans in Japan, I have not seen one in all the years I’ve lived here. The Guardian bought three popular ice-creams from the FamilyMart convenience-store chain: two waffle cones in different flavours, and a Choco Monaka Jumbo: a thin disc of chocolate covered in vanilla ice-cream and encased in a wafer. Despite falling victim to the rising cost of ingredients, the price of regular Japanese ice-creams still puts Mr Whippy to shame: the Waffle Cone Uji Matcha, made with green tea from a tea-growing town near Kyoto, was the most expensive of the three at ¥328, followed by the Waffle Cone Rich Taste Milk &amp; Vanilla at ¥248 and the Choco Monaka Jumbo – the Guardian Japan’s go-to ice-cream – at ¥173. Justin McCurry in Tokyo New Zealand From basic soft-serve cones whipped up in a truck on a hot day, to gourmet offerings from boutique stores, New Zealand is a nation of ice-cream lovers. The country tops the list of ice-cream eaters around the world, at 28.40 liters for each person a year, with vanilla and hokey pokey (a plain vanilla ice-cream with small lumps of honeycomb toffee) among the country’s favourite flavours. The price of an ice-cream cone can vary, depending on the producer. At the cheaper end, The Ice Cream Truck charges NZ$3 (£1.45) for a kid’s cone, $5 (£2.40) for a standard single cone with trimmings and $7 (£3.40) for a double. The company’s owner, Hamish Williams, says his sherbet flavour is his bestseller by far. Williams increased prices by $1 this year amid rising fuel, product and insurance costs, but has kept his kids’ cone prices consistent. “I want to be able to give kids an ice-cream if they do come out with loose change, and if you’ve got three kids you can get them all a treat for under $10.” Boutique ice-cream stores such as Duck Island make small batches using local and seasonal ingredients, which is reflected in their higher prices – $5.50 for a kids’ cone, $7.50 for a single-serve and $10 for a double. The gourmet Auckland-based ice-cream maker Giapo, which boasts superstar fans such as Cher, is at the upper end of the market. Kids’ cones start at $7.50, increasing to $34 for some of Giapo’s more fanciful creations such as a “colossal squid” cone adorned with curling chocolate tentacles. Eva Corlett in Wellington Spain In a country where summer temperatures can climb to a punishing 47.6C (117.7F), it’s a relief to know that an ice lolly or ice-cream can be had from the freezer cabinet of a grocery shop for €1 or €2 (85p-£1.70). The prices rise if you’re after something a little more artisanal – and, naturally, depending on which part of Spain you’re in. The well-known Heladería Sienna, which has been serving Italian gelato to the people of Madrid – and visitors strolling around the capital’s nearby Retiro park – for more than 40 years, offers a long list of choices, including passion fruit and basil, chocolate and dulce de leche, and carrot cake. A small cone will set you back €2.60, a medium one €3.50, and a large one €4.20. Walk for half an hour into Chueca, Madrid’s vibrant LGBTQ+ district, and the prices at the popular Cuban-Dutch-run Labonata are similar, rising from about €2.80 for a small cone to €4.90 for a large one. Those with more adventurous palates – and deeper pockets – can find something cool and challenging, at Parallelo in Barcelona. Tubs of gorgonzola and habanero chilli ice-cream range from €9 to €24, as do tubs of matcha tea ice-cream. Sam Jones in Madrid Thailand Thailand has a huge range of ice-creams, from fruit flavours such as lychee and durian, to sugary Thai tea, but the classic flavour is coconut. It can be eaten with toppings including sweetcorn, sweet potato, peanuts or palm seed, from a cup, cone or encased in bread. Ice-cream is sold at street-vendor carts, in markets or at convenience stores or malls. At a stall in central Bangkok’s Asok area on Monday, prices ranged from 19 baht (42p) for a cone to 39 baht (85p) for a cup. Rebecca Ratcliffe in Bangkok The US Ice-cream has evolved from a luxury item for the wealthy and elite in the 1700s to a staple – first as ice-cream parlours and soda shops were popularised in the early 20th century, and then after cheap refrigeration became widely available. The US even boasts the self-described ice-cream capital of the world – Le Mars, Iowa, which can brag of producing the most ice-cream by one manufacturer in one location globally since 1994, under the Blue Bunny brand. Recently, however, prices have risen, with the retail cost of a half gallon of ice-cream in the US reaching $6.02 in 2023, a new all-time high – and hitting $6.20 (£4.88) in April 2024, according to the Federal Reserve. As prices have trended upwards, demand and consumption for ice-cream in the US has been in decline: on average, an individual American ate around 16lbs (10kg) of full-fat ice-cream in 2000, but this fell to about 12lb annually in 2021. The decline has been attributed to health concerns, worries about the environmental impacts of the dairy industry, the increasing demand for dairy-free options, and the proliferation of smaller, pint-size ice-creams on the market. Despite declines in consumption, dairy ice-cream sales reached about $7bn in 2022.",

        "content": "Time to wrap up… here are today’s main stories: It’s been a fairly lacklustre day’s trading in London, where the FTSE 100 index is up just 6 points or 0.08% today. Precious metals producer Fresnillo is the top FTSE 100 riser, up 4%, even though the gold price has slipped back from this morning’s record high. Budget airline easyJet are the top faller, following rival Ryanair’s prediction that its fares may not rise this summer. The International Monetary Fund is urging Italy to tackle its debts and boost productivity. Following a regular assessment of the Italian economy, the IMF says it has “recovered well” from the shock of high energy prices and the pandemic, due to substantial support and a rebound in tourism. That expansionary fiscal policy which supported Italy’s economy has also kept Italy’s deficit and public debt levels very high, the Fund warns, which is “elevating Italy’s risk premium and acting as a drag on private sector investment.” Urging Rome to take action, the IMF says: Faster than planned fiscal adjustment to reduce debt with high confidence can be achieved with limited cost to growth by withdrawing inefficient and temporary crisis measures. Beyond the near-term, while maintaining a sizable primary surplus, additional fiscal effort will be needed to accommodate growth-enhancing investments and latent spending pressures and help restore fiscal space in the event of severe shocks. Italy ran a budget deficit of 7.2% of GDP last year, more than double the 3% maximum permitted under the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), while its debt pile fell to 137.3% of GDP in 2023. The IMF adds that Italy “urgently” needs to reinvigorate productivity, adding: Full and timely execution of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, followed by a successor medium-term structural fiscal plan that focuses on critical public infrastructure, research and innovation, education system reform, and improving the business climate, would support this goal. Over in Chile, growth has been slightly below forecasts in the first quarter of this year. New economic data shows Chile’s GDP rose by 1.9% in the January-March quarter, missing foreccsts for 2%. Morrisons today announced that it has started a process to reduce its debt load. The supermarket chain is setting aside up to £1,000,000,000 to buy back debt, which has piled up since it was taken over in a private equity buyout. Emma Carr, retail partner at the law firm Gowling WLG, says: “This is a sensible and prudent approach that should allow Morrisons to start rebuilding its prominent space in the competitive and fast-changing dynamics of the supermarket sector at the earliest stage possible. Ensuring that it remains as competitive as possible where customer needs are concerned is key – especially if it wants to attract further investment and return to its rightful place as a prominent player in the sector on the back of being in in touch with these fast-changing needs.” Analysts at HSBC have raised their view on UK stocks to “overweight”, saying shares are undervalued. HSBC give four reasons for their new optimism: First, the FTSE 350 index is cheap relative to its own history and to other markets. Meanwhile, M&amp;A could become a stronger catalyst with total transaction values this year likely to be higher than last. Second, higher commodity prices and bond yields along with US dollar strength are tailwinds for performance. Third, the combined dividend and buyback yield significantly outstrips that of other markets. Fourth, the long-term structural overhang of UK pension fund selling is at an end; they simply have no more UK equities left to sell. HSBC also reckon that a Labour victory in the upcoming general election is unlikely to surprise the market, adding: In the near term, with public sentiment so depressed, it would not take much for optimism to return in our view. Arguably, this note would have been more timely a month ago, before the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares began rallying to record highs…. UK consumer confidence has improved, according to data provider YouGov, as people grow more optimistic about their economic prospects. YouGov’s consumer confidence index, just released, has risen to 108.9 this month, up from 107 in April. Here’s the details: Increases in short-term financial confidence (+2.9) as well as in outlook (+4.4) Perceptions of job security among workers improves for retrospective (+0.6) and forward-looking metrics (+4.1) Mixed bag for business activity, with improvements in outlook (+2.8) but declines over past 30 days (-1.1) Demand for business travel to and from the UK has dropped by nearly a third compared to pre-pandemic levels, as companies have embraced home working and cut back on environmentally damaging measures. Analysis from the New Economics Foundation (NEF) released today shows that flights for business purposes fell by 29 per cent last year compared with 2019, meaning 3.9m fewer trips were made. The NEF also examined data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and found that businesses spent £2.9bn less on air travel in 2023 compared with 2019 (in 2023 prices), a drop of 22%. That, they argue, undermines the aviation industry’s claims that increasing the number of flights will drive economic growth. Alex Chapman, senior economist at the New Economics Foundation, said: Business use of air travel peaked in 2007 and has fallen further since the pandemic. Today, growth causes major damage to our climate while benefiting only a tiny group of airport owners and wealthy frequent flyers. The next UK government should take a fresh look at its approach to travel and tourism, and focus on re-invigorating the UK’s neglected domestic tourism economy and coastal areas and the zero-carbon public transport network which will support them.” The chairman of insurance market Lloyd’s of London has warned that unless clients become more climate resilient, insurance against natural catastrophes is going to become unaffordable. On a panel at the City Week conference this morning, Bruce Carnegie Brown said Lloyd’s of London were happy to continue to provide cover for customers but said insurance was there to deal with unexpected - not predictable - risks. Carnegie Brown said:: “What needs to happen is that customers build more resilience…if insurance is to play a valuable role. Because, simplistically, insurance is there to support unexpected risks and if the risks become expected, then at some point the premium and the claim become the same number, and that’s not particularly helpful for customers. “Another way of looking at it is insurance either becomes unaffordable or unobtainable, so the mitigation on that is to build resilience so that the expectation bar is raised and insurance can keep doing what it does best, which is protecting customers against unexpected risk.” However, he said he recognised that insurance was based on historical data, and if something “exponential” was happening, as it most certainly was with climate, there was a risk that the insurance industry was “permanently behind the curve.” He added: “That is one of the challenges that we are concerned about.” Ben Broadbent told the central banking conference at the Bank of England today that “the experience of the last two or three years” has made policymakers wary of cutting interest rates too early. But Broadbent also points out that the recent behaviour of the UK economy – more in line with the Bank’s forecasts – was “reassuring”. He also produced a chart, which showed that the Bank’s inflation forecasts in 2022 were “wide of the mark”, while recent forecasts have been much more accurate. Broadbent adds: It’s unlikely this is because the MPC has suddenly become brilliant at forecasting (or that it was useless before). It’s simply because there have been fewer large shocks over the past year. One former Bank of England policymaker, Michael Saunders, agrees that the BoE is likely to cut interest rate this summer. In a new research note just released, Saunders says the choice on whether the first cut comes at Bank’s June or August meetings is “narrowly balanced”. Saunders, who left the Bank’s monetary policy committee in 2022 and now works for Oxford Economics, argues that the MPC can move ahead of the US Federal Reserve, for a change, as the UK economy has weaker recent growth and rising spare capacity. He adds: As a result, and in a departure from practice in recent decades, we think the MPC is likely to ease ahead of the Fed in the summer. Here’s the key points from Saunders’ note: Historically, the UK has tended to cut rates slightly after the US central bank. It’s often been tempting – and usually wrong – to argue that “this time is different”. However, we think this time really is different and expect the UK will cut a little before the Fed in coming months, and cut a bit faster over the year ahead. Unlike the US, UK inflation in recent quarters has undershot the central bank’s expectations and is likely to return to target in the next month or two. What’s more, recent economic growth has been much weaker in the UK than the US, and as a result, labour market tightness has faded faster in the UK. For example, unlike the US, the UK vacancy/unemployment ratio is back to pre-pandemic levels. To be sure, the UK is sensitive to external monetary policy decisions and prospects. But the Bank of England would not be alone if it eased before the Federal Reserve. The Swiss National Bank and Sweden’s Riksbank have already done so, and the European Central Bank is likely to cut in early June. We expect the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee will cut rates soon, with a narrowly-balanced choice between June and August for the first cut and rates falling by 75bps by year end. This is a little earlier than our forecast for US easing, with a first cut expected in September and rates coming down by 50bps by year end. The latest UK inflation data, due on Wednesday, will help determine when the Bank starts to cutting interest rates. Economists predict a big fall in the annual inflation rate, down to 2.1% for April from March’s 3.2%. That would mean it had nearly dropped to the BoE’s 2% target. Energy prices will have a downward impact on the inflation rate, after Britain’s energy price cap was lowered last month, while food price inflation is also slowing rapidly. James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, says the measure of services inflation will determine whether the first rate cut comes in June or August. Smith explains: We think services inflation could come in hotter than expected, and if we’re right, that would favour another ‘on hold’ decision next month. City economists predict annual services inflation will slow to 5.5% for April, down from 6% in March. Speaking of not giving China the cold shoulder….. Sky News are reporting that Sajid Javid, the former chancellor of the exchequer, has been approached about taking a role at Shein, the online fashion giant which is progressing plans for London’s biggest stock market float for years. They say that Javid is among a number of senior City figures who have held talks with Donald Tang, Shein’s executive chairman, in recent weeks. Sky News’s Mark Kleinman adds: City sources said that if the appointment of Mr Javid proceeded, it could see him either join Shein’s board or become an adviser to the Chinese-founded company. They added that Baroness Fairhead, the former BBC Trust chair, was also on a list of candidates drawn up by headhunters advising Shein. One person close to the company said the identities of those being approached reflected both the seriousness with which Shein was taking the issue of corporate governance and the extent of its focus on a London listing. Back at the CityWeek conference in London, the FCA has tried to assure City bosses that the regulator will take time and care in deciding whether to charge ahead with so-called ‘naming and shaming’ proposals, where the regulator would announce who it is investigating, earlier on in the process. While public notification is common in some other industries, it has caused a stir in the City and backlash from the Treasury. However, Sarah Pritchard, an FCA executive director in charge of markets and international matters, told the CityWeek conference: “I know that there have been some concerns around our proposals to announce the fact of some enforcement investigations earlier on in the process where it’s in the public interest to do so. Now we recognise that this is a sensitive and emotive issue, so we will take time to consider the feedback to engage further with industry and explore thoroughly the concerns and evidence shared with us with the aim of reaching a broad consensus. Be assured that we do listen. We are evidence led and so will only act when a failure to do so would cause harm to consumers and undermine the integrity of our markets.” Whether that will do anything to assuage concerns in the City, though, remains to be seen. Ben Broadbent’s speech makes several interesting points about the UK economy. He shows how the openness of the UK economy means its more sensitive to global shocks, with a chart outlining how at least 90% of variations in UK growth over the past fifteen years have been caused by “foreign (or at least common) shocks”. He also outlines how the surge in global trade and openness came to an end well over a decade ago: And this chart shows how most of the rise and fall in UK inflation can be accounted for by swings in prices of tradeable goods (such as energy products, manufactured goods, and food). That may mean that there is less inflationary pressure to come. Broadbent says: Clearly, the tighter labour market also mattered. But the vast majority of the inflation seems to reflect the direct impact first of higher core tradeable goods prices following the pandemic, then those of energy and food after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In particular, it’s really only in the past year, as those direct effects have fallen back, that any material “second-round effects” on domestic inflation have begun to emerge. Ben Broadbent’s speech is his thirty-eighth, and last one, since he joined the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee in 2011 He tells his audience at the Bank today that the UK economy was hit by several large, global shocks during those 13 years, which affected supply and costs more than demand. As Broadbent puts it: It’s certainly been an eventful time. I joined the Committee in 2011, when the economy was still feeling the effects of the global financial crisis (GFC) three years earlier. That was then followed by the Euro area debt crisis, which perpetuated the credit squeeze in this country. After a period of relative calm we then went through the EU referendum and the negotiations that ensued, followed at the start of the current decade by the enormous effects of the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine. He then reminds us that former governor Mervyn King once described the years preceding the GFC as the “NICE” decade (standing for “Non-Inflationary and Consistently Expansionary”). Broadbent suggests he has lived through a NASTY time, saying: I’m not sure how one would characterise the period since (“Not-AS-Tranquil Years”?). But, if his description was designed as a warning that we couldn’t expect such stability to last indefinitely, he’s certainly been proved right. Newsflash: The Bank of England’s outgoing deputy governor has suggested that UK interest rates could be cut this summer. Ben Broadbent, the Bank’s deputy governor for Monetary Policy, said in a speech this morning that if the economy evolves as expected, borrowing costs could possibly be lowered this summer. Broadbent explained that the direct effect on inflation of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war have now faded – what matters now is how long the effects of that earlier surge on domestic inflation linger. Broadbent explains that the nine members of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee must assess how those “second-round effects” in domestic prices and wages change. One argument is that these second-round effects will take longer to unwind than they did to emerge. The alternative view is that firms are less able to pass on higher wages to their customers through increased prices. He says: There is a range of views across the Committee on this point. In view of the rarity of events like this over the past, and the associated uncertainty about the future, that’s entirely understandable. Whatever the priors of its individual members the MPC will continue to learn from the incoming data and, if things continue to evolve with its forecasts – forecasts that suggest policy will have to become less restrictive at some point – then it’s possible Bank Rate could be cut some time over the summer. This month, the MPC voted 7-2 to leave interest rates at their current 16-year high of 5.25%, with Broadbent one of seven members who opted for ‘no change’. The money markets currently indicate that there’s a 57% chance that rates are lowered to 5% at the Bank’s next meeting in June, while a cut by August is almost fully priced in. Broadbent himself will only get one more chance to vote for a cut, at the June meeting, as he is leaving next month and will be replaced by Clare Lombardelli, the chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), on 1 July. The London Stock Exchange CEO Julia Hoggett has continued the bourse’s campaign for UK companies to offer higher - and what they claim is more globally competitive - executive pay. Speaking to attendees of the CityWeek conference today, Hoggett praised company board members for sticking their necks out and offering bigger payouts to bosses this year, even if it proved unpopular with some shareholders. “We’ve also seen a far greater willingness of remuneration committees to sit on what I call ‘the naughty step’ by accepting that some resolutions will gather more than 20% of votes cast against them, thus requiring an explanation from the company under the corporate governance code and inclusion in the IA’s [Investment Association] public register. This creates an arbitrarily high 80% threshold for resolutions, which is something that CMIT [Capital Markets Industry Taskforce] has called to be removed. Although we’ve started to see a change in mindset from some very significant asset managers, such that the number of companies with significantly enhanced remuneration packages have, nevertheless, this season received 80% support.” She also suggested that more companies should be hiking pay - since the consequences of doing so would be less problematic if every boardroom was moving in the same direction: “It remains my belief, however, that this remains more in our hands than we think. As parents we all know that the naughty step is not a naughty step if everybody’s sitting on it.” The UK and its financial services sector cannot afford to give the “cold shoulder” to China, the City minister has warned. Speaking at the CityWeek conference in London this morning, Bim Afolami told attendees that it was “crucial” to engage with strategic competitors like China. “Like with any bilateral relationship, we don’t agree on everything. We are very clear that you simply cannot give the cold shoulder to an economy that is home to a fifth of the world’s globally systemically important banks, four of the world’s largest banks, and almost a third of the world’s leading global financial centres. Therefore, it is in our interest to engage where we can …[and it is ] profoundly in our interest to do so.” He said of course the UK was taking a “long view” and should only engage where it is “consistent with our interests’. But, he echoed a warning that he said was made by foreign secretary David Cameron, saying that if UK and business hesitated too much, “our competitors will write our future for us.” He also said that the UK’s success needed to be reflected in regulation, and repeating punchy comments made earlier this year: “There is no point in us having the safest graveyard.” Afolami’s comments come two weeks after it emerged that 270,000 payroll records belonging to nearly all members of Britain’s armed forces have been exposed to Chinese hackers. The Labour party has said it would launch a “full audit” of the UK’s relations with China, if it wins the next election. AstraZeneca has announced plans to build a $1.5bn facility in Singapore where it will manufacture anti-cancer products. The factory, which Astrazeneca hopes to open by 2029, will make antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) – molecules which deliver cancer-killing agents directly to cancer cells through a targeted antibody. Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca, says Singapore is one of the world’s most attractive countries for investment given ““its reputation for excellence in complex manufacturing”. Png Cheong Boon, chairman of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), says he’s looking forward to a successful partnership with AstraZeneca. “We welcome AstraZeneca’s decision to establish a manufacturing presence in Singapore for the first time. It will also be a first for AstraZeneca - an end-to-end manufacturing facility for novel antibody drug conjugates that enables precision therapy for cancer. This greenfield investment is a strong show of confidence in Singapore’s biopharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities and talent, strengthens our ecosystem in supporting the development and manufacturing of precision medicines, and creates meaningful jobs and economic opportunities for Singapore. The price of both copper and gold have hit record levels today. Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange rose by 4% at one stage to a new alltime high of $11,104.50. Fears of supply shortages have pushed up the price of copper – an essential component in renewable energy systems – in recent weeks. Better-than-expected factory data from China, and Beijing’s efforts to prop up its property sector, have also helped push copper up. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says: Fresh Chinese stimulus measures aiming to address the country’s heavily bleeding property market, and the latest – and better-than-expected – rebound in Chinese industrial production also support the rally in commodity prices. Spot gold has climbed to a new peak of $2,499.89 per ounce, meaning it has gained around 25% since February. Gold has been rallying amid speculation that the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, will cut interest rates once or twice this year. Demand for gold has also been pushed up by some central banks, such as the People’s Bank of China, which has been adding to its bullion reserves for months. Nickel prices are also rising today, up over 4% in China. Last week Nickel hit a near nine-month high after political violence broke out in New Caledonia, which holds some of the world’s biggest nickel deposits. In the City, shares in video game services company Keywords Studios have surged by nearly two-thirds this morning after confirming it is in takeover talks. Keywords told shareholders this morning that it is in advanced discussions with European private equity group EQT over a possible cash offer of 2,550p per share. Dublin-headquartered Keywords also reveals it has turned down four previous offers, which it viewed as too low. But this new proposal is “at a value that the Board would be minded to recommend” to shareholders, if a firm offer was made, it says. Shares in Keywords, which provides services to help develop computer games, have jumped by 62% to 2374p, from 1470p on Friday night, close to EQT’s offer. EQT now has until 5pm on 15 June to make a formal offer for Keywords, or must walk away for six months. Happily for holidaymakers, flight prices may not rise much this summer. Budget airline Ryanair says it is “cautiously optimistic” that peak summer fares this year will be “flat to modestly ahead of last summer”. Ryanair reports that recent pricing has been “softer than we expected”, requiring it to make more cuts to pricing in the last quarter than a year ago to fill its seats. CEO Michael O’Leary told an investor presentation: “It is a bit surprising that pricing hasn’t been stronger and we’re not quite sure whether that’s just consumer sentiment or recessionary feel around Europe but we still see peak travel demand certainly through July and August being strong. “And if we have to discount or cut fares to fill to 94% load factor in April, May and June then so be it.” The airline has also reported a 34% rise in profits after tax to €1.92bn (£1.64bn) for the year to the end of March, with passenger numbers up 9% despite disruption to Boeing aircraft deliveries (which had been expected to push up flight costs this year). Ryanair has also added former MP Amber Rudd, the ex-Home Secretary, to its board. UK rents are also climbing, particularly for tenants who are renewing their rental agreements. Hamptons has reported that tenants renewing an existing contract in Great Britain saw their rent rise by an average of 8.3% over the last 12 months, outpacing rental growth on a newly let property (6.4%). But despite that squeeze,tenants who stay put and renew their contract are still paying 13.4% or £178 pcm less on average than someone who moved into a new home. Aneisha Beveridge, Head of Research at Hamptons, says: “Many tenants had enjoyed years of no or below-inflation rent increases, particularly when rents weren’t rising much on the open market and mortgage costs were falling. Landlords were often content with a small gap between the market rate for their home and what their tenant was paying. However, over the last two years, strong rental growth on the open market has meant that the gap between market rates and what some tenants were paying rose significantly. “Tenants fortunate enough to be protected from higher rents by their landlord or longer contracts are increasingly seeing their rents rise. These increases for renewing tenants tend to be lower and stretched over a longer period than for newly let homes, often meaning tenants still pay below market rate. But even so, these hikes can still add up to hundreds of pounds a month. “The large gap between market rates and what many tenants are paying is a big disincentive for them to move unless they have to. Moving increasingly means getting less home for more money. While time will eventually close the gap between what sitting and new tenants are paying, it may take longer if rental growth on the open market starts picking up again.” These charts highlight how average asking prices have picked up this spring, after a lull at the end of 2023: Remarkably, Rightmove also reckon that people hoping to sell their home and move before Christmas (!) should start taking action now. They report that it is taking 62 days on average to find a buyer before the legal process of selling the house even begins. And with the average time between agreeing a sale and legal completion currently “a painful five months”, or 154 days, it is taking over seven months on average from a seller coming to market to completing their move. Rightmove’s Tim Bannister says the “extremely lengthy legal completion process” is a frustrating barrier for home movers to get over. Bannister explains: It may seem surreal to be thinking about Christmas in May, but we know that many would-be sellers picture celebrating the festivities in a new home, and to achieve that, now is the time to be coming to market. One strategy that is still giving some sellers the edge in this price-sensitive market, is working closely with an estate agent to price attractively right at the start of marketing, to give themselves the best chance of finding a buyer quickly. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The spring selling season is picking up speed in the UK housing market, where asking prices for homes has risen to a record level. Online property portal Rightmove reports this morning that the average price of property coming to the market for sale hit a new record of £375,131 in the last month, up 0.8% on April. However, that only leaves average asking prices 0.6% higher than a year ago. Today’s data shows that activity has picked up this year, with 17% more sales in the first four months of 2024 than in 2023 despite the Bank of England maintaining base rate at 5.25% since last August. Rightmove reckons that “pent-up demand from would-be buyers” who dropped out of the market last year is now driving the market, even though mortgage rates have remained high for longer than expected. Asking prices are not the same as selling prices, of course – recent data has shown a drop in sales prices. Last month, several leading UK lenders raised their fixed-rate mortgage deals, but this has started to reverse with some lenders cutting rates last week. Rightmove reports that price growth is being driven by the top-of-the-ladder properties, where asking prices are 1.3% higher than last year. These properties tend to be less sensitive to high mortgage rates.

        "title": "UK interest rate cut is ‘possible’ this summer, says Bank of England deputy",
        "content": "UK interest rates could be cut this summer, the Bank of England’s outgoing deputy governor said on Monday, adding to the expectation that a first reduction in borrowing costs could come as soon as next month. Ben Broadbent, the Bank’s deputy governor for monetary policy, said that if the economy evolves as expected, borrowing costs could possibly be lowered “some time over the summer” in response to a steep fall in inflation. Broadbent said the main drivers of inflation over the past two years – the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war – had faded and the Bank was watching to check whether the longer-term domestic effects on prices would also decline before making a first cut in interest rates. He said the monetary policy committee’s (MPC) nine members must assess how those “second-round effects” in domestic prices and wages change the course of inflation over the next two years. Analysts have diverged over the likelihood of a rebound in inflation later in the year, possibly forcing the Bank to pause its plans for rate cuts. The consultancy Capital Economics has forecast that inflation will fall below the central bank’s 2% target when figures for April are published on Wednesday and tumble to less than 1% before the end of the year. “This underpins our forecast that the Bank will cut interest rates from 5.25% now to 3% next year, rather than to 3.75% as investors expect,” the consultancy said. Other analysts expect inflation to bounce back above 3% before the end of the year as persistently high services inflation and wage increases in the financial and business services industry remain high, feeding into higher prices. Broadbent said: “There is a range of views across the committee on this point. In view of the rarity of events like this over the past, and the associated uncertainty about the future, that’s entirely understandable. “Whatever the priors of its individual members the MPC will continue to learn from the incoming data and, if things continue to evolve with its forecasts – forecasts that suggest policy will have to become less restrictive at some point – then it’s possible Bank rate could be cut sometime over the summer.” Earlier this month the MPC voted 7-2 to leave interest rates unchanged at their current 16-year high of 5.25%, with Broadbent one of seven members who opted for no change. The money markets currently indicate that there is a 57% chance that rates will be lowered to 5% at the Bank’s next meeting in June, while a cut by August is almost fully priced in. Michael Saunders, a former member of the MPC who left in 2022, said the Bank was likely to start cutting rates in the summer, and sooner than the US Federal Reserve. Saunders, who is now a senior economic adviser at Oxford Economics, said: “We expect the BoE’s monetary policy committee will cut rates soon, with a narrowly balanced choice between June and August for the first cut and rates falling by 75bps (basis points) by year end. This is a little earlier than our forecast for US easing, with a first cut expected in September and rates coming down by 50bps by year end.”",

        "title": "Green activists push Biden to freeze ‘disastrous’ deepwater oil export rigs",
        "content": "Joe Biden’s administration is coming under renewed pressure to escalate its curbs on the US’s booming trade in fossil fuels by halting new deepwater oil-export facilities, as well as entrenching its pause in gas-export licences. A coalition of 20 environmental groups, sensing election-year traction with Biden as he seeks a second term as US president, has written to officials demanding a freeze on deepwater oil-export facilities, similar to the move announced by the Biden administration earlier this year when it paused new licenses for liquified natural gas (or LNG) exports. A letter to the US Department of Transportation asks for a re-evaluation of whether the crude oil exports are in the national interest, given they cause “disastrous climate-disrupting pollution and environmental injustices and would lock in decades of fossil fuel dependence that undercut the pathway to a clean energy economy”. This week, activists are also set to press the Biden administration to indefinitely extend its pause on new LNG export licenses, citing the industry’s huge emissions and impacts upon communities and fishers along the Gulf of Mexico coast, even though the administration has indicated the pause will end within a year. Meanwhile, a further 200 groups have called for congressional leaders to end all funding that supports fossil fuel extraction across federal lands and waters, citing the need to rapidly phase out oil, gas and coal production to avoid disastrous climate change. “Congress has coddled the fossil fuel industry for decades, scarring millions of acres of public lands in the process,” said Ashley Nunes, public lands policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s past time our leaders take this simple step and stop funding activities that are completely at odds with protecting our climate.” Green groups are attempting to nudge Biden away from a conflicting dynamic in which the president has passed landmark climate legislation, and acted to slash emissions from cars, trucks and power plants, and yet has presided over an unprecedented glut in oil and gas drilling and industry profits. Last year, the US produced more oil and gas than any country has ever done in history. A particular target is the growth of deepwater facilities in the Gulf of Mexico that export crude oil. Last month, to the fury of campaigners, the Biden administration approved a license for the Sea Port 0il terminal, a platform located 30 miles (48km) off the coast of Texas that will convey up to 2m barrels of oil each day once completed. Three other such terminals are currently being considered, with proponents arguing they will create jobs and economic activity. The Sea Port oil terminal provides “a more environmentally friendly, safe, efficient and cost-effective way to deliver crude oil to global markets”, according to Jim Teague, co-chief executive of Enterprise, the operator of the project. Opponents point out that no new oil project can go ahead if the world is to meet climate goals the US has signed up to. The new infrastructure, meanwhile, will further burden Gulf communities that already have to live alongside a maelstrom of air and water pollution from a growing tangle of industry terminals and pipelines. “We think that building massive terminals to export fossil fuels, and putting them where people are already living with terribly polluted air, violates the policies that President Biden laid out in his executive orders,” said Sam Sankar, senior vice-president for programs at Earthjustice. The push for the deepwater export facilities comes amid a new push by oil companies to access resources located several miles underwater in the Gulf’s seabed. BP, which was responsible for the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, is reigniting its ambitions for deepwater oil drilling, insisting that safety is a major priority for the company. Sankar, who was deputy chief counsel for a Barack Obama-era commission into the disaster, said that major concerns over the practice remain. “Anyone on the spill commission would agree the fundamentals of the regulatory system have not changed,” he said. “Taxpayers and the ecosystems of the Gulf continue to bear the risks, and the risks remain enormous. That paradigm just hasn’t changed since then.” Asked about a potential pause in oil exports, a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation said it “has and will continue to take action that accelerates America’s transition to a clean energy future, benefitting communities, workers and our economy”. Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, said that “arbitrarily limiting the ability of the US to export energy would be incredibly damaging, not just for the US and Gulf coast, but also for our allies who depend on this stable and affordable global energy source”. Donald Trump, who is set to face Biden in November’s presidential election, has vowed to repeal various environmental regulations around drilling, allegedly in return for campaign contributions from the oil industry. While president, Trump wound back some of the safety rules that were put in place following the Deepwater Horizon disaster.",

        "title": "British Land sells stake in Sheffield’s Meadowhall shopping centre for £360m",
        "content": "The property developer British Land has sold its 50% stake in the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield to Norway’s sovereign wealth fund in a £360m deal, ending its holding in the site after 25 years. Norges Bank Investment Management will take full control of the shopping centre, the largest in Yorkshire. It already owned 50%, having first invested in 2012. Meadowhall opened in 1990 on the site of the former East Hecla steelworks, serving as a symbol of the UK’s shift from heavy industry to a services-based economy. At the time of opening it was the second largest shopping centre in the UK, according to a council history, and was built at a time when demand for shopping destinations appeared insatiable. Visitor numbers grew from 20 million in its first year to 30 million by 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic. However, shopping centres have come under pressure in recent years as sales have migrated online. The deal values Meadowhall at £734m, well below the £1.07bn the FTSE 250-listed British Land paid in 1999 to buy the centre from the original developers, Eddie Healey and Paul Sykes, or the £1.4bn valuation when Norges Bank bought the 50% stake in 2012. By 2019 Meadowhall had 290 stores plus 50 restaurants across 139,355 sq metres (1.5m sq ft) of retail space next to the M1 motorway. However, the pandemic starkly highlighted the pressures on the sector. British Land wrote down the value of its shopping centre portfolio in 2020 as lockdowns caused rents to drop. The company has since shifted focus away from shopping centres towards out-of-town retail parks that focus more on fewer, larger retailers, warehouses to cater for online deliveries and “campuses” – developments that mix offices and retail such as Broadgate and Paddington Central in London. Meadowhall sits beside the River Don and made headlines in 2019 when it provided overnight shelter for stranded shoppers cut off by floods. Simon Carter, the chief executive of British Land, said: “Following the sale of Meadowhall, 93% of our portfolio is now in our preferred segments of retail parks, campuses and London urban logistics. We will continue to grow our retail park portfolio; with low [capital expenditure] requirements parks offer attractive cash returns and at 99% occupancy we are delivering strong rental growth.” British Land will remain as the manager of Meadowhall, receiving fees for running it. The Times in January reported that retail mogul Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group had expressed an interest in buying British Land’s stake.",

        "title": "London-listed Keywords Studios says it will accept £2bn offer",
        "content": "The video game services company Keywords Studios has said it would be willing to accept a £2bn buyout offer, in the latest foreign takeover of a London-listed business. Shares in the Dublin-headquartered Keywords jumped 62% on Monday morning after it said it would be minded to recommend an offer from the Swedish private equity investor EQT Group. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market (Aim). It has grown to become one of the biggest businesses on the junior market by providing services to the developers of some of the world’s biggest games, including Fortnite, Clash of Clans, League of Legends and Assassin’s Creed. A takeover would add to the growing list of companies leaving the London Stock Exchange, amid concerns in the City of London over whether UK companies are undervalued. The retailer Hotel Chocolat and the asset manager Gresham House are two of the most recent Aim-listed companies that have been bought out. EQT has offered £25.50 a share for Keywords, 70% above its closing price of £14.70 on Friday, although well below its peak during the pandemic tech bubble of more than £33. Shares were trading at £23.78 after rising on Monday. The offer, if confirmed, would value Keywords at more than £2bn. EQT has until 15 June to make a firm offer or walk away. Keywords revealed that there had been a protracted courtship, with four unsolicited offers rejected. The company said the latest offer was “a significant increase from the initial proposal”, although it did not say what the first offer was. The business was founded in 1998 to help business software developers translate their products for release in other countries. In the early 2000s, it shifted focus towards games, and has since ridden the huge expansion in the size of the global industry, which far exceeds other entertainment sectors such as Hollywood or the music industry. It listed its shares in 2014. Keywords said it was “confident in the company’s growth strategy of building the only truly global platform providing solutions to the video games and entertainment industries, both organically and through acquisitions, and EQT is supportive of this strategy”. Katie Cousins, an analyst at Shore Capital Markets, an investment bank, said Keywords’s share price had dropped as tech valuations “normalised” from the excesses of the pandemic era, and as investors fretted about the possibility of artificial intelligence threats to its business model. However, she added that the company has a “leading status” in its field, with big-name clients and services that should benefit as the industry grows. Those services include producing games in whole or in part for other developers, producing voice and sound effects for games, translating games into different languages, and porting games between different platforms such as Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation.",

        "title": "Ryanair reports record €1.9bn profit as Amber Rudd joins board",
        "content": "Ryanair has reported record annual profits of €1.9bn (£1.6bn) as the Irish airline announced the appointment of former UK home secretary Amber Rudd to its board and said summer fares would be lower than previously expected. Profits after tax increased by more than a third in the year to the end of March compared with the previous year as the number of passengers increased by 9% to 184 million – 23% above the heights reached before the pandemic. The Dublin-listed company said it expected to carry as many as 200million passengers in the current financial year, but added that the prices it could charge were lower than expected in recent weeks. Ryanair said it expected prices to be “flat to modestly ahead of last summer”, but that “recent pricing is softer than we expected”, pushing it to offer lower fares to attract customers. Rudd was energy and climate change secretary under David Cameron and then home secretary for nearly two years under Theresa May, before resigning in 2018 in relation to the scandal over the mistreatment of the Windrush generation of migrants to the UK. She did not seek re-election in 2019. Rudd, who was an investment banker before becoming an MP, has since worked for public relations companies, as an adviser to Darktrace, a cyber-security company that is being bought by a US private equity investor, and on the board of the British Gas owner, Centrica. She joins Ryanair as a non-executive director on 1 July. Ryanair’s ever-increasing passenger numbers have made it the world’s second-largest airline by market value, but also one of the EU’s biggest polluters. The airline argues that its purchase of new aircraft will help it to improve its fuel efficiency. That could reduce carbon emissions for each passenger, although the total emissions of the airline industry are expected to increase roughly in line with passenger numbers. Ryanair’s efforts to increase passenger numbers, and to cut its fuel use for each passenger, have been hampered in recent years by the travails of the US plane manufacturer Boeing. The airline said it expected to take delivery of 12 new Boeing 737 Max aircraft between March and July, but said it would be 23 short of the contract with the manufacturer after repeated scandals over safety that have caused delays in deliveries. Michael O’Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, said: “We plan to deliver as much growth as possible for passengers and airport partners in [summer 2024], although these delays mean more traffic growth will occur in lower yielding [second half] than planned.”",

        "title": "Sales of bao buns on a roll as Britons fall in love with Asian treat",
        "content": "The origin of bao buns, or baozi, goes back as far as third-century China. The legend goes that a military strategist used the wheat buns instead of human heads as a peace offering to a god for safe passage. The deity fell in love with the steamed buns so much that he parted the rough waters of the river to allow crossing. It seems Britons have also fallen for the Asian treat. The English Breakfast Society, devoted to promoting the traditional English breakfast, this month encouraged the introduction of bao buns as part of a morning fry-up. A range of restaurants including the Wetherspoon’s pub chain, have experimented with them on their menus. Brunches and traditional burger places are swapping out bread for bao. Supermarkets are also reporting a huge boost in sales, and experts say the trend is driven by increasing interest in world cuisine. The fluffy white buns have experienced year-on-year growth, driven by a “shift towards embracing diverse cuisines”, according to Trish Caddy, associate director of food service at analysts Mintel. “This trend began as early as November 2013, with growing consumer interest in ethnic street food. Bao buns are a prime example. Back then, 14% of restaurant consumers had already tried baozi or bao. This trend continues to grow, with new takes on bao-like bao bun burgers emerging, highlighting a consumer appetite for more adventurous options beyond the familiar.” Caddy said that in May 2022, 21% of fast food consumers expressed interest in alternatives to standard burger buns, with steamed bao buns being one of the main options. “This interest continues to gain traction, with 44% of burger consumers indicating in June 2023 that they would be likely to order bao bun burgers,” she said. Tesco now sells 10 different varieties of branded and own-label bao buns including frozen, savoury and sweet versions. Marks &amp; Spencer sells about 475,000 bao buns a year and said its Panda bun sales were up 25% so far this year compared with last. Sainsbury’s first launched bao buns in 2017 to its “on the go” range, which was the first of its kind for a UK supermarket. Barbara Ross, the product development manager at the supermarket chain, said: “Bao buns have proven popular with Sainsbury’s customers, so much so that we included them in our recent party food range for Christmas in 2023. We even sold out before Christmas Eve.” Ocado said sales of bao buns had increased 45.15% year on year between May 2022 to April 2023 and May 2023 to 2024. Searches for the product on its website rose by 13.72% year on year in the same time period. In 2024, it increased its range by 50%. Allison Burdett, trading manager at Waitrose, said: “Our steamed buns have been a hit ever since we launched them last year … and with searches on Waitrose.com up 180% in the last week alone we know that they remain a firm favourite.” Aldi first stocked bao buns in 2023 as a limited range over the summer. Due to their popularity, the supermarket launched mini bao buns as part of its Christmas party food range and they are now sold all year round with volumes quadrupling. Aldi has plans to launch a range of new bao buns later this year. Its managing director of buying, Julie Ashfield, said: “World foods are becoming more popular. What used to be a fairly narrow selection of cuisines, like curries and noodles, has expanded … The cost of living crisis has also seen people eating out less often, but they still want to experiment with food at home.” Wetherspoon’s trialled them on some of its menus in February, although they are no longer available. The pub chain introduced bao buns as part of its affordable Small Plates range, described as “traditional Asian steamed buns with spicy crunchy chicken”, but the Daily Mail reported that it was criticised online for its “depressing portions”, including one slice of onion. Steve Mangleshot, global executive chef at the restaurant giant Wagamama, said it had served bao buns for a decade, with increased growth in the past five years. “The volume of buns sold each month has increased by 133%. The thing we love about bao is they’re the perfect blank canvas for bold flavour and texture.” All this combined, Caddy said, meant that restaurants and supermarkets were catering to the growing demand for accessible street food. She added: “Bao buns are well on track to becoming a mainstream menu item in the UK.”",

        "title": "Sir Tony O’Reilly obituary",
        "content": "As Ireland’s best known and most flamboyant businessman, Sir Tony O’Reilly, who has died aged 88, was instrumental in changing the image of his country from that of a commercial backwater into one of a booming “Celtic Tiger” economy. Never notably self-effacing, he once said: “The Irish in many countries concealed their identities. I got the Irish to be rather proud of the Irish.” But the career of the titan who had once been Ireland’s richest man and a sporting hero ended in failure when, in a demonstration of hubristic over-reach, he was pursued through the courts for debts which, in spite of the sale of his houses and art collection, he was unable to pay, and he was declared bankrupt in 2015. His achievements, in business, as first non-family chairman of Heinz, and in promoting Irish culture and working for peace in Ireland, were undeniable. His business contemporaries acknowledged him as one of the creators of modern Ireland. His ventures included a media empire that dominated the Irish press and for some years controlled the Independent newspaper in the UK, and oil and gas interests, as well as the Waterford Wedgwood china and glass company into which he and his brother-in-law were estimated to have sunk £400m before it went into receivership in 2009. Their losses sucked him dry and his fortune unravelled as the banks demanded repayment of his borrowings. His earlier career as a rugby player encompassed 29 caps for Ireland; a record, still-standing, for the most tries (37) by a British Lion; and a final summons to play for Ireland at the age of 33, delivered at 2am in Annabel’s nightclub in central London. It was the stuff of a Boy’s Own story. O’Reilly was born in Dublin, the son of a civil servant, Jack O’Reilly, who became inspector general of customs. The fact that Jack was not married to Tony’s mother, Aileen O’Connor (he had left his wife, Judith, and four children, but was not divorced), was only revealed to Tony by a schoolteacher, and he kept the knowledge secret for years afterwards. His parents married after the death of Jack’s first wife. Educated at Belvedere college, a private Catholic school in Dublin, O’Reilly studied law at University College Dublin, qualifying first and third in Ireland in the two parts of his final professional exams. But it was sport that marked him out; he was the redheaded pin-up boy of Irish rugby. A powerful three-quarter, first capped at 18, he was immediately picked for the British Lions (now the British &amp; Irish Lions) in 1955 and played in all four tests against South Africa. The following year he scored four tries for Ireland against both France and Scotland. In 1958 he went to work in England as a management consultant before moving back to Cork to an agricultural products business. In 1962, as general manager of the Irish Dairy Board, the charismatic O’Reilly demonstrated his marketing skills with the launch of Kerrygold butter; a huge success, particularly, as he himself conceded, since precious little butter was made in County Kerry. His brand focus remained constant, although his detractors claimed his most successful brand was himself. His next move to the Irish Sugar Board brought him to the notice of the American Heinz company. They made him their UK managing director and in 1971 moved him to the US headquarters in Pittsburgh, where he became the company’s president in 1973, chief executive in 1979 and the first non-Heinz family chairman in 1987. It was a rare success for a non-American, and drew both on his business achievement and charm. His leadership of Heinz lasted for 20 years, during which time its value multiplied 12 times. But sales fell in the early 1990s. In 1994 he took a cut to what was one of the most generous salaries in the US, amid accusations that his multifarious interests were taking his eye off the ball and doubts about his corporate governance. Although the company was then restructured and stabilised, O’Reilly regularly featured among BusinessWeek’s top five chief executives giving shareholders worst value for their salaries. Commentators pointed to the deal that allowed him to pursue his personal business interests in Ireland while employed by Heinz. Starting with Irish politicians such as Jack Lynch, and moving on from the Heinz family, he revelled in a huge circle of powerful friends in business, politics and show business, although some detected beneath his ebullient drive a desire to be liked that reflected an underlying insecurity. Many of his famous friends would join his boards and charities, and this sometimes drew accusations of cronyism. His directorships included Mobil, Bankers Trust and the Washington Post. He was heavily involved in the Republican party and was even considered as a possible secretary of commerce under George Bush Sr. But O’Reilly judged he would never leave a great mark on American life and refocused his interests in Ireland, where he had bought into a series of enterprises before leaving for Pittsburgh. In 1973, he had put more than £1m into the Irish Independent newspaper company, becoming executive chairman of Independent News and Media (INM) in 2000 with a controlling stake. He built up a dominant position in the Irish press, with stakes in nine of the 12 leading titles, before his investments in the rival Irish Press Group were labelled “abuse of a dominant position” by the Irish Competition Authority in 1995. He enjoyed the influence. Venturing into oil exploration, he told Forbes magazine: “I have close contact with the politicians. I got the [exploration] blocks I wanted”. O’Reilly internationalised his ambitions, buying into newspapers and broadcasting in South Africa (where he courted Nelson Mandela), Australasia and the UK. In Britain he bought shares in the loss-making Independent in 1994, describing it as his “calling card”. INM built up more than 200 newspaper and magazine titles and 130 broadcasting outlets. An international advisory board that included the actor Sean Connery, former rugby stars and North American and UK politicians gathered at top locations twice a year. But when the share price collapsed to a few cents in 2009, O’Reilly found himself under bitter attack from a rival Irish billionaire, Denis O’Brien, who, after objecting to the group’s coverage of his business, had built up a stake in INM almost equivalent to O’Reilly’s. He demanded sales of assets, including the Independent newspaper. In 2009 O’Reilly stepped down in favour of Gavin, the international advisory board disappeared, and O’Brien nominees were included on a smaller main board, replacing some O’Reilly family members. Assets were sold and in 2010 the Independent was purchased by the Russian businessman Alexander Lebedev. O’Reilly was also hurt by the failure of Waterford Wedgwood in 2009, which cost him his billionaire status. He saw his purchase of the old-established company, Ireland’s biggest private employer, in 1993, as the start of a conglomerate of famous brands. He was widely praised for supporting Irish traditional industry, and poured in huge sums of money before its ultimate failure. Other ventures had mixed success. His industrial holding company Fitzwilton, established with friends in 1970, started as a stockmarket favourite, and was intended to emulate Hanson. But it was only saved by a fire-sale of its investments in the mid-70s, just as O’Reilly was taking up the reins at Heinz. It was later taken private. In 2005 he made millions from the consortium that bought and re-sold Eircom, the former state telecommunications company, but his Irish oil exploration was a failure, in which shareholders lost millions and O’Reilly most of all. He was stung by criticism that he had abandoned Ireland for the US. “Cut him and he bleeds green,” said one business associate. He himself said: “Every time I achieve something or fail to achieve something, I feel the weight of being a representative of the hopes and aspirations and dreams of Irish round the world.” In the US in the 70s, he established and energetically promoted the Ireland Funds, specifically to foster “peaceful and fruitful coexistence in which both nationalist and unionist identities are mutually respected”. Conceived as a counterbalance to Noraid, which raised money for the IRA, it brought together leading Catholic and Protestant Irish-Americans and has raised more than $500m for community projects. In the 2001 New Year’s Honours list, O’Reilly received a British knighthood for his work for peace in Ireland. Famously described by Henry Kissinger as “a modern renaissance man”, O’Reilly contributed generously to the arts and academia from his own pocket, as well as through the O’Reilly Foundation, with major donations to Irish universities, including the O’Reilly Hall at University College Dublin; the O’Reilly Institute at Trinity College Dublin; and a new library for Queen’s University Belfast. Other sponsorships included the O’Reilly theatre in Pittsburgh. His social life was energetic, and he had homes in the Bahamas, France, the US, Dublin and various parts of Ireland, including a classical mansion, Castlemartin in County Kildare, where he entertained guests including Kissinger and the Hollywood actor Paul Newman. But in later years the fortune of an increasingly reclusive O’Reilly drained away. Although he had once been worth nearly £1bn, the collapse of the Irish banks revealed just how overstretched he had become. As they pressed for repayments, he had to use the proceeds of his holding in the smart meter company Landis and Gyr to halve his €70m debt to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (the IBRC, which in 2011 took over the bankrupt Anglo-Irish Bank). Then in 2014, AIB (the Allied Irish Banks) successfully sued him for €22m. He sold his Irish estates, including his beloved Castlemartin, “with 750 acres of the finest stud land in Ireland”, and made other disposals. A year later, the bank was still pursuing him for €14.3m and the court was told that O’Reilly was bedridden in New York after a back operation. His bankruptcy was declared in the Bahamas, where he had residence, in 2015 and he was finally released from it in January this year on the basis that the whole of his property had been released for the benefit of his creditors. Insult had been added to injury when Sabina Vidunas, whom he had employed as his personal assistant and nurse for 15 years, sued him for refusing to honour promises to provide her with shares supposedly put into trust for her. It was a sad postscript to a remarkable life during which O’Reilly made a major contribution to a modern Ireland whose emergence he seemed to symbolise. In 1962 he married Susan Cameron, an Australian pianist he had met on a Lions tour, and they had three sons and three daughters, including triplets. After their divorce, in 1991 he married Chryss Goulandris, of the Greek shipping family, with a fortune that exceeded his own, and a shared interest in the turf which included her own horse-breeding stables. She died last year. O’Reilly is survived by his children. • Anthony Joseph Francis O’Reilly, businessman, born 7 May 1936; died 18 May 2024",

        "title": "Hundreds of Virgin Atlantic cabin crew sue for unfair dismissal",
        "content": "Hundreds of long-serving Virgin Atlantic cabin crew are suing the airline for unfair dismissal, claiming that the airline used Covid redundancies to target older staff. An employment tribunal in London will start examining more than 200 cases next month, at which former crew will argue that Sir Richard Branson’s airline unfairly made them redundant while retaining cheaper new hires. Virgin grounded most of its fleet, alongside most other airlines, from March 2020, when the Covid pandemic led to lockdowns and global travel restrictions. The airline quickly cut 3,000 jobs, eventually losing more than 40% of its 10,000-strong workforce, and established a “holding pool” for staff who were made redundant to be potentially hired again when flights resumed. However, according to one claim, disclosure documents show that Virgin retained 350 new cabin crew via the pool, some with as little as one week’s training, while onboard managers, who were 45 on average with 20 years’ experience, were made redundant. One of the onboard managers who lost her job was Susan Mcentegart, now 53, who had worked for Virgin for 23 years. She is part of a group of 51 claimants being represented by a Luton-based law firm. She said: “It seemed the world was closing down and losing jobs was inevitable. But the way they went about it seemed unfair. But I was flabbergasted that I wasn’t in the holding pool. “There were people who hadn’t even got their wings – after six weeks of training – in the pool, and there seemed to be too many of us of an age that were left out.” Mcentegart added: “It was a devastating loss … It felt like my identity was gone, and I was in a dark place with how they went about it. I’d felt it was an honour to work for Virgin, and I couldn’t believe they’d done what they’d done.” Another 150 former staff are pursuing claims via the Cabin Crew Union, and 11 are represented elsewhere. A spokesperson for the airline said: “Following the severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the aviation industry, Virgin Atlantic had to make very difficult decisions. Sadly, this included reducing the number of people employed across the business by 45%. “Our people are incredibly important to us, from those who have been with us since 1984, to our newest recruits. Throughout the redundancy process, we were committed to ensuring all our people were treated fairly and compassionately. “To allow as many of our people to return as soon as demand allowed, we introduced a holding pool, which meant that more than 1,000 of our cabin crew returned at their previous level of seniority. “Where people had to unfortunately leave us, it was for unbiased, objective and lawful reasons, after full consultation with our recognised unions, elected colleague representatives and clear and open continued communication.” The airline had warned that it was on the brink of collapse before Branson and other shareholders secured a £1.2bn rescue plan in late 2020 to keep it going until international travel resumed. In an interview with the Guardian in 2022, the airline’s chief executive, Shai Weiss, said the company had needed to make cuts before the pandemic, after years of borderline profit and loss. Virgin had needed to use “a crisis as an opportunity”, asking itself, he said: “Can we be more brutally focused, can we go even further?”",

        "title": "Tata agrees Port Talbot deal with National Grid despite union criticism",
        "content": "Tata Steel has reached a deal with the UK’s electricity grid to start supplying the energy for new furnaces in south Wales from 2027, as the company moves ahead with its plan despite union opposition. The agreement with the National Grid’s electricity supply operator (ESO), the company that controls how energy is moved around Great Britain, will provide hundreds of megawatts of power to a new electric arc furnace at the steelworks in Port Talbot. Tata Steel is planning to shift rapidly from two polluting blast furnaces – which can produce 5m tonnes of steel, but also nearly 2% of UK carbon emissions – to electric technology that can produce up to 3.2m tonnes of recycled steel a year. The plan will cut emissions dramatically, but it will also mean as many as 2,800 steelworkers will lose their jobs, in a devastating blow to a community built around the works. The first blast furnace is due to close at the end of June, followed by the second blast furnace and the “heavy end”, which makes steel from iron, in September. Tata Steel is expected to open a voluntary redundancy scheme as early as next week, after initially planning to do so this week. Tata Steel has been in talks with ESO since 2020, as it considered options to decarbonise. Upgrades to grid connections, and particularly linking the “generation-rich” north to the “demand-rich” south of the UK, are increasingly important, said Marc Hedin, the head of research for UK and Ireland, at Aurora Energy Research. Hedin said he did not believe that any other projects would have been pushed back to make way for the Tata Steel connection, and existing infrastructure would limit the cost to the grid. Nevertheless, the agreement signals that Tata is pushing forward on an ambitious timescale for the switch. It hopes to make an order for the furnace equipment by September, and to start construction by August 2025. Unions have argued that Tata could avoid making thousands of redundancies by keeping one blast furnace open until 2032 while also building the electric arc furnace. However, Tata has rejected that plan, arguing that it was financially unsustainable, and is starting consultations with workers about redundancies. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, a national officer at GMB union, said: “Tata Steel seems to be quite happy moving on and agreeing deals with the National Grid. But the thousands of steelworkers whose lives they’ve ruined would like them to put a bit more time into agreeing their redundancy terms – or even an approach to decarbonisation that doesn’t result in compulsory redundancies.” Port Talbot steelworkers represented by the Community union last week voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action, as have Unite members. GMB has been forced to rerun its ballot to meet legal requirements. Tata Steel has claimed that workers will receive worse redundancy terms if they proceed with industrial action. The government indicated that it worked to speed up the connection, after backing Tata’s plan with a pledge of £500m in financial support. In a statement provided by Tata Steel, the investment security minister Alan Mak, said: “Accelerating grid connection timescales is a top priority for government and we are working closely with Ofgem and the network companies to transform the electricity network at a scale and pace not seen for decades.” Rajesh Nair, the chief executive of Tata Steel UK, said the grid connection was a “critical milestone in transforming our steelmaking operations in Port Talbot”. “Having access to higher-power electricity is a foundation stone for greener steelmaking, regardless of the technology choice,” he said. “This agreement means we will have sufficient power for our new electric arc furnace and the capability in the longer-term to further strengthen our business.”",

        "content": "The global economy is fragmenting and a new era of protectionism has dawned. Dreams by free marketeers of a frictionless world in which goods and services moved seamlessly from country to country are dead. That was the clear message from Joe Biden’s decision last week to target China with a range of new, much higher tariffs on electric vehicles and a range of other products crucial to sectors seen by the White House as vital to the future health of the US economy and to national security. It was also the message from Vladimir Putin’s visit to Beijing, where he received a show of support from Xi Jinping for Russia’s military action against Ukraine, which has intensified in recent weeks. There is a new cold war and it is hotting up. In themselves, Biden’s new tariffs won’t have much economic impact, because China exports very little steel and aluminium, and few EVs, silicon chips and solar panels to the US anyway. But as the consultancy Capital Economics has pointed out, that’s because of previously announced measures introduced by Donald Trump and the fear that protectionism will be ratcheted up in the future. Republicans and Democrats both support a hawkish approach to China. The trade tension is unlikely to ease soon. Biden has made support for the green technology sector central to his plan to rebuild the US manufacturing base. The president is not prepared to see his industrial strategy undermined by a flood of cheap, and heavily subsidised, Chinese imports. Tougher protectionist measures from the US come amid signs that Beijing has abandoned, at least for now,attempts to rebalance its growth model away from exports and towards domestic consumption. China remains a high-saving, high-investment, low-consumption economy and that inevitably means that the surplus goods churned out by its factories find their way into global markets. As China’s trade surplus grows ever bigger, protectionist sentiment in the US will become more pronounced. This is not quite what the US and its developed-country allies envisaged when China was admitted into the World Trade Organization in 2001. Back then the feeling was that if China could make manufactured goods more cheaply than domestic producers, then that meant higher profits for western multinationals and lower prices for western consumers. There are far fewer advocates for this pure free-trade approach in Washington and Brussels today, even though the availability of cheap Chinese EVs in the US and Europe would help meet net zero goals. In the short term, the focus will be on whether China will retaliate to Biden’s tariffs with protectionist measures of its own. Beijing has thus far seemed unwilling to get involved in a tit-for-tat trade war, but will be forced to do so if Trump wins the presidency in November and makes good on his pledge to slap a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods. For now, a full-blown trade war looks unlikely but it can’t be ruled out. Seen from one perspective, Washington’s attempts to protect its green technology sector can be seen as evidence that the US is fighting an economic war with China that it is doomed to lose. China is growing at double the rate of the US, runs a thumping trade surplus and has cornered the market in solar panels and other green-tech products. This, though, ignores some deep structural weaknesses in the Chinese economy, not least a worrying demographic trend that will see its working-age population shrink from one billion to 400 million by the end of the century. Erik Britton, the managing director of the Fathom Consultancy, says it has been apparent for at least a decade that China’s growth rate is slowing and the period of rapid catch-up with the US is over, at least for now. There is, as Britton points out, a strong correlation between economic freedom and living standards as measured by gross domestic product per head of population. Most of the countries with per-capita incomes of more than 50% of US levels are democracies, with oil producers being the exception. China is seeking to become a high per-capita income country while remaining a totalitarian state. That’s not all. If there is further fracturing of the global economy into rival blocs then China is in a weaker position than the US. A US-led bloc is likely to be composed of many more – and richer – countries than a China-led bloc, despite attempts by Beijing to extend its influence overseas through the belt and road initiative. The thinking behind the tough stance being adopted by the US goes as follows. First, it was a mistake to assume that China would become more liberal once it was plugged into the global economy. Second, allowing China’s rapid industrial growth has hollowed out manufacturing in the US. Third, China’s model does not lend itself to free thinking and innovation, but instead relies on intellectual property being imported, often through unfair means, from the west. Fourth, it makes sense to make it as hard as possible for China to acquire this knowhow. Fifth, China’s aggressive use of industrial policy needs to be matched by the US. If that all means the US becoming more interventionist and more protectionist, then so be it. In these circumstances, interventionism is justified and protectionism is good. Biden thinks parts of the US economy are too strategically important to allow them to fall into Chinese hands and he is right about that. He also thinks the US needs to build up its own industrial strength and he is right about that too. Other countries are watching closely, as well they might. There are clear lessons here for other western countries, including – and most especially – the UK.",

        "title": "Inflation in the UK is about to tumble. But how far – and for how long?",
        "content": "Jeremy Hunt knows it. Rachel Reeves knows it too. The Office for National Statistics will come bearing good news on Wednesday when it releases the latest inflation figures. The only real question is just how good the news will be. In the year to March, annual inflation as measured by the consumer prices index stood at 3.2%. The figure for April will be a lot lower and if Hunt gets lucky it might even fall as low as the government’s 2% target. The sharp decline is mainly due to movements in electricity and gas prices. Domestic energy bills rose in April 2023 but have fallen by 12% this year for most households. The energy price cap was set at £1,690 last month compared with £2,500 a year earlier. Base effects – in other words, what happened a year ago – coupled with cheaper heating and lighting this year means it is inevitable the inflation rate will tumble. Hunt is a seasoned enough politician to avoid claiming total victory when the figures come out. The chancellor is aware that voters have seen prices rise by 20% in less than three years and may be unwilling to accept that the cost of living crisis is over. And this is not “game over” by any means. The Bank of England expects less favourable base effects later this year to push the annual inflation rate back up to about 2.5% in the second half of 2024 – the period when the prime minister seems likely to call a general election. But even with the additional caveat that prices are not actually falling but simply rising at a slower rate, the position is a lot more comfortable than it was for Hunt when he was appointed by Liz Truss to succeed Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor in October 2022. In that month, inflation hit 11.1% – its highest level in four decades. Double-digit inflation conjured up unhappy memories of the mid-1970s, when inflation soared to a postwar high of more than 25% and eventually led to the need for a bailout from the International Monetary Fund – assistance that came with strings attached. By coincidence, an IMF team has been in the UK for the past two weeks conducting its annual health check on the economy. Unlike in 1976, the fund will not be demanding unpopular spending cuts, and the findings of this so-called article IV consultation will prove helpful to Hunt if it finds that the UK is through the worst of the cost of living crisis. But the study may contain a sting in the tail if it also concludes that any further pre-election tax cuts will be followed by post-election tax increases or fresh austerity measures. In the short term, though, the focus will be on what lower inflation means for interest rates. Having raised the official cost of borrowing at 14 successive meetings of its monetary policy committee between December 2021 and August 2023, Threadneedle Street has left rates unchanged since. The reason for that is that a majority of MPC members want to be sure that inflation has truly been beaten. The focus is not the headline rate of inflation – which is influenced by the global prices of energy and food – but on inflation generated by the domestic economy. As a proxy for that, the MPC watches services-sector inflation, which is currently running at 6%. While the headline inflation number will be good on Wednesday, it will be the small print that really counts. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “If inflation hits the sweet spot, hopes will shoot higher that a rate cut will come in June. But it would be wise not to reach for the bunting and go splashing the celebratory cash even if the longed-for 2% target is reached. “Bank of England policymakers have stressed that it will need confidence that inflation will consistently stay at or near the target before they start reducing borrowing costs.”",

        "title": "Eurostar reverses wheelchair policy that left user stranded, after Observer campaign",
        "content": "Eurostar has reversed a new accessibility policy that left a wheelchair user stranded and has retrained its London staff following pressure from the Observer. Travellers with disabilities claimed that they would be barred from Eurostar services after the company banned its London staff from pushing passenger wheelchairs. Those who require assistance were told they must travel with a companion or cancel their ticket if they were unable to access services unaided, according to passengers who contacted the Observer. Student actor Cedric Alvarez was left stranded on arrival at London St Pancras after station staff told him they were no longer allowed to wheel his chair. He had requested special assistance for the journey from Paris and his booking confirmation stated that he would be pushed to and from the train at both stations. “Eventually, a couple of staff took pity on me and agreed to push me to the taxi rank provided they could take a photo of me to show their manager in case they got into trouble,” he said. He met the same problem on his return journey. “This was the first time I had travelled independently and I was so excited, only to be told by Eurostar that I should have taken a companion. I’d travelled to London to see a play, written and performed by disabled actors, which showed that disability need not be an obstacle to a successful career, but Eurostar thinks differently.” Eurostar employs specialist agencies that are licensed to provide passenger assistance on the continent but has brought the service in-house in London. It initially told the Observer that it is unable to train its staff to push passenger wheelchairs for health and safety reasons, but that travellers who need assistance can transfer into a station chair. It insisted that those who are unable to transfer can buy a reduced-price ticket for a travelling companion and apologised for the poor communication. The requirements were not mentioned in its special assistance booking confirmation or on its accessibility policy, which was only updated after the Observer reported it to the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road. Eurostar has now agreed to revoke the policy and train its staff after the Observer raised the plight of other passengers unable to travel because of the rules. One woman, who prefers not to be named, said she was told to cancel her booking because Eurostar refused to deploy a ramp for her partner, who has impaired mobility. “My partner is not in a wheelchair, but he can’t manage the steps up into the train,” she said. “We were told ramps can only be used for wheelchair users and that if he couldn’t manage the steps we could ask for a refund. This was to be his first trip abroad since he had a stroke 15 years ago, and he’d been looking forward to it for months.” Lynne Verrall, who has motor neurone disease, told the Observer that Eurostar’s policy would force her to fly rather than travel by train as she is unable to transfer herself to a station wheelchair. “They say they can’t train staff to push all types of wheelchairs but have they trained them to lift someone who is paralysed into one of their own?” she said. “The whole heartless exercise suggests that they think all wheelchair users are the same.” A spokesperson for Eurostar told the Observer: “The experience of these customers and your outreach has prompted us to take a very close look at accessibility, which is a top priority for Eurostar. Customers will now be assisted in their own wheelchairs provided they pass a visual safety check. To support this initiative, we have already trained over 60 staff members, and this training will be conducted every 12 months. “Our partners at the European Business and Service Centre are updating their information accordingly. Pre-travel communications will also be amended to explain the elements we will be checking.”",

        "title": "If Putin wins in Ukraine, the British economy will be in the firing line | Phillip Inman",
        "content": "Vladimir Putin is digging deep to win the war with Ukraine. And it could be only months before the tide turns in his favour. If he pummels Ukraine into submission, a military victory will quickly become a wider economic disaster, which is why we underestimate at our peril how much we need to focus on the war. The Russian leader, who was inaugurated for a fifth term as president a fortnight ago, ditched his old friend and defence minister Sergei Shoigu on Monday in favour of an economist to make sure Moscow’s war machine runs more efficiently. That economist, Andrei Belousov, has been likened to Albert Speer, the architect who served as the minister of armaments and war production in Nazi Germany. On Thursday, Putin visited China to reaffirm relations with his main trading partner and thank his counterpart, Xi Jinping, for facilitating shipments of tech and components essential for the war effort. These moves show Putin has become a leader who not only believes in war, in the sense that he believes in Moscow’s mythical project to recapture land that “rightly” belongs to Russia, but who also needs the war to stay in power. He can sense weakness in the opposition, now he has knocked out almost 40% of Ukraine’s electricity supply and knows Kyiv is running low on volunteers for the army. Alongside the military conflict, Putin is also waging an economic one aimed at destabilising EU nations and the UK for Russia’s benefit. Ukraine is rich in minerals and hosts vast farms that produce, among other things, 20% of the world’s wheat. Global food prices are low again after Ukrainian officials found ways to export by land and sea. However, once under Moscow’s control, basic commodities would again become a political weapon, sending prices rocketing, and undermining the legitimacy of democratic governments. More than Brexit, which we know Putin had a hand in fomenting, and more than the conflict in the Middle East, which Russia, and the Soviet Union before it, also fostered whenever they could, the war in Ukraine ranks alongside the climate crisis as an existential threat to Europe. The difference with climate change is that the next few months in the war are not just important, they are vital. Russia’s attack in the north, which threatens Kharkiv, is the first stage in a bid to break the deadlock across the eastern front. With China’s unofficial support and an economy that has gradually shifted over to the manufacture of military hardware and support services for the army, navy and air force, Putin is readying himself for a major offensive. With extra resources available to Putin, Britain itself could be targeted. Latest intelligence warns that Russian-backed ransomware attacks on UK businesses and public organisations could step up a gear. Last week, Anne Keast-Butler used her first major speech as boss of Britain’s signals intelligence operations to highlight the immediate danger posed by the Kremlin’s encouragement of partisan cyberwarriors, with warnings the conflict could move from the digital sphere to “physical surveillance and sabotage operations”. “Before, Russia simply created the right environments for these groups to operate but now they are nurturing and inspiring these non-state cyber actors and, in some cases, seemingly coordinating physical attacks against the west,” said Keast-Butler. Putin is not a pantomime villain. He is the real deal. The EU and Britain need to join the US in coming up with even more money for Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Handwringing by the UK Treasury and the European Commission is holding up attempts to confiscate $300bn of Russian central bank funds, mostly sitting in Belgium’s Euroclear exchange. EU officials are minded to take the interest generated by the funds but not all of the $300bn, despite legal advice that says the money can be sequestrated. Philippa Webb, a professor of international law at King’s College London and an adviser to the European parliament, says the confiscation of central bank assets is a breach of international law unless it can be considered a “countermeasure”. “International law provides that violations may be justified if the action is ‘taken in response to a previous internationally wrongful act of another state and … directed against that state’, so long as certain requirements are met,” she says. Among these conditions is that the measure has “the object of inducing compliance with an international obligation, it is proportionate, and is temporary and reversible”. The money could be used to rectify the estimated $486bn worth of damage inflicted on Ukraine by Putin, freeing up other funds for the military battles ahead. No one wants to think about war in Europe, but there is a war, like it or not, and someone will win. It had better not be Putin.",

        "title": "‘Bloody £9 for two’: TikTok twins rage at ice-cream van prices",
        "content": "Like the totemic £8 pint or £5 coffee, the cost of a Mr Whippy ice-cream has become a barometer of a world gone mad. But really, nine quid for two ice-creams? Bloody hell. That was the damning verdict of an eight-year-old whose TikTok rant over the cost of two screwballs from an ice cream van in the park has racked up 14m views at the time of writing. The clip featuring Burnley twins Marnie and Mylah channels the anger of Britons who, on a rare sunny day, and grappling with their own personal cost of living crisis, have felt stung by the cost of a round of cones when they finally got to the front of the queue. One of the twins, with a brutal take on ice-cream van economics, says a van that visits her street charges £1 or £2 so the unidentified business is “going to get nowhere”. To add insult to injury, she adds that the van “only does bloody cards” not cash. The viral clip has left many of the UK’s 5,000 “mobilers”, already laid low by the bad weather, despairing at the brutal takedown of an industry, with sales of about £1.45bn a year, still trapped in a cycle of rising costs. “Everything is going up,” said John Taylor, whose C&amp;M Ices van was crowned “mobiler of the year 2023” by industry trade association, the Ice Cream Alliance (ICA). “It’s not just our industry. Every industry is in the same boat. The problem is everybody perceives us as a cheap product.” “Everyone seems to think ice-cream should be 50p or a £1,” continued Taylor, who suggested such prices harked back to the 70s. “They’re quite happy to pay four quid for a lukewarm Starbucks coffee but won’t pay a couple of quid for a high-quality ice-cream.” Taylor reels off a long list of cost pressures bearing down on ice-cream vans including diesel, electricity, insurance, pitch fees and wages, with his own business experiencing double-digit price increases for several years in a row. Then there is the rocketing cost of ingredients such as milk powder and sugar. “We don’t have the power of the supermarkets to buy 1,000 pallets of Magnums and sell them on at next to nothing just to get people through the doors,” said the businessman, who sells ice-creams beside Victoria shopping centre in Harrogate. “We’re small, independent, family-run businesses most of the time.” There are also other forces turning on screwballs. They can no longer be sold in single-use plastic containers, with one van owner reporting the replacement costs eight times as much. But, still, is £4.50 a lot for a screwball? Taylor says it “does sound a bit steep for a basic ice-cream” but questions: “What is his or her rent in that park?” Joseph McNeil, the ICA president, said the price of a Mr Whippy varied depending upon where you live and was heavily influenced by pitch fees. However, he suggested that around the £3.50 mark is the average cost of a single cone with a flake. Charging £4.50 for a screwball is at the “top end” but “isn’t unreasonable”, said McNeil. “We, as an industry, probably come under fire more over price. This is the second or third video I’ve seen this year about ice-cream being expensive.” “No one seems to associate the cost of living crisis with the ice-cream man or woman. We are going through it the same as any other business. Our rents are forever increasing, we have VAT and the national living wage to pay, and that’s before we get started on ingredients to actually make the ice-cream.”",

        "content": "Employers can be found vicariously liable for alleged sexual assault that occurred between employees outside working hours but only where it was connected with their employment, according to a leading employment law expert. PwC is facing legal action claiming the accountancy firm is liable for the alleged rape of a graduate employee following after-work drinks. The graduate employee is suing PwC for damages over two alleged incidents of sexual assault by a colleague after work hours, court documents show. It includes one claim that the young woman was raped at her home after she went to pubs with colleagues following a meeting held at PwC’s office. A case management hearing was held in early April and the proceeding was referred for mediation. PwC is arguing it is not liable because the alleged incidents were not connected to her or the alleged perpetrator’s role as a worker at the firm, and the graduate did not directly work with the accused. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Josh Bornstein, an employment lawyer at Maurice Blackburn who was not involved in the case and was speaking generally, said the question for the courts in such cases was whether the conduct had a “connection with the employment” of the employee. “There have been a number of cases in recent decades that have established that employers are liable for sexual harassment and sexual assault including rape that has occurred outside working hours and outside the physical workplace,” he said. “The overwhelming majority of cases of this nature tend to resolve out of court.” The graduate continued to work for a month after the alleged incident, but has not returned to her job at the firm since last September due to the stress and anxiety arising from the assault, according to court documents. New South Wales police conducted an investigation into the claims after a report was made last year, but no charges have been laid. Court documents show PwC argued the incident was not connected to the graduate or manager’s role at the firm because it did not direct her or the manager to attend the pub, and had no capacity to supervise or issue directions. The firm argued it was also not vicariously liable for the alleged incident because PwC had taken “all reasonable steps” to prevent such behaviour. It pointed out that the alleged perpetrator completed two training modules in 2022 on workplace behaviour that covered preventing sexual harassment. Two months before the alleged incident, the firm says, the man completed another introductory training on preventing sexual harassment. “With respect to the workplace, [PwC] has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment in the workplace,” the firm’s lawyer wrote. “It has a robust suite of policies, bespoke compulsory training, and initiatives directed at addressing sexual harassment risks at work.” • Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

        "title": "Thames Water’s biggest investor cuts value of its stake to zero",
        "content": "Thames Water’s biggest investor has slashed the value of its stake in the company to zero in the latest sign of an escalating financial crisis for Britain’s biggest water supplier. The Canadian pension fund Omers issued a “full writedown” of its 31.7% stake in Thames’s troubled parent company in its annual report published on Friday, signalling that it believes its share is worth nothing. The latest blow to the water supplier, which serves about a quarter of the UK’s population, marks a precipitous decline for a company that Omers valued at £700m at the end of 2022 and £990m at the end of 2021. Omers signalled that Thames is now worthless a day after Michael McNicholas, a managing director at Omers Infrastructure, quit his role as non-executive director of Thames Water. The decision to raze the value of Thames has emerged weeks after Omers, and the company’s other shareholders, refused to give the company £500m of emergency funding after branding its business plan “uninvestable”. Alongside Omers, Thames shareholders include the British university staff pension scheme USS and the BT Pension Scheme manager Hermes. None have taken a dividend from Thames since they bought into the business in 2017. The water company is now racing to avoid a multibillion-pound taxpayer-backed bailout after its parent company, Kemble, defaulted on its debt, raising fears that the company could face a significant restructure or even collapse. Thames could be placed into special administration, which would result in the government stepping in and temporarily renationalising the company. This outcome would probably fuel critics of the Conservative government who argue the water company’s plight represents the failure of Margaret Thatcher’s privatisation agenda. The Guardian revealed last month that under radical plans being drawn up in Whitehall, codenamed Project Timber, ministers would turn Britain’s biggest water company into a publicly owned arm’s-length body. The plans, overseen by Defra and the Treasury, a new public corporation would be formed to hold the water monopoly, modelled on the company that built the £18.8bn Crossrail project, while Thames’s vast liabilities would be assumed into the government’s debt pile. The water regulator, Ofwat, is reportedly working on rescue plans for Thames that could lead to the water company’s regional monopoly being dismantled and sold off to neighbouring rival suppliers under a scheme codenamed Project Telford. Ofwat has tasked the former private equity banker Adrian Williams with overseeing the rescue bid, according to the Telegraph, in a last-ditch attempt to save the company from collapsing under the weight of a more than £15bn debt pile. Under the plan, Thames could be split into two smaller suppliers: one covering London and the other supplying water services to Thames Valley and Home Countries regions. The company may end up being split up into as many as “a dozen” smaller companies, according to the report. An Ofwat spokesperson said: “Safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected, regardless of issues faced by the shareholders.” The strain on Thames’s finances was laid bare last month in a revised plan submitted by the water company to Ofwat, which revealed that the annual interest bill on its borrowings is expected to rise to about £3bn by 2030. Thames was privatised in 1989 with no debt. In the decades since the water supplier has taken on more debt to help fund its infrastructure projects while paying large dividends to investors, most notably the Australian investment bank Macquarie. The government was approached for comment.",

        "title": "Train operator Lumo plans new direct service from Greater Manchester to London",
        "content": "Plans for an alternative direct train service between Greater Manchester and London have been launched, promising competitive fares, by the transport group that already runs the main Avanti service linking the cities. Trains straight from London Euston to Rochdale will run from 2027, if approved, under FirstGroup’s Lumo brand, calling first at Warrington and going via Manchester Victoria. Lumo, which operates a London-Edinburgh service, would run six return trains a day from the capital to Rochdale, restoring a direct London link lost in 2000. While the struggles of Avanti to fulfil its timetable in recent years might lead some passengers to welcome an alternative, the train is likely to take slightly longer to reach central Manchester, about two and a half hours. FirstGroup, which also runs the open-access operator Hull Trains, said Lumo would use new UK-built trains powered by electricity and batteries to help push more travellers from road to rail. It has submitted an application to the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, to launch a second route to Rochdale on an open-access basis – operating outside the government specified contracts on which most of the railway timetable is run. Although previous applications were fiercely opposed by the main operators on heavily used rail lines, FirstGroup-owned Avanti is less likely to object. Open access has been encouraged by Conservatives in the name of competition, but many in the industry believe that the taxpayer-funded railway loses out, in terms of revenue and in the efficiency of its overall timetable. The Network Rail chief executive, Andrew Haines, recently told the Guardian that “you have to be honest about the true costs of running it”. The Rochdale services would run on the congested West Coast main line and take about three hours to reach the town, with the train also stopping at Newton-le Willows and Eccles. The FirstGroup chief executive, Graham Sutherland, said: “We have extensive experience of running open access rail operations, and we want to bring our successful Lumo service to this new route that connects Rochdale and London. “We have seen the level of growth and opportunity that is possible with open access, as well as the positive effect it has on the wider market, including economic and environmental benefits.” However, the RMT union said open access operators were “not fronting up the true costs” and that Avanti owner FirstGroup was “one of the worst train operating companies we have ever dealt with” and should not be given additional rights. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch added: “Open access is part of a parasitic private model where operators do not pay the full costs of everything that is involved in running the service, and they are effectively cross subsidised by the taxpayer.” With the government planning measures to hasten new open access schemes, a number of proposed routes are in the pipeline, including a direct London-Wrexham rail service unveiled in March, as well as trains running from the capital straight to Stirling in Scotland and Carmarthen in Wales.",

        "title": "Company insolvencies jump; Royal Mail takeover would face security review; energy cap to fall in July – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up…. here’s today’s main news stories: A takeover bid for Britain’s Royal Mail would be subject to “normal” national security scrutiny, says chancellor Jeremy Hunt. The price cap on British energy bills are forecast to drop by over £100 per year this summer. And in the City, the stock market is shuffling towards the weekend with the FTSE 100 index down 10 points (-0.15%) at 8428 points. China will cut mortgage rates and allow local authorities to turn unsold homes from developers into affordable housing, in a series of drastic measures by Beijing aimed at propping up the country’s faltering property market. The People’s Bank of China said it would scrap the minimum rate of interest and reduce down-payment ratios to 15% for first-time buyers and 25% for second homes. It will also create a 300bn yuan (£32.8bn) facility to support local state-owned companies to buy homes at reasonable prices, it said in a series of statements on Friday. The announcement is China’s biggest effort yet to restore confidence in its ailing property market after data released on Friday showed month-on-month house prices were falling at the steepest rate in a decade despite previous efforts to curb losses. Hundreds of Border Force officers at Heathrow Airport are to launch fresh strikes over the half-term school holidays, in an ongoing dispute over a new staff roster. The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said more than 500 of its members will walk out on May 31, June 1 and 2. PCS says its members are committed to the action and expect that their walkouts will disrupt passport checks for travellers coming into the UK at Heathrow airport. Staff will also refuse to work overtime for three weeks from June 4. The officers, who work in terminals 2, 3, 4 and 5, took four days of action last month. PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote said: “We are keen to resolve this dispute but the Home Office must first put something on the table for our members to consider. “The Home Office has said it is ‘open to discuss’ a resolution but it only responded to our request for a meeting after we threatened further action. “Until it comes back with changes to the roster that will benefit our members then the dispute will continue.” The biggest shareholder in Thames Water has written off the entire value of its stake in the water company. A Singapore-registered subsidiary of Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, which holds a 31% stake in Thames Water, has revealed it will make “a full writedown of [its] investment and loan receivable with accrued interest”. Omers Farmoor Singapore Pte made the statement in accounts filed today. The stake had been valued at £990m at the end of December 2021, which was cut to £700m last year. The move is the latest sign of the utility’s desperate financial situation, reports Bloomberg, coming just weeks after its parent company told its creditors it has defaulted on its debts. In March Thames shareholders, including Omers, decided not to inject fresh equity into the business after discussions with regulator Ofwat, saying that the company was “uninvestable”. The government has drawn up contingency plans, known as Project Timber, in case it needs to renationalise Thames via a special administration. Dear oh dear. Electronics retailer GameStop has issued a profits warning, at the end of a turbulent week which saw its share price surge, then slump. GameStop told shareholders today it expects to make a net loss of $27m to $37m in the 13 weeks to 4 May, compared with a $50.5m loss in the previous three months. Net sales are expected to fall to between $872m and $892m, compared to $1.237bn in the previous quarter. Shares in GameStop are down 22% in premarket trading, at $21.66. GameStop’s stock surged at the start of this week, jumping 100% in early trading on both Monday and Tuesday (when it hit $60) as meme stock excitement returned. Asda has said that food price inflation has continued to ease in April and May. Food price rises are now in line with historic averages, Asda said, as it revealed underlying sales had risen just 1.4% in the first quarter of the year. Michael Gleeson, the supermarket’s new finance boss said total sales including new store openings, but excluding fuel, were up 6.6% to £5.3bn and this was “further evidence of the underlying strength of the Asda business.” However, he admitted that Asda, which has bought and converted hundreds of small convenience stores in the past year, had lost market share in recent months and the underlying sales growth was led by Asda’s George clothing and homewares business indicating that food sales continue to fall. Heavily indebted Asda is struggling to compete with both its bigger rivals Tesco and Sainsbury’s and discounters Aldi and Lidl despite promising to price match Aldi and Lidl on hundreds of products and expanding its cut price Essentials range. The latest figures the group has also spent £800m on replacing IT which had been provided by Asda’s former controlling shareholder Walmart. Brompton Bicycle sold nearly 2% fewer bikes last year but increased profits by 46% as the London-based group said it sold more directly to cyclists. The group paid its shareholders dividends of almost £1.2m, a similar amount to the year before as pre-tax profits rose to almost £10.7m in the year to March 2023. Total sales rose 21% to £129.4m reflecting a shift towards more premium bikes and the direct sales. However, shareholders pumped £19m into the business to pay off loans as Brompton said it was preparing for an “unpredictable” market as retailers had too many bicycles in stock after overestimating demand after the Covid-19 lockdown cycling boom. Ethical cosmetics group Lush has dived £28m into the red after sales fell in the US and Canada and it saw a “dramatic increase” in the cost of raw materials including glycerine and citric acid. The group said sales rose nearly 8% to £708m after it bought the struggling north American arm from its partner in 2022 and sales rose 2% in its UK home market according to accounts filed at Companies House on Friday. Lush said it would need additional funds ahead of Christmas and shareholders were set to put in £22m of funds while it expected its banks to lend further support but until those deals had been finalised there was a “material uncertainty” about whether the business was a going concern. Lush’s financial woes come as its key rival The Body Shop is being put up for auction after administrators to the UK arm failed to agree a restructuring deal with landlords that would have cut rents, as first reported by Sky News. Potential buyers are thought to include fashion and homewares retailer Next, which has recently snapped up a range of high street names from Joules to Reiss to sell via its online network and restructuring expert Gordon Brothers, which owns the Laura Ashley brand. However, the group’s former owner Aurelius, the German restructuring group which put the UK arm of The Body Shop into administration in February less than three months after taking control, is the prime bidder as it is the main creditor to the group. The inquiry into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has heard that former chief executive Paula Vennells did not believe there had been miscarriages of justice. The inquiry was told that Vennells – who is due to testify next week – did not accept that Post Office sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for stealing because of incorrect information from their computer system. Vennells “could not have got there emotionally”, a document prepared by Alisdair Cameron, the business’s current chief financial officer, in November 2020 stated. The document showed how Cameron believed the company “should have been tackling these issues 10 years ago” but it was not “practically possible” because claimants wanted “an apology as much as they wanted money”. He told the probe that Ms Vennells had been “clear in her conviction from the day I joined that nothing had gone wrong”. In the document, titled “what went wrong”, Cameron wrote: “We should have been tackling these issues 10 years ago. “However, I do not believe that an earlier settlement was practically possible because the serious claimants believed there had been a miscarriage of justice and required recognition and an apology as much as they wanted money. “Paula did not believe there had been a miscarriage and could not have got there emotionally.” More than 900 branch owner-operators were prosecuted by the Post Office despite protesting their innocence and raising issues with the software in their defence. Alan Bates, the former sub-postmaster and campaigner, has rejected his second offer of compensation for the Post Office Horizon IT scandal. This latest offer was only around a third of what had been requested by Bates – the inspiration for ITV’s Mr Bates vs The Post Office drama. The UK government must do more to bring energy prices down, says Mike Thornton, chief executive of Energy Saving Trust, following today’s forecast that bills will fall in July. “While it’s positive to see energy prices coming down for the next quarter, there’s much more this and future governments must do to both permanently lower energy costs and support progress towards net zero. “A key issue is that the relative cost of electricity has increased to around four times as high as the cost of gas. The continuing distortion of electricity prices is undermining the roll out of heat pumps, slowing down the move away from expensive and polluting fossil fuels in our homes. While the UK Government has committed to reviewing the way gas and electricity is priced more broadly, disappointingly it’s unlikely we’ll see tangible changes soon. A decision needs to be made in the short term to lower heat pump running costs and give people and industry a clear signal that low carbon heating will be part of a net zero future. “There is no time for delay. No one should take this lower price cap as a sign of stability, with forecasts showing that energy prices are set to rise again this autumn and will be staying high overall for the next decade. We still urgently need policies that support people to use less energy and install cost effective energy efficiency improvements in their homes, to bring down energy bills and carbon emissions for the long term.” Just in: the price cap on British energy bills are forecast to drop by over £100 per year this summer. Analysts at Cornwall Insight estimate that the price cap will drop by 7% when regulator Ofgemm sets it for the July – September quarter. That cap limits the maximum cost of each unit of energy, and Cornwalll estimate the bill for a typical dual fuel household would drop to £1,574 per year, down from £1,690 per year at present. They say: While a reduction in the price cap is good news, bills still remain hundreds of pounds above pre-crisis levels and concerns continue to be raised about the effectiveness of the price cap in bringing consumer costs down to more affordable levels for households. If Cornwall are right, this would mean the cap would be around £500 a year lower than last summer, when it was effectively £2,074 per year [although there is no limit on how much a customer could pay]. Cornwall also forecast the cap will rise slightly in October before falling again in January 2025. Getting back to the Royal Mail, the UK postal workers’ union has warned Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský they could call a strike if he fails to meet their demands in his Royal Mail takeover bid. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, told the Financial Times that the CWU would take “take whatever steps necessary to protect” employment conditions and Royal Mail’s universal service obligation. Ward added: “There are certain things that if they are attacked, we would take industrial action. We would call a ballot of our members.” Ward’s comments raise the threat of industrial action that has. disrupted operations in the past. The Royal Mail’s USO is to deliver letters to all addresses in the UK six days a week. The industry regulator, Ofcom, has been studying options to reform the USO, but changes are not expected before the next election. Today’s insolvency data shows the construction sector saw the highest number of company failure, at 17% of the total, followed by wholesale and retail trade and motor repairs at 16% and accommodation and food services at 15%. Insolvencies have risen the most in the hospitality sector versus a year ago, according to the Insolvency Service. Kelly Boorman, national head of construction at RSM UK, says building firms are recovering from “legacy contracts” in which costs were set before Covid-19, which drove up raw material costs. Boorman adds: Looking ahead in Q3 2024, we’re likely to see construction insolvencies accelerate, due to added strain in the market as businesses struggle with a lack of working capital, accumulated debt and falling cashflows brought about by legacy contracts. In addition, there’s growing uncertainty around future spend due to the political environment and looming general election, which is causing concerns around the supply chain, the government contracts that will be available, as well as the time to award and mobilise these projects. Although company insolvencies are climbing, they are still below the levels seen after the last financial crisis. Frances Coulson, head of insolvency and restructuring at law firm Wedlake Bell, says. UK companies are continuing to be hit by the tough economic climate, but that lenders are reluctant to put them into insolvency. Coulson says: Corporate insolvencies remain at a high level some 18% above last month and above March 23 and although the pressures on business are being somewhat ameliorated by easing of cost of borrowing and inflation, they are still likely to continue to do so for a while yet. Creditors voluntary liquidations are the highest but whilst the rates of corporate insolvency are higher they are nowhere near the 2008-9 financial crisis levels. Lenders still seem reluctant to press the insolvency buttons possibly because the value will be low unless there is a significant improvement in the economy. However, it still very much in evidence in our day-to-day work that companies are continuing to feel the pinch of a tough economic climate.” A takeover bid for Britain’s Royal Mail would be subject to “normal” national security scrutiny, says chancellor Jeremy Hunt. But Hunt also indicated that the government would not be opposed in principle to an overseas buyer taking control of the postal operator. Asked about Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský £3.5bn proposal to buy Royal Mail, Hunt told reporters: “As a rule, we welcome international investment in British companies”. Hunt argues that this open approach has helped the UK attract “greenfield foreign direct investment”, bringing in capital and expertise from overseas. The chancellor adds: “We will continue with that approach. But we do always look at national security considerations and make sure that in terms of our core infrastructure, there are no risks to those going forward. Any bid for Royal Mail will go through that normal process.” Landsec, one of Britain’s biggest developers, said more workers were returning to its offices, especially in the West End, but wrote down the value of its City of London office portfolio by nearly 14%. The company said the number of workers coming into its offices rose 18% across London in the past year. Chief executive Mark Allan explained that numbers were growing across all five weekdays but most strongly between Tuesdays and Thursdays. Allan added: “Being sat here in the City on a Friday morning and it was fairly busy on the way in, so I think things are continuing to grow steadily.” The company’s loss before tax narrowed to £341m in the year to 31 March from £622m the year before. It has invested heavily in the West End, where 72% of its London offices are, up from 48% three years ago. Landsec is also building more offices in Victoria and the South Bank and has a couple of projects in the City, the financial district that has been hit by the move to hybrid working. Allan said: “Our consented pipeline [projects with building permission] continues to focus in the main on the South Bank because it benefits from Waterloo station and London Bridge station as two of the three busiest overland stations in London. It’s got all of the well established immunity and vibrancy down there that employers and employees are looking for. So we expect to be investing into that Southbank portfolio for the next few years.” Virtually all of Landsec’s West End office space is occupied (99.6%) compared to 93.7% of City offices. It wrote down the value of the City office portfolio by 13.9%. Its shopping centres and outlets are 95.4% full. It owns malls such as Buchanan Street in Glasgow, Westgate in Oxford and Bluewater in Kent. Landsec has sold more than £600m of non-core assets such as hotels and retail parks in the last seven months. Allan said the UK property market was starting to recover, after high interest rates hampered developers’ ability to refinance. He had predicted “a period of at least 18 months of relatively limited transactional activity” in November 2022. “So we are pretty much now at the end of that 18-month period, and we are starting to see clear evidence of investors looking more seriously at some of these sectors again.” Today’s increase in insolvencies will be of no surprise to anyone who has been paying any attention to the economy recently, says Tom Pringle, restructuring and insolvency partner at the law firm Gowling WLG. Companies continue to weather the storms of Brexit, labour shortages and high inflation, often with balance sheets that are struggling to recover from the hit of the economic climate, and with the cost-of-living crisis hitting employees and customers alike. Now, a prolonged higher interest rate environment is chipping away at margins and threatening to pick companies off as they need to refinance or reconsider their survival-based options. Directors of struggling companies need to be aware that there are many options now available to them to save or rescue their businesses, as long as they get the right advice as early as possible and engage with key stakeholders. The longer this is delayed, the fewer options remain.” Newsflash: More companies and individuals across England and Wales fell into insolvency last month, as high interest rates continue to weigh. Company insolvencies jumped by 18% in April to 2,177, the Insolvency Service has reported. This included 300 compulsory liquidations, 1,715 creditors’ voluntary liquidations (CVLs), 144 administrations and 18 company voluntary arrangements (CVAs). CVLs allow the directors of an insolvent company to voluntarily wind the company upm while CVAs allow insolvent companies to keep trading, if their creditors agree. Companies are being hit by high borrowing rates, rising costs, and higher staff wages, explains David Hudson, restructuring advisory partner at FRP: “Last week’s GDP figures suggests that the UK economy is finally emerging from its lengthy post-Covid hangover. But while there is optimism this growth can be sustained, the coming months will continue to be turbulent with more business faltering as they weather the legacy of high interest rates, input costs and wage growth. “Indeed, while we anticipate monthly fluctuations as insolvency levels settle, our own data suggests the profile of firms going into administration is increasingly that of larger employers which will ultimately have a more pronounced effect on supply chains and the labour market.” Seperate data shows that 9,651 individuals entered insolvency in England &amp; Wales in April 2024, 10% higher than in March and 5% higher than in April 2023. The Bank of England is expanding its Leeds office, in a drive to enhance its staff presence across the country. The BoE has announced details of plans for an expanded and permanent presence in the city (whose football team is on the verge of a return to the top flight). It aims to have a headcount of at least 500 staff in Leeds by 2027, or around one in ten of its workforce. This will be done through voluntary internal relocations and new Leeds-based recruitment. The BoE says: The increased office space in Leeds aims to improve trust and wider understanding of the Bank’s work across the UK, ensure as an organisation it better represents the people it serves, help tap into wider talent pools across the UK, and retain talented colleagues. Three years ago, the Bank announced it would create a new northern hub in Leeds. But in November 2022, it put the plans on ice as it tried to examine ‘post-pandemic ways of working’. The Sunday Times also reports that the biggest risers on this year’s list are: Barnaby and Merlin Swire and family, the family’s two-century-old business owns a significant stake in Cathay Pacific and has extensive interests in Hong Kong (£8.82bn) Idan Ofer, is the son of Sammy Ofer, who built a shipping empire after serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War (£6.96bn) John Frederiksen and family, Fredriksen, a Norway-born Cypriot oil and tanker tycoon, has twin daughters who stand to inherit his empire. He owns a Chelsea mansion with a ballroom (£4.556bn) Today’s rich list is a reminder that those at the top of the wealth. pile are continuing to “coin it in”, says TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak: “We need an economy that rewards work not just wealth. “But as millions of families struggle to cover even the basics, the super-rich are amassing even greater fortunes. “The Conservatives have turned Britain into a land of grotesque extremes and rampant wealth inequality. “UK workers are in the worst cost of living crisis in generations with real wages still worth less than in 2008. “Meanwhile those at the top continue to coin it in. “This inequality is bad for living standards, bad for the economy and is holding the country back.” Bernie Ecclestone, the ex-Formula 1 boss, has roared into second place on the list of the UK’s largest taxpayers, a new entry, having handed over £652.6m in tax last year. But this largesse follows Ecclestone’s tax fraud conviction last year. And indeed, the Sunday Times describe Ecclestone as a “reluctant” entry – he agreed to pay £652m to HM Revenue and Customs after pleading guilty to fraud after being accused of not declaring more than £400m of overseas assets. Financial trader Alex Gerko is top of the taxpayers’ podium, having paid £664.5m, while. Denise, John and Peter Coates of Bet365 paid £375.9m of tax. An Essex businessman who won government contracts paying his firm £3.5m a day for transporting and accommodating asylum seekers has been named among the 350 richest people in the UK. Graham King, the founder and majority owner of a business empire that includes Clearsprings Ready Homes, which won a 10-year Home Office contract for housing thousands of asylum seekers, was on Friday named alongside King Charles III, the prime minister and Sir Paul McCartney on the Sunday Times rich list of the wealthiest people. King, 56, is estimated to have amassed a £750m fortune from “holiday parks, inheritance and housing asylum seekers for the government”. Clearsprings Ready Homes made £62.5m in profits after tax for the year ending January 2023, more than double its profits of £28m the previous year. King, ranked 221st, is one of several new entries to the 2024 rich list alongside Formula One driver Sir Lewis Hamilton and Tony and Cherie Blair’s son Euan, whose apprenticeship firm Multiverse is said to be worth £1.4bn. Britain is losing billionaires. This year’s Sunday Times rich list found there are 165 billionaires this year, down from 171 last year and a peak of 177 in 2022. This is the biggest drop since the list started being compiled in 1989, and shows – according to the ST – that the super-rich are. falling out of love with the UK. One lost billionaire is caravan park tycoon Alfie Best, now worth £947m, who shifted to Monaco six weeks ago. Best argues that Britain’s tax system and business regulations are “sterilising” wealth creators. The list cites some other examples: The tech entrepreneur Johnny Boufarhat has relocated to Switzerland. John Grayken, a Boston-born private equity tycoon, has quit London for Ireland. Telis Mistakidis, who built his fortune at the mining giant Glencore, has returned to Greece. The Norwegian shipping heir Trond Mohn and Nathan Kirsh, the South African owner of the City block once known as the NatWest Tower, have left the Rich List for the same reason. Yelena Baturina, once Russia’s wealthiest woman and who made her home in London, now lives in Austria. This exodus could accelerate if the Labour Party win the next election and clamp down on the non-dom system, which allows the wealthy to avoid paying tax here on earnings abroad. Chemicals billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s wealth shrank by over £6bn last year, according to this year’s rich list. That’s due to a 40% tumble in profits at Ineos, the energy giant which Ratcliffe build up, and which suffered from the jump in energy costs, plus inflation and higher interest rates. Ratcliffe’s wealth is this year estimated at £23.5bn, down from £29.7bn a year ago. Brexit-backing billionaire inventor Sir James Dyson also became poorer (although these things are relative….), with his estimated wealth dropping to £20.8bn from £23bn, despite his Dyson company continuing to produce new hair styling and cleaning products. The Hinduja family, led by Gopi Hinduja, retain their place at the top of the rich list this year. The Hinduja’s wealth rose by almost £2.2bn last year to £37.196bn, from a property-to-industrial conglomerate, which also covers energy and finance, from London. They recently transformed the Old War Office building in Whitehall into a Raffles hotel with 120 rooms, 11 restaurants and 85 serviced flats. In second place, with £29.246bn, is Sir Leonard Blavatnik. His investment group Access Industries holds a majority stake in Warner Music. Its value has jumped this year, lifting Blavatnik from third place a year ago. That bronze medal slot is now occupied by David and Simon Reuben and family, with £24.977bn. The Reubens are property tycoons, having first made a fortune in metals trading – purchasing Russian aluminium before buying up large tracts of London’s landmark buildings. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm was also asked what Musk might do if he loses the upcoming vote on his $56bn pay deal. Denholm says: “There is always a risk, but he’s not holding a gun to anybody’s head . . . He hasn’t said one way or another quite frankly. And do I believe he’s committed to Tesla? Absolutely.” Prime minister Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty have climbed up the list of the UK’s richest people, after their combined fortune rose by over £120m last year. The latest Sunday Times Rich List, just released, shows that Sunak and Murty are now worth £651m, up from £529m in 2023. That places them in 245th place on the List, up from 275th last year. Once again, Murty’s stake in Indian tech company Infosys provided the bulk of their fortune – over the last year, it has risen by £108.8m to nearly £590m. In contrast, Sunak’s tax details released in February showed that he had earned around £2.2m last year. But despite this jump in wealth, the couple are poorer than in 2022, when they burst onto the Rich List with around £730m. The Sunday Times helpfully runs through the couple’s assets: The couple’s main London home is a five-bedroom Kensington mews house worth an estimated £7 million. Soon after the row over Murty’s tax status erupted, the family moved out of Downing Street and back into their west London home. They also own a flat on Old Brompton Road in Kensington, usually used for hosting friends and family, and a Georgian manor house in the North Yorkshire village of Kirby Sigston, bought to serve as a constituency home in 2015 for £1.5 million. Estate agents estimate that additions including a gym, yoga studio, hot tub, tennis court and 12m x 5m indoor swimming pool have pushed the property’s value beyond £2 million. Then there is their £5.5 million penthouse in Santa Monica, California, bought from its developer in 2014. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Tesla faces a climb up “Mount Everest” as it tries to persuade shareholders to appprove a relocation to Texas and sign off – again – a $56bn pay deal for Elon Musk, according to the electric car company’s chair. Robyn Denholm, chair of Tesla’s board, is battling to win over shareholders ahead of an annual meeting next month. Denholm told the Financial Times: “We’re very early days of the campaign and we will be meeting with [shareholders] all the way through to the day of the vote. The vote’s pretty important for us as a company, but I also think it’s important for corporate America as well.” The controversial pay deal has already been backed once by shareholders, back in 2018, but was vetoed by a Delaware judge in January. But Tesla is refusing to let the matter lie, and has decided to put it to investors again – and also approve a decision to move the company’s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The pay vote is a simple majority, but to shift the incorporation requires a majority of all shares outstanding. That’s why Denholm sees a struggle; she says: “It’s like Mount Everest. It’s a huge hill to climb because getting 50 per cent of the shareholders to vote, let alone what they vote for, is quite tough.” The package grants stock option awards allowing Musk to buy Tesla stock at heavily discounted prices as escalating financial and operational goals are met. He must hold the acquired stock for five years. Denholm insists that every shareholder that she’s spoken to felt the pay deal worked, and “drove a lot of shareholder value.” This year has been tougher for Tesla, though. Shares are down 30% so far this year, it reported a 48% drop in profits in the last quarter, and Musk has fired almost all of Tesla’s electric-vehicle charging division.

        "title": "Shell urged to clarify climate targets as it braces for shareholder rebellion",
        "content": "Norway’s state investment fund has urged Shell to clarify its climate targets as the oil group braces for its biggest ever green shareholder rebellion at next week’s annual general meeting. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages $1.6tn on behalf of the people of Norway and is one of Shell’s largest investors, urged the company to give investors more information about its plans for the next decade after its new chief executive watered down climate commitments earlier this year. Shell’s board will on Tuesday face a shareholder resolution backed by 27 of its investors – holding 2.5% of its shares – calling for the company to align its business plans with the Paris climate agreement. The push, which has been coordinated by the Dutch campaign group Follow This, is understood to be the largest such climate rebellion mounted against Shell’s directors in terms of the size of the funds involved. NBIM, which invests the proceeds from Norway’s own fossil fuel reserves and holds just over 3% of Shell, has stopped short of backing the campaign but has called for the company to make “additional disclosures” to reduce the uncertainty over its climate agenda. Shell angered green groups earlier this year after its new chief executive watered down a key climate target as it prepared to grow its liquefied natural gas business through the 2030s. NBIM said Shell’s strategy “has evolved” under the leadership of Wael Sawan – who last year claimed it was “dangerous” to reduce fossil fuel production – but it still believed its strategy retained “the core components of a Paris-aligned transition plan”. Shell has signalled it may slow the pace of carbon reforms for this decade, with a plan to cut the emissions intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade, down from a previous target of 20%. It has not set a scope 3 emissions target for its gas business, which is expected to grow by 50% by 2040. “Our expectations ask for interim and net zero targets. We have encouraged Shell to make additional strategy disclosures that could reduce uncertainty about the company’s direction in the mid-2030s,” NBIM said. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said NBIM’s decision to vote against the campaign’s climate resolution “puts its climate credibility into question” and could delay Shell’s climate progress. “Why should Shell do more than just talk about climate if one of its biggest shareholders only talks and refuses to do the bare minimum, which is to vote for a climate resolution filed by 27 of its peers,” Van Baal said. The main investor proxy voting advisory agencies, Glass Lewis and ISS, have advised shareholders to vote against the Follow This resolution.",

        "title": "UK to look at security implications of Křetínský Royal Mail bid",
        "content": "The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has said the UK will look at the national security implications of a bid for Royal Mail by the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský, but indicated ministers were not opposed to the takeover in principle. Royal Mail’s owner, the London-listed International Distributions Services (IDS), on Wednesday backed a £3.5bn bid by Křetínský’s EP Group, after initially rejecting a £3.2bn offer. On Friday, Hunt indicated that the government would use its powers to scrutinise takeovers if they have national security implications, in a speech in London in which he also dangled the prospect of further tax cuts in the autumn. The national security checks could mean a lengthy process for Royal Mail’s takeover. The prospect of a foreign buyout of one of the oldest parts of the UK’s infrastructure has caused alarm in some quarters, including some MPs, unions representing postal workers, and campaigners for the rights of elderly people – who fear that less profitable parts of the 508-year-old service could be cut back. The share price of Royal Mail’s owner has soared 50% since the first bid a month ago to a two-year high, although at £3.21 it remains short of the £3.70-a-share bid. Hunt said “as a rule we welcome international investment in British companies”, and praised the UK’s “openness to companies from overseas and not just the capital they bring in, but the expertise and the funding”. He said: “And so we will continue with that approach, but we do always look at national security considerations and make sure that in terms of our core infrastructure there are no risks to that going forward. Any bid for Royal Mail will go through that normal process.” Křetínský made his fortune through buying up coal-fired power stations in eastern Europe, but he has since turned his attention to the UK, including taking separate stakes in Sainsbury’s supermarket and West Ham football club. The Communication Workers Union, the biggest union representing Royal Mail workers, has said it is prepared to call a ballot on industrial action if it feels Křetínský is trying to cut back workers’ pay or employment conditions. The government introduced the national security and investment act in 2022 to allow it to intervene in takeovers in certain sectors, ranging from military technology and cryptography to energy, computing, quantum technology and even some transport. Since then the government has blocked some transactions under the laws, including the attempted takeover of the Newport Wafer Fab semiconductor factory in south Wales and the purchase of the electronic design company Pulsic by a Hong Kong rival. The government last week cleared the merger of Vodafone and Three’s UK mobile networks on security grounds, although a competition inquiry is still running. The business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, has also reportedly told Royal Mail that the sale will not be allowed unless it offers guarantees that some services are maintained.",

        "title": "Air Up: scent-flavoured water bottle becomes latest playground craze",
        "content": "From loom bands to fidget spinners, playground crazes are usually cheap and cheerful, but the latest must-have is an expensive drinks bottle that comes with scent pods that trick your brain into thinking water is cola or fruit juice. The growing popularity of Air Up, with the cheapest bottles starting at about £30, is a dilemma for parents. On the one hand it is a lot to pay when standard reusable flasks can cost a couple of pounds, but on the other it might keep children away from sugary drinks. Lena Jüngst, who co-founded Air Up while a student, is bemused by its coveted status in British classrooms. “It is a really funny effect,” she said, adding the company set out to make “responsible consumption more attractive” and to encourage adults to drink more water. When it launched in 2019 the Munich-based startup’s pitch to customers – that the bottle would see them “experience water like never before” – was aimed at health-conscious gen Z’s and millennials. However, the brand soon went viral on TikTok and the rest is history. Air Up went on sale in the UK in 2021 and Jüngst said that as it became more popular the sales data revealed a large cohort of 40-year-olds who it turned out were parents buying for kids. “It was not on purpose, but in the UK 60% of our consumers are kids,” she said. The bottles work with circular pods that fit on the neck of the bottle. Drinking from the straw creates a suction that transports the water and also air from the outside through the pod into the mouth. According to the “How it works” section of the Air Up website, “about 80% of what we perceive as flavour is actually derived from what we’re smelling”. So what makes you experience flavoured water is simply smelling the aroma – made from natural ingredients such as fruits, herbs and spices – that comes out of the pod as you drink. There are nearly 30 pod flavours, ranging from lemon, lime and blackcurrant to the more wacky chocolate orange and iced coffee, with the company estimating that the drinks work out at roughly 33p a litre. Jüngst says the “sky’s the limit” when it comes to flavour. “Kola” is its most popular but “you could make bacon or summer rain”. “We want to go a lot more experimental and wild.” “There is a very tiny amount of transference of the aroma into the water but it’s so small, it has no impact on the body,” she said, with the company likening the intake to inhaling fresh bread in a bakery. Reusable bottles are big business in their own right these days, with the global market worth more than £7bn and tipped to grow at 4% a year for the next decade. This is thanks to a shift in consumer attitudes. While in 2015, just 20% of people in the UK used a refillable water bottle, research now suggests that figure is 65%, yet 10m single-use water bottles are still bought every day. From nothing five years ago, Air Up turned over €200m (£171m) in 2023, a rapid rise that has attracted the attention of brands such as PepsiCo, which is an investor, with actor Ashton Kutcher among the celebrity shareholders that seem to be de rigueur for growing brands these days. But with reusable water bottles also now a competitive fashion market – from the oversized Stanley water cups to high-end bottles that come with accompanying apps to monitor your intake – is Air Up just another fad? Jüngst insists that’s a no. “What makes us different to all the other water bottles in the market is that we sell healthy flavour.” The idea behind reusable bottles is they are supposed to last a lifetime, potentially replacing the thousands of single-use plastic water bottles you might otherwise have consumed, explains Jane Martin, the chief executive of environmental charity City to Sea. She said the growing popularity of refillable water bottles, especially among young people, “is of course positive” but that it was important to “consider the flip side of the impact of new product development from brands adding to consumption culture, and therefore undermining the principles behind refill and reuse”.",

        "title": "British asylum housing tycoon breaks into Sunday Times rich list",
        "content": "An Essex businessman who won government contracts paying his company £3.5m a day for transporting and accommodating asylum seekers has been named among the 350 richest people in the UK. Graham King, the founder and majority owner of a business empire that includes Clearsprings Ready Homes, which won a 10-year Home Office contract for housing thousands of asylum seekers, was on Friday named alongside King Charles III, the prime minister and Sir Paul McCartney on the Sunday Times rich list of the wealthiest people. King, 56, is estimated to have amassed a £750m fortune from “holiday parks, inheritance and housing asylum seekers for the government”. Clearsprings Ready Homes made £62.5m in profits after tax for the year ending January 2023, more than double its profits of £28m the previous year. Ranked 221st, King is one of several new entries to the 2024 rich list alongside the Formula One driver Sir Lewis Hamilton and Tony and Cherie Blair’s son Euan, whose apprenticeship firm Multiverse is said to be worth £1.4bn. The newspaper estimated that Blair, 40, has built up a £375m fortune – far more than his father’s speculated £47m – making him the 337th-richest person in the country. Blair has claimed that some young people turned down places at Oxford to join his scheme. His business, co-founded with his friend Sophie Adelman, offers what he claims is “a genuine, credible alternative that can compete with university”. The Hinduja brothers retained the title of the UK’s richest people with an estimated fortune of £37.2bn, up from £35bn last year – and the largest fortune recorded in the newspaper’s 36 years of ranking the wealthy. However, this year’s list reveals the largest fall in the number of billionaires – from 177 to 165 – in its history. “This year’s Sunday Times rich list suggests Britain’s billionaire boom has come to an end,” said Robert Watts, the compiler of the list. “Many of our homegrown entrepreneurs have seen their fortunes fall and some of the global super-rich who came here are moving away.” Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the founder of the petrochemicals company Ineos, who this year bought a 27.7% stake in Manchester United, is named as the biggest loser on the list, with a £6.2bn decline in his fortune to £29.7bn. The richest 350 individuals and families together hold a combined wealth of £795bn – a sum larger than the annual GDP of Poland. Meanwhile the personal fortune of Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, has increased by £120m to an estimated £651m in the run-up to the next general election, the list reveals. Priya Sahni-Nicholas, a co-executive director of the Equality Trust, a charity that campaigns for the creation of a fairer society, said the list “demonstrates the obscene extent of inequality” in the UK. “Billionaire wealth is up by more than 1,000% since 1990 at a very real cost to us all,” she said. “This rich list is built off record bill increases, massive price hikes for essentials, an endless shortage of decent homes, and huge investment in fossil fuels. “To make progress on these crises we must tackle inequality. The super-rich have spent centuries diverting wealth into their hands, making our democracy less responsive to people’s needs and damaging our communities. The result is we are poorer, sicker, less productive, unhappier, more polarised, and less trusting.” Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre, a thinktank focused on pay, corporate governance and responsible business, said: “The rich list always prompts intense interest in billionaire rivalry over who’s up and who’s down, but as a society we should also ask whether this represents a fair, proportionate or efficient allocation of resources. “Twelve of the top 20 rich-list entrants inherited their wealth or business. They all depend on the workers at the companies they own and invest in, or the public services and infrastructure that enable the economy to function. “Allowing such a tiny number of people to capture such a huge share of collectively created wealth is not an inevitability but a policy choice that needs to be properly debated.” Researchers at the University of Greenwich worked out that the wealth of the 200 richest families has ballooned from £42bn to £711bn since the rich list began 36 years ago, while the overall public wealth of the country has fallen from £337bn to a shared debt of £1tn. Ben Tippet, a lecturer in economics at the University of Greenwich, said: “When the rich list was first published in 1989, The queen sat at the top of the list. Today, the king has been pushed down to 258th place, as business owners, aristocrats, celebrities, and others have accumulated vast and unimaginable fortunes. “During this time, the wealthiest 200 people have seen their wealth grow on average by 5.2% per year in real terms, compared to just 1.6% for GDP. As the economy continues to stagnate and the UK government accumulates more debts than assets, we need to remember that the UK does have a growth model – it’s just for the super rich.” Sunday Times rich list 2024: top 20 1 Gopi Hinduja and family £37.196bn (industry and finance: Hinduja Group). 2 Sir Leonard Blavatnik £29.246bn (Investment, music and media: Access Industries). 3 David and Simon Reuben and family £24.977bn (Property and internet: Reuben Brothers). 4 Sir Jim Ratcliffe £23.519bn (Chemicals: Ineos Group). 5 Sir James Dyson and family £20.8bn (Technology: Dyson Group). 6 Idan Ofer £14.96bn (Shipping and industry: Israel Corp). 7 Lakshmi Mittal and family £14.921bn (Steel: ArcelorMittal). 8 Guy, George, Alannah and Galen Weston Jr and family £14.493bn (Retail: Primark). 9 John Fredriksen and family £12.867bn (Shipping and oil services). 10 Kirsten and Jorn Rausing £12.634bn (Inheritance and investment: Tetra Laval). 11 Alex Gerko £12.055bn (Finance: XTX Markets). 12 Michael Platt £12bn (Hedge fund: BlueCrest Capital Management). 13 Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken and Michel de Carvalho £11.751bn (Inheritance, brewing and banking: Heineken). 14 The Duke of Westminster and the Grosvenor family £10.127bn (Property: Grosvenor Group). 15 Barnaby and Merlin Swire and family £9.9bn (Industry, transport and property: Swire Group). 16 Marit, Lisbet, Sigrid and Hans Rausing £9.188bn (Inheritance: Tetra Laval). 17 Carrie and François Perrodo and family £9.168bn (Oil, gas and wine: Perenco). 18 Nicky Oppenheimer and family £7.937bn (Diamonds and mining: De Beers). 19 Lord Bamford and family £7.65bn (Construction equipment: JCB). 20 Denise, John and Peter Coates £7.467bn (Gambling: Bet365). • This article was amended on 24 and 31 May 2024. The richest people in Britain have seen their wealth grow, in real terms, by an annual average of 5.2% since 1989, not 15% as an earlier version said, owing to incorrect figures provided to us; meanwhile the average annual GDP growth over the same period was 1.6%, not 2%. Incorrect information also meant that Barnaby and Merlin Swire and family were originally placed in sixth position with a net worth of £17.2bn, instead of the correct position of 15th with £9.9bn.",

        "content": "The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has announced a big expansion of its operations in Leeds, with one in 10 officials to be based in the West Yorkshire city within three years. Bailey said the 70-strong team at the central bank’s northern hub would swell sevenfold to 500 by 2027 through a combination of voluntary relocation and local recruitment. The Bank said its increased presence in Leeds was aimed at improving trust and wider understanding of its work across the UK, ensuring it better represented the public, and would help tap into wider talent pools across the country and retain talented colleagues. Threadneedle Street’s links with Leeds stretch back 200 years, and it was among the earliest locations proposed when the Bank began considering establishing a network of branches in the 1800s. Three years ago, it announced plans to open a northern hub in the city, which is already one of the UK’s biggest financial centres outside London. Bailey said: “Committing to a permanent, expanded Leeds office is a fantastic opportunity for us better to represent the public, build stronger links with the local business community and help promote the work of the Bank to a wider pool of talented workers.” The Bank will aim to maintain its overall headcount – which stood at 4,971, according to its 2023 report and accounts – while expanding its numbers in Leeds. The councillor James Lewis, the leader of Leeds city council, said: “We are delighted that the Bank of England has chosen to expand their office space in Leeds. “Leeds is the UK’s second largest city for financial services, and a major hub for related professional services; this move further reinforces the city’s progress and influence and showcases the strength of Team Leeds and the partners across the private and public sectors, that come together to deliver brilliant results in a truly collaborative way, for the best impact on our residents.”",

        "title": "Swimming boss defends athletes lobbying national gallery to take down Gina Rinehart portraits",
        "content": "The head of Swimming Queensland has defended a campaign that saw Olympic champions lobby the National Gallery of Australia to take down portraits of their patron, Gina Rinehart, because they were deemed “offensive”. An acrylic colour portrait by Vincent Namatjira of Australia’s richest woman was the target of the campaign along with a second black and white portrait by Namatjira in ink and pencil. The colour piece – arguably an unflattering picture of the mining magnate – is one of 21 portraits of prominent Australian and international figures that make up the artwork titled Australia in Colour. Rinehart’s company Hancock Prospecting is a major sponsor of Australian Olympic sports – funding sports bodies as well as individual athletes. The sponsorship is often conditional, however. In 2022, Rinehart withdrew a $15m sponsorship of Netball Australia after the Indigenous netballer Donnell Wallam asked for her uniform not to carry the Hancock Prospecting logo. Rinehart later set up a $3m fund to reward athletes who won gold medals or set world records in swimming, artistic swimming, rowing and volleyball. Hancock Prospecting has sponsored Australian swimmers to the tune of $40m. The Swimming Queensland chief executive, Kevin Hasemann, coordinated a group of Australian athletes – including Rio Olympic freestyle gold medallist Kyle Chalmers – to request the portraits be removed. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Hasemann wrote a letter to the director of the national gallery, Nick Mitzevich, which he said was sent “on behalf of members of the Australian swim team”. “Two portraits of our patron, Mrs Gina Rinehart AO, are of deep concern to us because they are offensive to Mrs Rinehart,” he wrote in April. “Through her philanthropy, Mrs Rinehart has proven herself to be a great Australian, and we respectfully urge you to reconsider the inclusion of these portraits in your galleries.” Hasemann told ABC radio on Friday that the debate over the portraits had “evolved into something I could never have imagined”. “Art is certainly not my forte,” Hasemann said. “I’ve never been to a gallery, I’m a sports administrator. I don’t know why we have to defend ourselves. We simply, privately, did what the gallery actually encourages. It says it likes debate. It encourages that. [We asked] ‘pretty please would you mind taking it down?’ If they don’t, that’s their right.” Hasemann said Rinehart had been the saviour of swimming “and Kyle Chalmers is pretty much saying the same thing”. “There are about 100 swimmers that receive funding from Mrs Rinehart. There’s great affection for Mrs Rinehart in swimming. She’s a champion to us.” Rinehart herself demanded the Australia in Colour portrait be removed from the gallery, it was revealed earlier this week. The national gallery rejected requests for the pictures to be taken down but said it welcomed public debate on exhibitions. “We present works of art to the Australian public to inspire people to explore, experience and learn about art,” the gallery said in a statement. Western Aranda artist Vincent Namatjira, an Archibald prize winner and the great-grandson of famed watercolourist Albert Namatjira, is renowned for his portraits of famous figures. He has defended his works as being representative of his worldview. “I paint the world as I see it,” Namatjira said on Thursday. “People don’t have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, ‘why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?’ I paint people who are wealthy, powerful, or significant – people who have had an influence on this country, and on me personally, whether directly or indirectly, whether for good or for bad. “Some people might not like it, other people might find it funny, but I hope people look beneath the surface and see the serious side too.” Rinehart was contacted for comment.",

        "title": "Union urges Labour not to ban new North Sea licences without plan for jobs",
        "content": "The UK’s oil and gas workers risk becoming “the coal miners of our generation,” Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, has warned, urging Labour not to ban new North Sea licences without a clear plan to safeguard jobs. Unite is launching a billboard campaign in six Scottish constituencies aimed at persuading Keir Starmer to commit more investment to north-east Scotland, the centre of the offshore oil and gas industry. Unless Labour can show it will protect jobs and communities, it should be willing to continue issuing new licences for oil and gas exploration, Unite argues. The slogan for the union’s campaign is “No Ban Without A Plan”. “They are at risk of becoming the coal miners of our generation,” Graham said. “We only have to look at what’s happened in the coal towns. I’m the daughter of mining stock – my family’s from the north-east, lots of them were miners. And it’s decimation in some of these places. They’ve never recovered. And the difference is, we know this time – we can see it coming down the track.” The shadow climate secretary, Ed Miliband, has promised to base Labour’s planned state-backed green power firm, Great British Energy, in Scotland. And part of Labour’s £7bn “wealth fund” will be earmarked for wind power. But Unite, which was Labour’s biggest donor in the 2019 general election, wants to see more specific pledges of investment in green technologies in north-east Scotland. Graham said Unite research suggested that £6bn over six years would be needed to kickstart wind turbine manufacture in the region. “You should not be letting go of one rope before you’ve got hold of another,” she said. “My main thing is that I cannot allow these workers to be sacrificed on the altar of net zero.” She claimed a clear offer on jobs and investment would help Labour make much-hoped-for gains in Scotland. “Labour would be the heroes of the hour. Why wouldn’t you do that?” she said. Most of the seats in which Unite is running its No Ban Without a Plan campaign – or their predecessors before boundary changes – are held by the SNP with comfortable majorities. Two are Aberdeenshire North and Moray East, and Aberdeen North. Despite the imperative for the UK to move away from fossil fuels, some unions expressed alarm last year when Labour first announced that it would not issue new licences for oil and gas exploration. The GMB general secretary, Gary Smith, called the decision naive. Starmer responded by saying to the GMB’s conference last June: “What I will never let happen is a repeat of what happened in coal mining where an industry came to an end and nobody had planned for the future.” But Labour went on to drop its £28bn-a-year green investment pledge, sparking concerns among unions and environmental campaigners about whether it had set aside sufficient resources to smooth the transition to a net-zero economy. Chaitanya Kumar, of the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: “The oil and gas industry is ultimately a threat to us all and needs to be scaled down considerably. But ensuring a fair transition deal for workers is non-negotiable. Fortunately, Labour still have the time to come up with a plan without compromising on its commitment to stop new drilling of fossil fuels.” According to industry estimates cited by the campaign group Uplift, which calls for a “rapid and fair” transition away from oil and gas in the UK, the sector supports 200,000 jobs either directly or indirectly, in the supply chain – a third fewer than a decade ago, as output has declined over time. Uplift director Tessa Khan said any government should work with local communities to manage the shift away from fossil fuels. “This part of the climate energy transition is going to require a huge amount of industrial change, and we absolutely cannot afford to victimise or throw communities under the bus,” she said. A Labour source said: “Labour has a non-negotiable commitment to a proud future for the North Sea. We will deliver the most significant investment in the North Sea in a generation as we pursue our mission for energy independence and lower bills. “If the Conservatives in Westminster and the SNP in Holyrood are re-elected they will continue to sell out workers and communities by leaving the industry without a plan for the future, as they have done for the last 14 years.” Graham has made workplace battles on pay and conditions, rather than internal Labour politics, the centrepiece of her leadership since succeeding Len McCluskey, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, three years ago. However, she has previously pushed for stronger commitments from Labour on protecting jobs in the steel sector, and she attended a crunch meeting this week on the party’s policy on workers’ rights. Jamie Peters, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Two things are clear as we head towards the next general election. Firstly, any incoming government must accelerate our shift to a clean energy system, including no new oil and gas in the North Sea. This is the bottom line if we’re to meet our climate goals and stem the very worst of climate breakdown. “And secondly, the transition must be designed in a way that’s fair, with workers and new jobs in emerging green industries at its heart, ensuring that no one gets left behind as we build a brighter future. What we’re yet to see is a plan for a cleaner Britain that’s equal parts rapid, ambitious and fair.”",

        "title": "Chevron to sell off its remaining North Sea oil and gas fields",
        "content": "Chevron is preparing to call time on more than five decades in the North Sea with a plan to sell its remaining oil and gas fields in the ageing oil basin. The US oil company said on Thursday that it will launch a sale of its North Sea interests, including a 19.4% stake in the giant Claire oilfield in the West of Shetland region, which could raise up to $1bn. The US “supermajor”, which has a market value of almost $300bn, said the decision to leave the North Sea after more than 55 years operating in UK waters followed a review of its global operations to set which assets remain “strategic and competitive”. The company denied that the decision was linked to the UK government’s tax regime, which imposed a 35% windfall tax on North Sea producers after the surge in global energy markets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. The timing of the decision has reportedly coincided with a key meeting between Jeremy Hunt and the leaders of many North Sea oil companies, in which the executives called for the tax to be dropped. The chancellor refused to commit to easing the levy, according to the Daily Telegraph. Oil companies could face higher taxes under a Labour government. The party has pledged to raise the windfall tax, known as the energy profits levy, to bring the total tax on North Sea profits to 78%. This tax rate, which is in line with Norway’s tax regime, could raise £10bn for the Treasury, according to the party. The Claire oilfield is the largest in the UK’s North Sea basin. It produces about 120,000 barrels of oil a day and holds reserves of up 8bn barrels. Chevron will sell its interests in the Sullom Voe Terminal, the Ninian pipeline and the Shetland Islands Regional Gas Export pipeline. The company was one of the first oil companies to drill in the North Sea in the 1960s and is one of the last major oil companies still operating in the oil basin. It began its retreat in 2018 with the sale of its stake in the controversial Rosebank oil development to Equinor, followed by the sale of many of its North Sea assets to Ithaca Energy a year later. Other major oil companies – including Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Shell – have all shrunk their interests in the basin since the 2000s as reserves have declined and new oil frontiers have opened up in other parts of the world.",

        "title": "Dow Jones passes 40,000 points for first time amid strong quarterly results",
        "content": "The Dow Jones industrial average briefly passed 40,000 points for the first time on Thursday, powered by strong quarterly results from corporate America and rising bets of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The uptick was short-lived, though, as the Dow closed slightly down from earlier in the day. The index closed at 39,869 – just under the 40,000 benchmark it surpassed earlier in the day. Still, the rally shows resilience in the US economy as the index has more than doubled since the spring of 2020 when the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 to be a global pandemic. The outbreak shuttered businesses worldwide as the death toll mounted. In its wake came supply chain issues that led to soaring inflation. The US has staged a remarkable recovery despite widespread predictions of disaster in the face of runaway prices and the Federal Reserve’s aggressive series of interest rate hikes, aimed at tamping down inflation. On Wednesday, government figures showed that the annual rate of inflation, which peaked at over 9% in June 2022, had slowed to 3.4% in April, down from 3.5% in the previous month. The rate is still far higher than the Fed’s target of 2% annual inflation but the details in the report cheered investors and increased expectations that the Fed will start cutting interest rates later this year. The Dow is an index of 30 of the US’s most prominent companies, including Amazon, Apple, McDonald’s and Nike. Hopes that artificial intelligence will create a new wave of tech innovation – and wealth – and a series of positive reports from Dow constituents have pushed up the index. On Thursday another of its constituents, the retail giant Walmart, released better than expected quarterly results, helping the Dow break the 40,000 barrier. John Lynch, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management, hailed the Dow’s drive to 40,000 points, telling CNBC: “This achievement is a testament to the powers of capital formation, innovation, profit growth and economic resilience.” The stock market rise comes as the US has continued to report strong growth in the jobs market. Unemployment has remained below 4% for over two years – the longest such streak since the 1950s. But despite rising stock markets and low unemployment, consumer confidence has sagged, plunging to its lowest level in six months according to a University of Michigan survey of consumers released earlier this month. “While consumers had been reserving judgment for the past few months, they now perceive negative developments on a number of dimensions. They expressed worries that inflation, unemployment and interest rates may all be moving in an unfavorable direction in the year ahead,” said the University of Michigan’s surveys of consumers director, Joanne Hsu. The split between poor consumer sentiment and buoyant economic indicators has presented Joe Biden with a major obstacle ahead of November’s election. Polling has consistently shown voters regard his predecessor, Donald Trump, as a better economic leader than Biden. The Biden campaign took to X to poke fun at Trump, who has claimed on numerous occasions that stock markets and the wider economy would crash under Biden.",

        "title": "Union warns of threat to Harland & Wolff  jobs if Treasury vetoes £200m support ",
        "content": "A union representing workers at the historic Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard in Belfast has written to the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, warning that doubts over financial support for the company are putting jobs in jeopardy. The GMB said workers were concerned by claims that a £200m export guarantee could be blocked by the Treasury, despite having the backing of the ministries for defence, business and trade, and Northern Ireland. The news follows reports that the chancellor is considering blocking the controversial £200m financial support package for the company, which also owns facilities in Devon and Scotland as well as the Belfast shipyard, which is famous for being the place where the doomed liner Titanic was built. The row has cast doubts over the government’s commitment to spreading contracts for navy ships across the UK under its national shipbuilding strategy, and the suggestion by the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, in a speech on Tuesday that the UK had entered a “golden age of shipbuilding”. Harland &amp; Wolff is part of a consortium with Spain’s state-owned Navantia that was awarded a £1.6bn contract to build “fleet solid support ships” – auxiliary vessels designed to transport ammunition and other provisions to Royal Navy warships. In the letter to Hunt, the GMB’s general secretary, Gary Smith, wrote: “The workforce at Harland &amp; Wolff are maximising UK manufactured content that supports growth and security of UK capabilities, in areas that need these jobs and apprenticeships – Northern Ireland, Devon, the Outer Hebrides and Fife. “All of this is being placed in jeopardy by the time it is taking to get a [UK Export Finance] guarantee to allow the business to refinance.” Harland &amp; Wolff has applied for a £200m guarantee from UK Export Finance, a government body. The guarantee would allow it to borrow to pay off expensive debts owed to Riverstone Credit Partners, a US investor. However, the Treasury is reportedly considering vetoing the support, which would underwrite £200m in loans to a company whose stock market value this week slumped to £17m. The Harland &amp; Wolff yard is well known in Belfast because of its two yellow cranes – Samson and Goliath – that dominate the city’s skyline. However, the London-headquartered company bearing its name only bought the famous shipyard out of administration in 2019, before adopting the historic brand in 2021. The company has not made a profit since shifting focus from developing a gas storage project to taking over the shipyard. It lost nearly £100m in 2021 and 2022. The award of the £1.6bn contract to Harland &amp; Wolff and Navantia has proved controversial, given the UK company’s relatively small size and limited experience. Kevan Jones, Labour MP for North Durham, said he was concerned that the Royal Navy’s fleet solid support ships would have to be built entirely at Navantia’s Cádiz yard if Harland &amp; Wolff were to fail. That would undermine the British government’s hopes to keep jobs and expertise in the UK. “Awarding this contract in the first place went against the interest of the national shipbuilding strategy,” Jones said. “Questions need to be asked why – knowing what we know now about Harland &amp; Wolff – they were given the multibillion-pound contract in the first place.” Gavin Robinson, the interim leader of the Democratic Unionist party and the MP for the Belfast East constituency, which contains the shipyard, said on Wednesday that reports that the company could collapse were “wide of the mark” and that there was “strong support for the yard in London”. Ben Wallace, who was defence secretary until last summer, told the Times, which first reported the suggestion the £200m support package could be withheld, that the Treasury had been “hostile” to the national shipbuilding strategy and that it had “continued to hamper efforts to put the UK shipbuilding back on track”. Harland &amp; Wolff said on Wednesday it was “comfortable with progress on what is a complex and large transaction for all parties involved”, in a statement to the stock market. A government spokesperson said: “We continue to engage with Harland &amp; Wolff on the export development guarantee. Due to commercial sensitivities, it would not be appropriate to comment further until the outcome of the process is confirmed. No final decisions on the provision of support have been made.” Harland &amp; Wolff did not respond to requests for comment. Navantia declined to comment.",

        "content": "Time to wrap up…. The Dow Jones Industrial Average passed 40,000 points for the first time on Thursday, powered by strong quarterly results from corporate America and rising bets of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The index has more than doubled since the spring of 2020 when the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 to be a global pandemic.

And here are the rest of today’s business news stories: A group of UK social media influencers from reality TV shows including The Only Way Is Essex and Love Island have been charged in relation to promotions of unauthorised investments. The weight loss market is heating up, with the Swiss drugmaker Roche reporting that its once-weekly obesity injection delivered almost 19% weight loss in early trials. Like the popular weight loss treatments from Denmark’s Novo Nordisk and US firm Eli Lilly, Roche’s CD-388 drug is part of a new class of drugs that mimic the action of a gut hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and suppresses appetite. Over 24 weeks, it led to 18.8% weight loss. This compares with 21% weight loss over 72 weeks for Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, and 15% weight loss over 68 weeks for Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy. Roche’s share price rose more than 3% today. Side effects were similar to those experienced by people taking Zepbound and Wegovy, such as nausea and vomiting, described as “mild to moderate gastrointestinal-related adverse events” by Roche. It acquired the treatment via its $2.7bn acquisition of the Californian biotech Carmot Therapeutics in December. The company is also trialling the drug in obese people with type 2 diabetes over 12 weeks, with results expected in the second half of this year. Like Zepbound, the Roche drug works by mimicking GLP-1 and another gut hormone called GIP. This could lead to stronger weight loss and reduction in blood sugar with fewer side effects than drugs such as Wegovy, which is only based on GLP-1. Levi Garraway, Roche’s chief medical officer and head of global product development, said: “We are very pleased to see the significant and clinically meaningful weight loss in people treated with CT-388. The results are highly encouraging for further development of CT-388 for both obesity and type 2 diabetes and underscore its potential to become a best-in-class therapy with durable weight loss and glucose control.” However, Roche did not say how high its weekly doses were and analysts said the company still has a long way to go. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, says: “Investors have been pumped up by the latest inflation reading, believing it is cool enough to stir the Federal Reserve into action and cut rates in the near future. It also helps that quite a few US companies are getting a positive reaction to their latest results, together lifting the general mood around the markets and firing up enthusiasm to make trades.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average has rallied by around 45% since early November 2020, when Joe Biden beat Donald Trump in the presidential election. That rather refutes Trump’s claim during a presidential debate in 2020 that the stock market would crash if Biden was elected president. The sight of the Dow hitting the 40k mark today should cheer followers of author David Elias. Back in 1999, he published. Dow 40,000: Strategies for Profiting from the Greatest Bull Market in History. That book argued that investors should look to profit from a strong bull market, and outlined various strategies to do it. At the time, the Dow was trading around 10,000 points, and 40,000 looked a very long way away. Eias, though, predicted it would hit 40k by 2016 – so he was eight years early…. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, points out that investors who ignored gloomy forecasts last year have profited from the stock market rally: 40,000 is a great milestone, but end of the day there isn’t much difference between 39,999 and 40k. Still, this is a great reminder of how far we’ve come. Think about how many people were talking about recessions and bear markets all of last year, now we are once again back to new highs. Investors who were patient and ignored all the scary headlines were once again rewarded, just as they have been throughout history. Can stocks keep going? Detrick thinks they can, and predicts markets will show more strenth this year. He explains\": Earnings continue to surprise to the upside, balance sheets for corporate American are in great shape, while the consumer might have some cracks, but is still strong thanks to a very healthy employment backdrop. Then consider lower rates are likely coming, thanks to inflation that should drastically improve the second half of this year. It is an election year, so expect some bumps, but overall the bull market that stared in October 2022 is alive and well in our view. Hitting the 40,000-point mark is a milestone that could lift spirits on Wall Street. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, explains in a research note today: “Breaking the 40,000 barrier is a big psychological boost for the bulls as round numbers hold special significance in people’s hearts and minds. “We are in a Bull Market and people are showing some irrational exuberance (meme stocks) and dismissing bad news (slowing retail sales) and focusing on good news (slightly slowing inflation).” But the meme stock exuberance appears to be fading today. Electronics retailer Gamestop have tumbled by 23.8% this morning – earlier this week it jumped by 100%, in turbulent trading…. The new record for the Dow highlights a notable contrast between sentiment on Wall Street and Main Street, points out CNN, adding: Consumer sentiment plunged to the lowest level in six months as price increases reaccelerated, according to a University of Michigan survey of consumers released earlier this month. Weak industrial production data helped give the Dow a push to the heady heights of 40,000 points today. Federal Reserve data released just before the New York stock market opened showed that US industrial production stagnated in April, while manufacturing output fell 0.3%, held back by motor-vehicle production. This is not encouraging news; but in the tipsy-topsy world of Wall Street, bad news is good, as it may encourage the Fed to cut rates soon. John Lynch, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management, has hailed the Dow’s drive to 40,000 points, telling CNBC: “This achievement is a testament to the powers of capital formation, innovation, profit growth, and economic resilience.” [although, as flagged earlier, enthusiasm around artificial intelligence and hopes that central banks will ease monetary policy are also factors…] Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average, America’s much-storied stock index, has hit the 40,000 point mark for the first time, as traders anticipate interest rate cuts. The Dow, which contains 30 major US companies, nudged a new alltime high of 40,000.54 points in morning trading in New York. Hypermarket giant Walmart are the top riser on the Dow, up over 6%, after announcing better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter. Other top risers today include aeroplane manufacturer Boeing (+3%) and conglomerate 3M (+3%). The rally comes as investors continue to hope that the Federal Reserve will start to cut interest rate this year, after US inflation yesterday dropped to 3.4%. The US stock market is having a good year, with technology stocks booming on the back of hopes for artificial intelligence systems. Rania Gule, market analyst at XS.com, explains: Overall expectations for the stock market remain positive, especially with supportive monetary policy expectations and continued corporate growth, especially in the technology and artificial intelligence sectors. However, I advise traders here and at this stage to remain cautious of volatility, especially in stocks that have shown significant price fluctuations influenced by social media and retail investor sentiment. Nevertheless, I believe prevailing economic conditions and policy expectations indicate that the upward trend in major stock indices is likely to continue in the short to medium term. Today’s rally means the Dow has doubled since the depths of the pandemic selloff in March 2020, when it briefly fell below 20,000 points. Over on Wall Street, the main share indices have hit new all-time highs. The Dow Jones industrial average is on the brink of 40,000 points; its currently up 85 points or 0.2% at 39,993. Yesterday’s drop in US inflation continues to cheer investors, who are hoping the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year – perhaps twice or more. A majority of City economists believe the Bank of England will make its first cut to UK interest rates since 2020 in August, although a significant minority think it could act in June. A poll of 71 City experts conducted this week by Reuters found that 38 predicted the BoE will lower Bank rate to 5%, from 5.25%. at its meeting in the first week of August. But 31 opted for the BoE’s next meeting, in June, while two thought it would wait until September. Bank rate is currently a 16-year high; last week, the BoE left borrowing costs unchanged, but governor Andrew Bailey hinted that rates could be cut faster than the markets expect. Back in the City, BT’s shares are on track for their best day on record after the company announced a new cost-cutting drive and lifted its dividend. BT’s shares are up 16% at 131p, which would be the biggest jump in at least 20 years. That’s a blow to the speculators who have been short-selling BT in recent weeks, as it’s shares are now the highest since last December. A number of short sellers took positions in the group after its shares plummeted by 45% over the last five years, from 208p in May 2019 to as low as 105p this year. BT’s new chief executive Allison Kirkby has declared that: “I always love to squeeze the shorts . . . and prove them wrong” (the FT reports). Social media influencers should take note of the charges brought against several reality TV stars by the FCA today, says Sushil Kuner, financial services regulatory lawyer at law firm Gowling WLG. This action follows hot on the heels of the FCA’s recently published guidance on financial promotions on social media which warned influencers who promote financial products or services without having those promotions approved by an FCA authorised person that they may be committing a criminal offence. This action demonstrates the FCA’s commitment to protect consumers from potentially harmful promotions made by influencers who often have significant followers and reach. Social media influencers should take note of this clear warning from the FCA that it will take action where it sees them unlawfully promoting financial products and services, with criminal prosecution being a real threat. After jumping last week, the number of Americans seeking unemployment support has dropped back. There were 222,000 fresh ‘initial claims’ for jobless help last week (to 11 May), the US Department of Labor has reported, down from 232,000 in the previous seven days. The DOL reports that in the previous week: The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 4 were in New York (+10,171), California (+3,595), Indiana (+2,367), Illinois (+1,836), and Texas (+1,253), while the largest decreases were in Iowa (-1,177), New Hampshire (-435), Connecticut (-334), Louisiana (-213), and Kentucky (-208). It’s a sign that US firms are holding onto workers, despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to suppress demand and price rises by raising interest rates. However, there is an increase in people receiving at least two week’s unemployment support. The number of continuing claims jumped by 13,000 to 1,794,000, up from 1,781,000, which suggests it’s becoming harder to find a job… Bank of England policymaker Megan Greene has said this lunchtime that the persistence of inflation has weakened since last summer. In a speech to manufacturers body Make UK, Greene says the Bank’s “restrictive stance of policy” – raising interest rates to a 16-year high of 5.25% – is partly responsible for inflation persistence waning since she joined the Monetary Policy Committee last July. Greene adds that there is uncertainty about how much inflation persistence indeed persists. For interest rates to start to fall, she adds, inflation persistence must continue to wane, so she wants to see evidence that this is happening before voting to cut rates. UK CPI inflation is expected to fall to near the Bank’s 2% target next Wednesday, down from 3.2% last month. Greene speech is mainly about “excess labour hoarding” – where companies hold onto workers even though they don’t have enough work for them. Labour hoarding helps explain why unemployment has remained lower than expected given weak growth and why wage growth has remained stubbornly high, she tells Make UK. And Greene fears it poses “a two-sided risk” to the Bank’s outlook. One possibility is that companies decide they can’t pass on higher costs to consumers, so lay off some workers – pushing unemployment higher than forecasst. Alternatively, if household consumption picks up, firms may decide they have pricing power again and pass through higher costs to consumers, buoying inflation more than the BoE is currently forecasting. The charges announced today against reality TV stars for allegedly promoting an unauthorised trading scheme show the dangers of researching financial products and investments online, says Laura Suter, director of personal finance at AJ Bell. Too many people blindly trust anything they see on social media, but throw in a well-known celeb or a reality TV star endorsing a product and people are even more likely to trust a post. This isn’t a huge problem if you buy some dodgy beauty products or sign up to a duff subscription, but if you put your life savings into an investment because someone from the TV said they made impressive returns, that could be life changing. The regulator had already fired the warning shot to so-called ‘finfluencers’, telling them that they were cracking down on misleading social media posts. While the FCA didn’t introduce any new rules or penalties for those who post misleading content, it tweaked the guidance to give more examples of when social media posts will be compliant or not. But now it’s clearly ramping up its campaign to keep finfluencers in line – this high-profile case no doubt intended to send a message to other influencers. With a maximum penalty of up to two years in prison and an unlimited fine for breaking the rules, there’s no doubt it will make people sit up and listen. Britain’s secretary of state for business, Kemi Badenoch, will meet the CEO of Royal Mail’s parent company International Distributions Services today to discuss Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský takeover offer. A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told reporters that: [Badenoch] is meeting the chief executive officer of Royal Mail’s parent company to discuss this and other matters.” The meeting comes a day after Křetínský increased his offer for IDS to £3.5bn – a proposal which IDS’s board said it was ‘minded to accept’ if Křetínský makes a formal bid. Keith Williams, the IDS chair, yesterday called Křetínský’s new offer “fair”, adding that he had agreed to “protect employees’ current rights and continue to recognise the existing unions”. The Guardian’s financial editor, Nils Pratley, wrote last night that almost every aspect of Křetínský’s fresh offer is unsatisfactory, from the price, to the identity of the bidder and the sketchy “undertakings” to protect the UK postal service. Nils explained: Williams is rolling over just as the government and Ofcom, the regulator, are conducting a review that could, possibly, deliver economic sustainability for Royal Mail in the form of a reduced second-class service. Nobody imagines regulatory nirvana, but £300m of cost-savings, as Royal Mail’s proposal has it, would clearly improve the medium-term financial profile. It is why the superficially huge 73% premium to the pre-offer share price of 214p is not quite as it seems. Second, the bidder here is almost the definition of problematic. Křetínský is a billionaire whose approach to clear and open communication has earned him the nickname “the Czech Sphinx”. In his last UK newspaper interview, he seemed to indicate to the Sunday Times a year ago that he would not bid for IDS. Nils adds that both the government and the opposition Labour party must take a position over the ownership of Royal Mail, from a national interest and foreign ownership point of view. More here. Another key question is whether GLS, IDS’s very profitable Amsterdam-based parcel business, could be formally separated under Křetínský’s ownership. That would leave Royal Mail, currently loss-making, without the financial support from GLS. Activists have disrupted Lloyds Banking Group’s annual shareholder meeting in Glasgow today, Reuters reports, protesting against its alleged provision of financial services to defence firms linked to violence in the Middle East. Lloyds chairman Robin Budenberg requested the removal of at least two activists at the outset of the meeting, pleading with the protestors to reserve their questions until later in the proceedings. Activists have in recent weeks targeted British banks including Barclays’ annual shareholder gatherings, to protest the lenders’ alleged indirect involvement in the Gaza conflict. Barclays said it did not invest its own money in companies that supply weapons used by Israel in Gaza, and it only trades shares in such companies on behalf of clients Press Association have more details: A female protester could be heard referring to Lloyds “funding genocide in Gaza” and “funding climate catastrophe”. “Everywhere you look, you can see it happening,” the protester added, referring to “wildfires and floods” before being removed by security guards. Other attendees shouted: “Oh, shut up” and appeared to want to get involved, with Sir Robin asking them to leave the removal of the protesters to the stewards. Newsflash: Britain’s financial watchdog has brought charges against several reality TV star ‘finfluencers’ over an unauthorised foreign exchange trading scheme promoted on social media. The Financial Conduct Authority says seven influencers promoted the unauthorised trading scheme on their Instagram accounts. The list includes Lauren Goodger and Yazmin Oukhellou of The Only Way is Essex, Rebecca Gormley, Biggs Chris, Jamie Clayton and Eva Zapico of Love Island, and Scott Timlin of Geordie Shore. The FCA has charged an individual named Emmanuel Nwanze with running an unauthorised investment scheme and issuing unauthorised financial promotions. The FCA claims that between 19 May 2018 and 13 April 2021, Nwanze and Holly Thompson used an Instagram account (@holly_fxtrends) to provide advice on buying and selling contracts for difference (CFDs), which they were not authorised to do so. CFDs are a kind of derivative contracts which allow people to trade in the price movement of securities and derivatives. Goodger, Gormley, Chris, Clayton, Zapico, Oukhellou and Timlin are accused of promoting the @holly_fxtrends Instagram account to their Instagram followers. They, and Thompson, face one count of unauthorised communications of financial promotions under Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Collectively, the nine have 4.5 million Instagram followers. The defendants will appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 13 June 2024. The FCA are encouraging anyone who believes they have suffered loss in relation to this matter to contact its consumer contact centre on 0800 111 6768. Newsflash: The European Commission has launched an investigation into the owner of Facebook and Instagram over concerns the platforms are creating addictive behaviour among children and damaging mental health. The EU executive said Meta may have breached the Digital Services Act, a landmark law that makes digital companies large and small liable for disinformation, shopping scams and child abuse. “Today we open formal proceedings against Meta,” the EU commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, said in a statement. “We are not convinced that it has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations to mitigate the risks of negative effects to the physical and mental health of young Europeans on its platforms Facebook and Instagram.” The Commission’s investigation will explore potential addictive effects of the platforms, so-called rabbit hole effects where an algorithm feeds young people negative content, such as on body image. It will also look at the effectiveness of Meta’ age verification tools and privacy for minors. Breton added: “We are sparing no effort to protect our children.” Last month, the European Commission opened formal investigation proceedings into Meta over its handling of political content, including a suspected Russian influence campaign. Denmark has hiked its growth forecasts for 2024, thanks to the strong demand for pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk’s weight loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. Bloomberg has the details: Denmark’s government now predicts the economy will expand 2.7% this year, almost double the rate it previously estimated, accelerated by the Scandinavian country’s flourishing . The economy ministry raised its 2024 gross domestic product growth forecast from a December estimate of 1.4%. In 2025, GDP is forecast to rise 1.8%, up from 1% seen previously. Pharmaceuticals and raw material extraction, including the reopening of the Tyra North Sea gas field, will be key drivers of economic growth, the ministry said in its spring economic review. Without these two industries, Denmark’s GDP would grow just 1.6% this year, and 1% in 2025. Earlier this month Novo Nordisk raised its profit forecast for this year, and is spending billions to expand its manufacturing capacity. The ECB have three concerns about the large number of elections this year. They create uncertainty around global economic policies They also create increased uncertainty around future borrowing needs, given different tax and spend policies between rival parties. They increase the risk of fiscal targets being missed, as incumbent governments try to woo voters with sweeteners such as tax cuts Geopolitical tensions and a busy slate of elections around the world pose risks to financial stability, the European Central Bank has warned. In its latest Financial Stability Review, the ECB cautions that financial markets are vulnerable to sudden shifts in sentiment. And while risks of a deep recession have declined, geopolitical risks are on the rise, it says. Luis de Guindos, vice-president of the ECB, explains that geopolitical tensions are a “significant source of risk” for both euro area and global financial stability. De Guindos says: Policy uncertainty remains high around the world in a year featuring so many major elections. In such an environment, the scope for adverse economic and financial surprises is elevated, and the risk outlook for euro area financial stability remains fragile accordingly. 2024 is certainly a bumper year for elections, with more than 40% of the world’s population heading to polling stations this year, including in the US, India and (probably) the UK. But, De Guindos also points out that financial stability conditions have improved since the last edition of the Financial Stability Review was published six months ago. The near-term risk of a deep recession accompanied by rising unemployment – a major source of concern six months ago – is much lower from today’s perspective, and disinflation has proceeded in parallel. The Review points out that financial markets – currenty at record highs – are priced for perfection, creating a risk of an outsized reaction to any shocks. A group of business leaders have warned Rishi Sunak that the government’s migration policies risk weakening the UK university sector, the Financial Times reports, undermining a key reason for companies to invest in the country. The FT explains: In a letter to Rishi Sunak, bosses at groups including miners Anglo American and Rio Tinto and industrial conglomerate Siemens, said they were “deeply concerned” by widening funding gaps and declining international student applications that were “a result of government policy”. They said this risked “undermining the positive impact that international students have on our skills base, future workforce, and international influence”, as well as reducing the funding available for research and industry collaboration. The intervention by business leaders came as ministers were urged not to abolish the graduate visa programme by the independent Migration Advisory Committee, which advises the government on migration, in its review of the proposal. The government has been considering whether to axe the scheme, which allows foreign students to live and work in the UK for up to two years after graduation, amid fears it is being misused as a backdoor entry route and pressure from the right flank of the Conservative party. More here: UK migration policy risks undermining university sector, business warns Last week, senior Tories warned that ministers should not proceed with a new “self-defeating” clampdown on international student visas, fearing it would hurt the economic recovery and plunge universities into greater financial distress. Sunak, though, is keen to show he’s taking action to reduce migration: Japan’s failure to grow for the last nine months is raising concerns that it could be heading into a out of stagflation, rather than the positive growth cycle which policymakers have been aiming for. Taro Saito, head of economic research at NLI Research Institute, says: Japan’s economy is stagflationary. There’s barely any growth and inflation is running high. After a long period of deflation, prices in Japan are finally rising again. Core CPI inflation was 2.6% in the year to March, which wiped out most of the benefits of the biggest wage rises in three decades from Japanese companies. Elsewhere in the water industry, United Utilities has said it expects financial penalties due to flooding problems last year. United Utilities, which reportedly pumped millions of litres of raw sewage into lake Windermere earlier this year, has reported profit after tax of £127m for the year to 31 March. The utility, based in the north-west of England, is proposing to raise its dividend by 9.4%, having being ranked as the most polluting water firm in England earlier this year. It has made a pretax profit of £220.5m for the last financial year, up from a £34.3m loss, with operating profits rising 17%. It reports that it received an ODI (outcome delivery incentive) reward of £34m from the regulator Ofwat, its highest ever. Those ODIs are bonuses which are granted for exceeding services targets. But it also warned that “exceptionally high rainfall” during the year adversely impacted performance such as flooding, meaning United expects to receive penalties from Ofwat against its ODIs. Louise Beardmore, chief executive officer, says the company “take our role in protecting the environment very seriously”. It is bringing forward £400m of investment to reduce spills at more than 150 storm overflows, and to accelerate environmental schemes in communities such as Windermere. The City is not pleased to see Johan Lundgren leaving easyJet, though. EasyJet’s shares are down 6% in early trading, as traders react to the change in the company’s cockpit. That’s despite the company predicting a record second half of its financial year (April-September, when summer trading boosts earnings). Lundgren (who should be at easyJet until 1 January 2025) explained this morning: We are now absolutely focused on another record summer which is expected to deliver strong FY24 earnings growth and are on track to achieve our medium term targets. There are “clear signs of progress” at BT, reports Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Costs associated with the fibre buildout look to be at their peak, and that’s vitally important as telecom giants continue to be punished for investing heavily in the future. Once that spending comes down, free cash flow should jump higher, and markets can reassess how to price these businesses. Progress on getting costs in check also looks promising, with the £3bn programme completing early, and another £3bn targeted by the end of the decade. That’s helped give CEO Allison Kirkby the confidence to put out a strong free cash flow guide for the coming year. Shares in BT have jumped by over 8% at the start of trading in London. Investors seem cheered by Allison Kirkby’s new cost-savings drive, the 3.9% hike in the dividend announced today, the goal of growing free cash flow, and her pledge that BT has reached “the inflection point” on its long-term strategy. BT’s shares have risen to 122p, the highest since early January, wiping out almost all their losses for this year. That will sting the investors who have placed a £300m bet against the telco by shorting its shares (borrowing them, and selling them, in the hope of buying them back more cheaply). EasyJet’s CEO is stepping down, after a gruelling seven years in which he handled the Covid-19 disrupion and soaring oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. The budget airline has annnounced that chief executive Johan Lundgren will leave the company at the start of next year. CFO Kenton Jarvis has been appointed as his successor. EasyJet has also reported that its losses narrowed in the last six months, to £347m in the half-year to 31 March from £411m a year earlier. The company says it is on track to deliver its “ambitious medium term target” of pre-tax profits over £1bn. Lundgren will be a loss, says Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin. explaining: EasyJet continues to reduce losses during the quieter winter period, while summer bookings are strong. Greater airline capacity, increased revenue from ancillary services, and the growth of easyJet Holidays are adding to the spread of revenue sources and giving customers a better connection to the brand. Johan Lundgren has navigated a particularly turbulent period for easyJet in the last seven years and his departure will be a loss to the company. But, he leaves the airline in a strong position and there are clear succession plans in place, providing a good deal of stability for easyJet as it continues on its upward trajectory. While the shares have rallied since October 2023, they remain some way off their pre-pandemic peak – so there is still plenty of room for growth. Thames Water’s largest shareholder has withdrawn its representative from the utility’s board, as the uncertainty over the debt-laden utility company’s future continues. Thames told the City this morning that Michael McNicholas, a representative of the giant Canadian pension fund Omers, is stepping down with immediate effect. Thames’ board members have been in a tricky position since its owners pulled the plug on £500m of emergency funding in late March, and indicated that they were unprepared to stump up more funds to invest in Thames’s infrastructure. The company’s investors – a consortium of funds from Canada, Abu Dhabi, Australia, Britain and China – had deemed the company “uninvestible”, arguing that the industry regulator, Ofwat, had been too stringent. The FT says McNicholas’s departure is a further sign that Thames’s owners “are prepared to ditch their stake in the UK’s biggest water company”. UK telecoms group BT has announced a new cost savings push to save £3bn per year, after reporting a drop in profits. BT’s new CEO, Allison Kirkby, says the group is now aiming to make £3bn of gross annualised cost savings by the end of its 2029 financial year. That’s on top of an existing £3bn cost savings and service transformation programme, which costs jobs, and which BT reports has been competed a year early. Kirkby reports that BT has now reached “the inflection point” on its long-term strategy, having passed the peak spending point of its full-fibre broadband rollout. She is now announcing new financial guidance, including doubling BT’s free cash flow over the next five years. The company is also lifting its dividend by 3.9% this year, to 8p a share. Kirkby says: BT Group built and connected customers to our next generation networks at record speed and efficiency over the past year, while continuing to grow revenue and EBITDA. Having passed peak capex on our full fibre broadband rollout and achieved our £3 billion cost and service transformation programme a year ahead of schedule, we’ve now reached the inflection point on our long-term strategy. Kirkby is under pressure from sceptical investors, who have taken out short positions worth £300m against BT’s share price. This morning, the company also reported a 31% drop in pre-tax profits for the last financial year, to £1.186bn from £1,729bn. That’s despite BT raising prices; average revenue per user for its Openreach broadband division grew by 10%, partly due to price rises and increased volumes. But it lost 491,000 Openreach broadband customers, a decline of 2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Japan’s economy has made a weak start to 2024, shrinking faster than expected, and confirming the UK as the joint fastest-growing G7 country this year. Japan’s GDP contracted at an annualised rate of 2% in January-March, compared to October-December, worse than the 1.5% drop in activity forecast. That works out as a 0.5% quarterly drop in activity, as households and companies cut back. Weak consumer spending dragged on growth as did a fall in capital spending and net exports. There are temporary factors to blame – including a New Year’s Day earthquake near Tokyo in which more than 200 people died, and a safety scandal at carmaker Daihatsu which disrupted production. But in another blow for Tokyo, data for the fourth quarter of last year was revised down to show GDP was flat. That means nine months with no growth, since Japan’s economy slumped last summer. This 0.5% contraction in January-March puts Japan at the bottom of the G7 growth league. We already know that the UK expanded by 0.6% in Q1, ahead of the US with 0.4% growth and Italy with 0.3%, while Germany and France both expanded by 0.2%. Official Q1 data for Canada isn’t out yet, but it’s estimated to have expanded by 0.6%. Japan’s weak growth is a headache for the Bank of Japan, as it tries to normalise monetary policy after running a massive stimulus programme. Predictions that the BoJ will struggle to raise interest rates have hurt the yen against the US dollar in recent weeks. Fortunately for the BoJ, though, the dollar is weakening after yesterday’s drop in US inflation.

        "title": "The chancellor should ditch the NatWest retail share offer. It’s not needed | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "The government’s plan to sell shares in NatWest to the general public is so advanced that the odds on the chancellor pulling the plug on a pet project are slim. Investment bankers from Barclays and Goldman Sachs are doing their well-remunerated stuff, and M&amp;C Saatchi is knocking up some adverts. The go-ahead for a rah-rah pre-election retail share offer is expected any week now. In a rational world, though, Jeremy Hunt would call the whole thing off. He already has a tried-and-tested method for disposing of the state’s NatWest shares and – this is the point – it is working splendidly. Look at the pace at which the Treasury in recent months has been able to shift shares in the former Royal Bank of Scotland, 84% nationalised in 2008, by simply selling them on the stock market. At the end of the last year, the government’s stake was 38%. It dipped below 30% in March, allowing the Treasury to crow about no longer being considered a “controlling shareholder”. This week the holding, worth £7.66bn, went just under 27%. An 11% stake has been sold in just five months. It has happened quietly because that’s how the NatWest “trading plan”, adopted in 2021, is meant to operate. Shares are dribbled into the market with the aim of not disturbing the underlying price and thereby getting full value for the public purse on the day. Amid the general stock market rally this year, conditions have been near perfect. The Treasury has been selling at ever-higher prices and NatWest’s shares have improved from 218p at new year to 326p. Why mess with this winning formula? In a retail offer, brokers suggest a 10% discount would be needed to entice punters, probably in the form of loyalty bonus for those who keep their shares a year. So, if the offer were as large as £3bn, which seems to be the ambition, the Treasury could be giving away £300m of value versus the market price at the time. That is not small change. Here’s the Treasury’s rationale from March: “A retail sale could not only help achieve the goal of exiting the NatWest shareholding, but also help support wider government priorities on our ambitious financial services agenda, including promoting retail investing and the UK’s capital markets.” On the first goal – getting the state rid of NatWest altogether – it is obviously true that flogging a big slug of shares in one go would speed things up. But the government’s deadline for a full exit is spring 2026 and the trading plan, involving no discounts, looks capable of delivering ahead of time. That’s even before one counts “directed buy-backs” in which the government sells shares to NatWest itself. The bank, flush with capital these days, said last month it has capacity to buy a 5% stake this year. So we’re down to the “wider government priorities”, meaning the idea that a sale to the public would do wonders for share ownership in the UK. Would it, though? Unlike the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s, anyone can buy shares in NatWest today. The main reason to participate in a retail offer would be because the government is selling below market price to people able to write a cheque for a couple of grand at short notice. That is not a pure message about the virtues of long-term investing. Hunt would do better to shout about his new British Isa, the success of auto-enrolment and so on. Or tell the City to give retail investors access to stock market flotations. Or, to make a proper splash, cut stamp duty on share purchases. At the time of the 2023 autumn statement, when Hunt first mentioned a retail offer, there was a stronger case for it. NatWest’s shares were becalmed and outside investors were fretting about the bank’s relations with government after the Coutts/Nigel Farage fiasco. The Treasury’s 39% stake at the time was acting as a drag. A retail offer had some merit as a way to reset the mood. But today’s picture is different. NatWest has a new chairman and chief executive and the shares stand at their highest level since 2015. The surest sign the market is regarding NatWest as a “normal” bank is that its valuation is well above reported net asset value. Now that the state’s stake is falling fast in orderly fashion, the dynamic has changed. NatWest/RBS was nationalised on behalf of all of us. We reconciled ourselves long ago to the fact that the 502p “in” price from 2008 was over the horizon. But the duty to maximise value at disposal, which Hunt sometimes remembers to mention, should mean something. There is no need for a flashy retail offer in which public money slips between the cracks. Stick to the trading plan.",

        "title": "Royal Mail reform will not take place before general election, says Ofcom",
        "content": "A shake-up of the postal service that could hand the owner of Royal Mail a £300m boost will not take place before the general election, it has emerged, as the company’s bosses meet ministers to discuss its proposed £3.5bn takeover by a Czech billionaire. The industry regulator, Ofcom, has been studying options to reform the universal service obligation (USO), which requires Royal Mail to deliver nationwide, six days a week. Ofcom has said an update to the process, which could result in the regulator allowing the struggling company to cut back its service, is due this summer. However, the Guardian understands that Ofcom does not expect to implement any reforms until after the forthcoming general election, which could take place as late as January, and possibly not until the second half of 2025. The communications watchdog’s work has taken on extra importance since the emergence of takeover interest in Royal Mail’s owner, International Distributions Services (IDS), from its largest shareholder, the Czech energy tycoon Daniel Křetínský. On Wednesday, the IDS board backed a 370p-a-share bid from Křetínský’s EP Group. The lengthy timetable for the reform process represents a blow for Martin Seidenberg, the chief executive of IDS, who recently called on regulators to begin consulting on recommendations as early as this summer in an investor presentation. “Reform is in the regulator’s hands and we urge Ofcom to accelerate their review,” the company said. Earlier this year, Ofcom laid out options for change, including reducing the service to as little as three days a week. In response, Royal Mail asked to be allowed to water down its second-class mail service so that it only has to deliver every other weekday, saving £300m and cutting nearly 1,000 jobs. A source close to Ofcom’s work said: “It is possible to do what Royal Mail wants without changing legislation – making the process quicker – but the election makes the timing very difficult to do anything this side of Christmas. “There has been a huge response to the original call for input. There will be a brief update in July summarising the responses and giving an update, but full recommendations will not come before an election, particularly given purdah [the restriction on civil servants’ activities before an election].” It is understood full recommendations are likely to be followed by a three-month consultation, and then a further gap until their implementation. Royal Mail wants to make its network more efficient as it struggles to deliver on time amid falling letter volumes and stiff competition on parcels. An industry source said: “Regulators do not want to allow Royal Mail to degrade the service by allowing it to slow down, without getting better quality of service.” Křetínský’s £3.5bn bid, improved from an earlier £3.1bn offer, has given added significance to a long-planned meeting between Seidenberg and the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, on Thursday. Sources said the pair had planned to discuss the potential USO reforms, but the bid will now also be on the agenda. Ahead of the meeting, Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson said the government “will engage at the relevant point in the process to outline our expectations”, adding that regulators would also be involved. When backing Křetínský’s offer, IDS also said EP Group had agreed to “undertakings”, including keeping the brand and maintaining a service delivering first-class letters six days a week. The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has written to Křetínský, who is also a part owner of West Ham United, to commit to “safeguards” if the deal is completed, including maintaining the universal service and keeping the company’s headquarters in the UK. Royal Mail, which was privatised in 2013, lost £319m in the first half of its financial year and IDS will report group annual results next week. Late last month, the credit analysis firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet rated the company as at “high risk of severe financial stress”. Ofcom said: “We have received thousands of responses to our call for evidence on the future of the universal postal service. We’re now examining these carefully before finalising our next steps. We’d like to thank all those who have contributed to the national debate on this important issue, and we’ll be providing an update on this work in the summer.”",

        "title": "United Utilities raises investor payouts a day after Windermere sewage discharge revealed",
        "content": "One of Britain’s most polluting water companies has increased its payouts to shareholders by nearly 10% in the same week that it emerged it had pumped raw sewage into Windermere in the Lake District for 10 hours. United Utilities will pay its investors – which include some of the world’s biggest asset managers – £339m in dividends for this year, up from £310m for 2023, after it reported higher operating profits thanks to a rise in customer bills. The water company, which serves 7 million customers across north-west England, said its annual revenues had risen by about 8% to almost £2bn last year, mainly driven by a higher revenue cap, which was reset by the regulator to take account of inflation. United Utilities’ dividend windfall will flow to funds managed by major institutional investors, which include US finance giants Lazard Asset Management, Vanguard Group and BlackRock, as well as Legal &amp; General Investment Management. The water company reported the shareholder windfall after it was revealed on Wednesday that millions of litres of raw sewage had been illegally pumped into England’s biggest lake earlier this year. United Utilities reportedly failed to stop illegal pollution of Windermere, in the Lake District, for 10 hours in February. The company did not report the incident to the Environment Agency until 13 hours after it started, according to a BBC investigation. The BBC cited United Utilities documents it had obtained that revealed that a telecoms fault on the night of 28 February had caused the main pumps at United’s Bowness-on-Windermere facility to stop. A set of emergency pumps then discharged untreated sewage into Windermere, which is part of a Unesco world heritage site. The company said the incident had been reported “within an hour of the pollution being confirmed” and as soon as the fault had been discovered its engineers “took urgent steps to resolve the situation”. In March, official figures indicated that last year nearly a third of United Utilities’ storm overflows had discharged raw sewage 60 times or more – the threshold for an Environment Agency investigation. Louise Beardmore, the company’s chief executive, said United Utilities had been ranked as the No 1 water and sewerage company for customer service in the independent UK Customer Service Index. “We take our role in protecting the environment very seriously; our ambitious business plan would see us investing more than ever before to improve services across the five counties of the north-west,” she said. “This would deliver a genuine step-change in infrastructure for the benefit of customers and the environment, and support 30,000 jobs.”",

        "title": "BT reveals £3bn cuts as it passes peak full-fibre broadband spend",
        "content": "BT has disclosed a further £3bn of cost-cutting measure as the telecoms group signalled it had passed peak investment in the rollout of its UK full-fibre broadband network and raised its dividend. Allison Kirkby, who took over as chief executive this year, said the company had reached an “inflection point” in its strategy, as she faces pressure to revive the flagging group. A number of short sellers had taken positions in the group after its shares plummeted by 45% over the last five years, from 208p in May 2019 to as low as 105p this year. Announcing its full-year results, BT said it would target a further £3bn gross annualised cost savings by the end of 2029 after hitting its existing cost-savings target early. The group had already announced cuts of up to 42% of the company’s 130,000-strong workforce by the end of the decade. Kirkby said that despite the cost-cutting plan, there was “no change” to the company’s current jobs reduction target. Last May, BT said it would reduce its workforce by as much as 55,000 by 2030, from 130,000 at the time to 75,000-90,000. The cuts are expected to include about 10,000 jobs being replaced by artificial intelligence. Shares rose 17% to 132p on Thursday, making it the top FTSE riser on the day. “I always love to squeeze the short [sellers] … and prove them wrong,” Kirkby told the Financial Times. BT indicated improved cashflow going forward following peak capital expenditure for its fibre network rollout, and raised its dividend for the year to March 2024 by 4% to 8p a share. Pre-tax profits fell by 31% to £1.1bn for the year, down from £1.7bn in the previous year after BT took a large impairment charge. BT is facing tough competition from scores of alternative network providers, or “alt nets”, as it rolls out next-generation 5G mobile and full-fibre broadband through its Openreach subsidiary across the UK. The company has set itself a £15bn plan to roll out high-speed broadband to 25m homes by 2026 and said it had now laid fibre to more than 14m premises, with a further 6m where initial build is under way, and is on track to reach 25m by December 2026. However, the company said it continued to lose Openreach broadband customers with line losses of 491,000 in the year, a 2% decline in the broadband base due to weaker than expected growth. BT has a 74% share of broadband lines in the UK and had expected to lose customers each year but had also expected to pick up business from new homes being built. “Last year housebuilding was minimal and broadband saw a slight decline because of the consumer squeeze,” Kirkby said. Its business division, which serves small businesses and public-sector clients, continued to struggle with a 2% fall in revenue. Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “BT is growing … slowly. Credit where it’s due, there are clear signs of progress here. Costs associated with the fibre buildout look to be at their peak, and that’s vitally important as telecom giants continue to be punished for investing heavily in the future. Once that spending comes down, free cashflow should jump higher, and markets can reassess how to price these businesses.” However, he said the business division “continues to be the problem child” and noted that BT had to write down the value of the asset to the tune of nearly £500m.",

        "title": "EasyJet’s Johan Lundgren to step down at beginning of 2025",
        "content": "EasyJet’s chief executive, Johan Lundgren, will step down at the beginning of next year after seven years at the helm of the budget airline. The carrier is promoting its chief financial officer, Kenton Jarvis, to take his place, with Lundgren to hand over the reins on 1 January 2025. The outgoing boss will stay with the business until mid-May as part of the airline’s “orderly succession plan”. Lundgren has had an eventful tenure. He became CEO of easyJet at the end of 2017, after serving as second in command at the rival travel firm Tui, and has more than 30 years of experience in the travel industry. His leadership was put to the test two years into his term when pandemic lockdowns grounded plans and put airlines under severe financial strain. It resulted in staff layoffs, and later rehiring as air travel started to recover. Stephen Hester, the chair, said on Thursday: “We are sad that Johan will retire from easyJet. He has done an excellent job as our CEO since December 2017; steering the company through the immense challenges of the Covid period, and setting up a clear strategy and strong execution plan towards its ambition of ‘being Europe’s most loved airline, winning for customers, shareholders and our people’. “There is good positive momentum and Johan will be with us to close out the current year, which we hope will be another one of strong progress.” Lundgren told journalists during a media call that he did not have set plans for life after easyJet, but that he was not planning to defect to another airline. “No, I’m not going to do anything else [in] aviation, I can promise you that.” Jarvis will take over after three years as easyJet’s CFO, and will get a notable pay rise. His £542,000 annual salary will increase to £800,000, compared with the £770,000 that Lundgren received in 2023. EasyJet said the rest of Jarvis’s pay package would be structured “in line with its existing policy” for its chief executive, putting him in line for similar payouts to those handed to Lundgren last year. EasyJet paid Lundgren a total of £2.2m in 2023, which included a £1.3m bonus, £48,000 cash in lieu of pension, and £50,000 to cover benefits such as life insurance and travel costs. Before easyJet, Jarvis worked in a number of roles at Tui, including chief executive of its airline division. Previously he worked at the accounting firm PwC, Airtours Holidays, and held finance roles at the sports group Adidas. The incoming boss is unlikely to shake up the business. “I’ve been on the board of easyJet for over three years now and have been an active part of co-creating … the current strategy. So I’m 100% committed to the current strategy and also very confident in our ability to deliver on the medium-term targets,” he said. Details of the planned change at the top came as the group reported a pre-tax loss of £347m for the six months to 31 March, narrowed from losses of £415m a year ago. Lundgren said: “We have continued to focus on productivity, on growth, and we are pleased to see that we have reduced winter losses by £61m year on year. This result was despite the conflict in the Middle East, which increased fuel costs and impacted demand to the region.” EasyJet shares were down 6.5% on Thursday at 494p, making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100.",

        "title": "‘It’s going gangbusters!’ How Britain fell in love with bubble tea",
        "content": "On a sunny Thursday afternoon, the Covent Garden branch of Gong cha is doing a roaring trade. Staff behind the counter are busy preparing drinks for a string of customers, all ordering from an electronic pad in the corner. One leaves with a purple concoction flavoured with the root vegetable taro; another sips on a milky tea laced with brown sugar “pearls”. A third grabs a bright drink tasting of passion fruit and adorned with floating coconut jelly. It’s a scene being played out more and more as bubble tea shops like Gong cha pop up around the UK. Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, has just got its first (called Just Poppin); in Canterbury, Kent, there are six shops to choose from; and a new branch of American bubble tea brand CoCo recently had dozens of people queueing down Glasgow’s Bath Street. Alongside the specialists, high-street stalwarts are also turning their attention to the drink. After dipping its toe in the water last year, Costa Coffee has put three bubble tea frappés on its summer menu (in addition to the two more-conventional versions it sells under “iced teas”), while supermarkets have added DIY kits to their shelves. After decades of bubbling under the surface, this intriguing drink appears to be getting its time in the spotlight. The exact origin of bubble tea (or boba tea, as it’s also commonly known) is disputed – but all of the stories take us back to Taiwan, and usually to the 1980s. It’s widely agreed that the first iteration was a shaken iced tea with an added fruit flavouring, and that it was named after the froth that floated on the top. At some point, someone had the bright idea of adding round pearls of tapioca (a starch that comes from the roots of the cassava plant and was already popular in desserts) to the mix. Typically sinking to the bottom, these are the “boba” of boba tea – the word means “balls” in Cantonese. It may seem extraordinary to anyone who can remember being dished up tapioca pudding – AKA frogspawn – at school, but the combination of refreshing milky tea, sugar and these slightly chewy little orbs proved a hit. Taiwan’s consumers embraced the drink and there are tens of thousands of boba outlets in the country today. China boasts hundreds of thousands, and the drink has made millionaires (even billionaires) out of some of the big chains’ founders. “It took a while for it to go to the western world,” says Assad Khan, the CEO of UK brand Bubbleology. “It started in some of the major Chinatowns in big cities.” After tasting the drink in New York, Assad launched his first shop in Soho, London, in 2011 – a stone’s throw from the capital’s Chinatown. Bubbleology now has 42 outlets, 33 of them in the UK. Alongside it, other new independent names have also set up shop, as have retailers from Taiwan and China. One reason for the growth, says Paul Reynish, global CEO at Gong cha, is that “there’s a reasonably low barrier to entry. You don’t need much to run a bubble tea shop, although that depends on your quality credentials.” His chain, which he says prides itself on its use of a good, “single garden” tea as a base for its drinks, originated in Taiwan in 1996 and now has more than 2,100 branches around the world. In the UK, it has new or imminently opening branches in Bristol and Norwich and, later in the year, a Belfast outlet will follow. “Most of the growth has come in the last five years,” Reynish says. “It’s going gangbusters.” “Early adopters are Asian because they have grown up with it, but very quickly they bring their friends and that cohort is quite diverse,” Reynish says. The drinks are most popular among young female consumers. “Young girls seem to be the real growth in the market – 10- to 20-year-olds,” says Tim Lai, whose family runs Taipec, a company supplying bubble tea shops around the UK. Their interest has been driven by who they have seen drinking it – stars of K-pop and social media – says Zoia Tarasova, a behavioural analyst at consumer insights agency Canvas8. “Many of these celebrities and social media influencers endorse bubble tea on popular platforms such as TikTok,” she says. Young people also have a “general openness to tasting diverse new food and drink flavours inspired by foreign cultural traditions. “Once favoured exclusively by east Asian diaspora communities in the US and the UK, this tea is also establishing itself as a new favourite with young people with no personal connection to this region,” she adds. In fact, young people with a connection to the place where bubble tea was born may not recognise some of the drinks that pass for it in the UK. Alongside the traditional tapioca infused with brown sugar, you can now often select toppings such as fruit tapioca, jelly pieces flavoured like coconut or fruits, custard or grass jellies, or popping boba filled with fruit juice or syrup. Bubbleology’s menu, Khan explains, has been customised to cater for the UK market. “In Asia you will find most bubble tea stores are heavily dominated by milk tea with tapioca,” he says. “We sell more popping boba than we do tapioca.” Lai, whose parents came from Taiwan, says popping bubbles are his company’s bestseller too. “If you were to show that to Taiwanese people they’d think we’d mutilated bubble tea,” he says. When I visit the Covent Garden Gong cha, Vidam, 21, and a friend are buying drinks. He says he first had bubble tea seven years ago and didn’t like it much, but tried it again about three years ago and has now become a fan. He even has a store loyalty card. His friend, who does not want to be named, is from Malaysia and says she had her first bubble tea as a child. “It’s a big part of the culture where I grew up. I tried it when I was really young. I don’t remember life without bubble tea.” Today, however, she is having an iced tea, because the bubble tea on offer here is too sweet. “I think it’s a little worse than in Malaysia. People here prefer sweeter flavours.” Vidam suggests that “the quality of the pearls is different, too”. Sweetness really is a point of difference in the UK. Costa’s blueberry burst bubble tea, for instance, has 119 calories in a 408ml serving, and a sizeable 26g of sugar – that’s more than in its lemonade or standard serving of hot chocolate. When I ask Lai about his favourite bubble tea, he says he doesn’t often drink it “because it’s so sugary”. But Reynish says that it doesn’t have to be high in sugar, as most of his shops offer the choice to reduce the sweetness of the drink – at Gong cha you can opt for different levels, including 0%. The customisable nature of bubble tea is a big part of its appeal, says Lai. “If a group of 10 friends go into a bubble tea shop they can all have something different. They can go back five times and across 10 friends not have the same drink twice.” Sugar aside, the teas also tend towards ethically unsound disposable packaging, with many shops putting a plastic seal over the top before shaking the drink. But Assad says Bubbleology will launch reusable cups in the summer (and incentivise customers to use one), and some brands have introduced paper tops. Most are transporting ingredients from Taiwan, though, which raises its own questions regarding carbon emissions. These drinks are not cheap, either. While the £5 flat white only recently hove into view, bubble teas have been hovering around that mark for some time. But that does not seem to be putting customers off. Analysts suggest that the bubble tea market was worth $2.46bn last year and will near $5bn by 2032. That’s still a tiny fraction of the global coffee market, but heavily suggests that many, many more people will soon discover the joy of tapioca-adorned drinks. Khan believes this to be true. He says it’s an impulse purchase, but compared with other impulse buys it is still relatively unknown to much of the public. “If I was to say to someone, ‘Have you tried ice-cream?’ they will say, ‘Yes.’ If I say to someone, ‘Have you tried doughnuts?’ they will say, ‘Yes.’ If I asked about bubble tea, I would guarantee the majority of people would say, ‘No.’ Until we get to that point [where they say, ‘Yes’] it’s not a mature market.” He believes bubble tea could follow a similar trajectory in the UK to sushi. “We are very early in the growth cycle,” he says. Starbucks has just launched three bubble tea drinks in North America but says it so far has no plans to do so in the UK. McDonald’s offers it in Hong Kong, but not elsewhere. Reynish at Gong cha says the chain is “underpenetrated in the UK”. There are plans to change that. Last summer, Bubbleology launched make-at-home bubble tea kits, which are now on sale at retailers including Morrisons, Tesco and Asda. Assad likes to imagine these kits sitting in UK cupboards alongside more traditional tea and coffee. Elsewhere, John Lewis recently added a bubble tea kit to its gift range. Tan Heng Hong, a senior food and drink analyst at global market research agency Mintel, says Europe and North America now account for 41% of launches in the ready-to-drink, boba-based tea market. “We expect the next growth phase for boba in western markets will be in dairy and ice-cream,” he says. “In Malaysia, for example, Nestlé launched a boba brown sugar ice-cream that combines chewy boba and indulgent brown sugar sauce.” Jane Wynn and her eight-year-old daughter Rose, from Ystrad Mynach in south Wales, fell in love with bubble tea in 2022 when they visited a shop in Cardiff. “After Covid, it was nice to just go out and do something different,” she says. “I used to work with a colleague from Thailand who joked she lived on noodles and bubble tea, so when we saw a shop we went and tried it.” There are now at least bubble tea six shops in Cardiff (including a branch of Bubbleology), but Jane says their favourite outlet is Honey Dots in Bargoed, a town four miles north of Ystrad Mynach. Rose says that she and her older brother Carter, 13, “love how the boba pearls pop. My favourite is probably passion fruit and strawberry pearls.” Jane explains that while her children also like the coconut jelly, she finds it “a slightly odd texture” and tends to go for the traditional brown sugar teas. “It’s nice that you can customise them,” she says. They opt for 50% of the standard sweetness although, she adds, “I’m sure that’s probably about 50 teaspoons of sugar.” They’ll have it instead of a dessert if they’re out, or as a treat. “The only thing for us is that they are so expensive,” she says. “If the three of us go out for one it’s easily £20.” After we speak, Jane gets in touch with some big news: a new bubble tea shop is opening in their own little town. The boba bubble, it seems, isn’t bursting any time soon. • This article was amended on 22 May 2024. An earlier version misspelled the name of the Mintel analyst Tan Heng Hong.",

        "title": "Sharp rise in cost of British lamb in UK due to rising demand and import issues",
        "content": "The price of British lamb has hit an all-time high as cold weather and disease in the UK and difficulties with imports have combined with a surge in demand. Wholesale prices have soared by more than 40% year-on-year to more than £8.50 a kg , while the amount of lamb expected to be produced in the UK this year is forecast to shrink by 1.4%, according to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB). Meanwhile, UK demand in the past three months is up by 8% after Easter and Eid, when families tend to make lamb a centrepiece dish. British supermarkets also face competition for local lamb from overseas buyers, with high demand in France. David Swales, head of economic analysis at the AHDB, said that after 14 years at the agricultural body he had “never known a market like this”. He said lamb prices had risen so high that te group had been force to adjust its usual graphs. “There is a perfect storm of issues coming together to create that market,” he said. Cold and wet weather is thought to have led to more lambs dying in the early season, while there are fears about the impact of a wave of the deadly Schmallenberg virus in the south of England, Wales and the Midlands, Swales said. The rising cost of British lamb comes as the price of its main competitor, New Zealand lamb, has fallen by about a fifth year-on-year to less than £3 a kg after a glut of Australian lamb on global markets and weak orders from China. Lamb from Australia and New Zealand is also able to be sold more cheaply in the UK as a result of new trade deals which remove tariffs on a greater quantity of meat. However, imports have not risen as sharply as expected, with attacks by Yemen-based militants on Red Sea cargo ships delaying shipments. The rapidly changing market has prompted Morrisons, the UK’s fifth-largest supermarket which is thought to buy more than 10% of British lamb, to drop a seven-year commitment to selling 100% British lamb. Morrisons said it would “trial” selling New Zealand lamb in 39 stores later this week. Industry experts said that other supermarkets with similar promises are likely to come under pressure to change. However, Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer and the Co-op all said they had no plans to ditch their commitments to 100% British lamb. “The trial follows an extensive exercise listening to customers who were very clear that they want us to sell lamb at a more accessible price all year round,” said a Morrisons spokesperson. “The blunt commercial reality is that New Zealand lamb is cheaper to source, and therefore cheaper to sell, than British lamb. “We will remain 100% British lamb on all our butchers’ counters, and the New Zealand lamb will of course be clearly labelled so customers in these trial stores will see the difference and can make a choice. “We do not intend this move to mean a reduction in the overall volumes of lamb that we buy directly from British farmers.” The NFU said it had written to the boss of Morrisons and other top retailers in April to secure a commitment to local sourcing in a move to maintain food production and safeguard security. Its livestock board chair, David Barton, said that this was all the more disappointing because homegrown lamb would likely be replaced by products from overseas, such as Australia and New Zealand with significant food miles and produced to potentially lower standards. But a spokesman for Beef and Lamb New Zealand, which represents beef and sheep farmers in New Zealand, said this was not the case: “New Zealand farmers strongly reject claims by the National Farmers’ Union of England that New Zealand lamb is produced to a lower standard nor the assertion that food miles is a significant factor in the footprint of NZ lamb.” Phil Stocker, the chief executive of the UK National Sheep Association (NSA), said the timing of the announcement alongside Rishi Sunak’s Farm to Fork Summit, an event designed to show support for UK agriculture, was “quite unbelievable”. He added: “This is a very poor decision, and something NSA warned could happen during the negotiations around the new trade deals agreed with Australia and New Zealand last year.” • This article was amended on 31 May 2024 to add a response from Beef and Lamb New Zealand.",

        "title": "Australia’s unemployment rate rises to 4.1% reducing chance of another RBA interest rate hike",
        "content": "Australia’s jobless rate rose more than expected last month as more people looked for work, easing risks of another Reserve Bank rate hike. The unemployment rate in April was 4.1%, seasonally adjusted, compared with a revised 3.9% for March, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. Economists had predicted the jobless rate would edge higher for a third consecutive month to 3.9%. The economy added a net 38,500 positions with full-time roles down 6,100 while part-time positions rose 44,600. Economists had forecast employers would add 23,700 jobs in April. The participation rate – a measure of those looking for work – ticked higher to 66.7% last month. Economists had expected it would hold steady at 66.6%. Hours worked, meanwhile, were little changed for the month. The labour market can be volatile, such as February’s shock 116,500 jobs increase. The federal government’s budget this week predicted the unemployment rate would be 4.25% by June and 4.5% a year later. The RBA, which sets its cash rate according to its own forecasts for employment and inflation, earlier this month predicted the jobless rate would be 4% by June, then 4.2% by year’s end and 4.3% in June 2025. The government has forecast inflation would be back to the RBA’s target 2-3% band by December, a result that would increase the chances of a cut in interest rates and eliminate the risk of a 14th rate increase in this cycle. The jobless rate was also 4.1% in January. Before then the last time the unemployment figure was this high was in January 2022. Investors said the labour data suggested another rate rise was less likely – with the dollar easing a tenth of a US cent to about 66.9 US cents. The stock market, where lower interest rates boost many firms’ profits, had a more notable uptick. Already up about 1.4% for the day, the benchmark ASX200 share index increased its advance to about 1.7%. Bjorn Jarvis, ABS’s head of labour statistics, said the economy needed to add about 30,000 jobs a month to keep the jobless rate steady given population increases. “The employment-to-population ratio remained steady at 64% in April, indicating that recent employment growth is broadly keeping pace with population growth,” Jarvis said. “This suggests that the labour market remains tight, though less tight than late 2022 and early 2023.” The timing of Easter – falling entirely within April – could also factor in the results. “In contrast to what we saw last year, when fewer people than usual took time off around the Easter holidays in April 2023, the proportion of people working reduced hours in April 2024 was more similar to what we saw before the Covid-19 pandemic,” Jarvis said. All states and territories posted a rise in the unemployment rate except Queensland, which remained steady at 4.1%. NSW’s rate was up to 4% from 3.8%, Victoria rose to 4.2% from 4.1% and Western Australia jumped to 3.9% from 3.4%. The ACT, which had the lowest jobless rate at 2.9% in March, saw its figure pick up to 3.8%, still the lowest in the nation.",

        "content": "Marks &amp; Spencer is teaming up with a recycling technology group to enable the retailer to trace what happens to its drinks bottles, cartons and other plastic packaging. The Polytag system prints an invisible tag on to containers, which can be picked up by electronic readers located at recycling centres. Products featuring the tags will begin appearing on shelves in the next three months. Different aspects of the system have been tested with The Co-op, Aldi and Ocado, the online grocery specialist which has also invested in Polytag, but this will be the first full-scale use of the scheme. As part of the project, M&amp;S will also fund the installation of two readers at recycling sites in Northern Ireland and Edmonton, north London, which will add to two existing sites on Teesside and one in north Wales. The Welsh government is also funding the installation of readers at a further three recycling centres in the country. In a year’s time, Polytag is aiming to have more than 12 sites that will account for half of all the single-use plastic household waste recycled in the UK, as it expects to sign up additional retailers who will fund the installation of further readers at recycling centres. It is hoping to increase that to 48 UK sites covering 95% of household waste recycling. The project launches as retailers prepare to pay new fees towards the disposal of plastic packaging next year under the government’s delayed extended producer responsibility (EPR) regime. Retailers are already bound to monitor and report the amount of packaging they sell and future fees are expected to be based on those measures. The retail industry has called for the money raised by the EPR scheme to go towards building better recycling infrastructure in the UK so that materials can be reused locally. Alice Rackley, the chief executive of Polytag, which is based in Deeside, near Chester, said the system would aid the sorting of plastic pots and bottles so that items that once contained food, which are worth more than those contaminated with household chemicals such as bleach, could be separated out more easily. “There is a massive single-use plastic crisis and we have got to start collecting data about it and to use that to try and sort it out,” Rackley said. She added that the ability to show items had been properly recycled might also be used by retailers as a way to demand lower EPR fees. The system will not be able to monitor what happens to products sent overseas or show how many items end up in landfill. However, Rackley said the scheme could be used to check that waste disposal partners were handling plastic in the correct manner.",

        "title": "Czech billionaire’s bid for Royal Mail is problematic from every angle",
        "content": "Almost every aspect of Daniel Křetínský’s fresh offer for the owner of the Royal Mail is unsatisfactory: the price, the identity of the bidder and the sketchy “undertakings” to protect the UK postal service. First, the terms – 370p a share, or £3.5bn – only look attractive if you think the government, or the next one, will maintain the current blinkered stance of refusing to reform Royal Mail’s six-day-a-week delivery obligations. Even as he issued a “minded to recommend” verdict on the terms, Keith Williams, the chair of International Distributions Services (IDS), the parent company, took a pop at the government’s intransigence on the universal service obligation – and he was right to do so. It should be screamingly obvious that Royal Mail needs some regulatory relief to compensate for the massive decline in letter volumes over the past 15 years. That issue, delayed by a pandemic that briefly yielded bumper profits for Royal Mail, should have been tackled years ago. But therein also lies the weirdness of the timing of this takeover offer and IDS’s backing for it. Williams is rolling over just as the government and Ofcom, the regulator, are conducting a review that could, possibly, deliver economic sustainability for Royal Mail in the form of a reduced second-class service. Nobody imagines regulatory nirvana, but £300m of cost-savings, as Royal Mail’s proposal has it, would clearly improve the medium-term financial profile. It is why the superficially huge 73% premium to the pre-offer share price of 214p is not quite as it seems. Second, the bidder here is almost the definition of problematic. Křetínský is a billionaire whose approach to clear and open communication has earned him the nickname “the Czech Sphinx”. In his last UK newspaper interview, he seemed to indicate to the Sunday Times a year ago that he would not bid for IDS. Many European countries, like the UK, have privatised or part-privatised their postal services, but none has let them pass into private ownership from abroad. The dire example of the water sector is a neon-lit example of the danger of allowing ownership of critical bits of infrastructure – a description that still, just about, fits Royal Mail – to slip out of view. A stock market listing, which guarantees a loose level of accountability to the outside world, is a far better model. Third, the set of “contractual undertakings” that the board of IDS is negotiating with Křetínský are a work in progress, at best, or junk mail at worst. It’s welcome, of course, that Royal Mail’s headquarters would stay in the UK, and that the business would remain tax-resident here. But in the next sentence we learn that “the exact scope and duration” of such pledges haven’t yet been pinned down. Nor is there any mention of whether GLS, the very profitable Amsterdam-based parcel business that is worth far more than Royal Mail, could be formally separated under Křetínský’s ownership. It is a significant issue because it raises the huge question of what financial resources would be given to a standalone Royal Mail, which is currently loss-making. Given that Křetínský’s group owns 30% of the Dutch parcels operator PostNL, one has to assume that the Dutch end of IDS is central to his takeover logic. When he made his initial, and rejected, 320p-a-share offer last month, it seemed possible that this takeover tale could quietly fizzle out. Thus it was easy for government ministers and Labour opponents to squirm and be noncommittal when asked about the national interest and foreign ownership. That is not an option now. This proposal needs maximum scrutiny.",

A trawl through the accounts of 17,000 companies by the trade union Unite found pre-tax profit margins were 30% higher on average in 2022 compared with the average across 2018 and 2019. Post-tax margins were on average 20% higher. The findings are likely to further fuel concerns over widespread profiteering during the inflation crisis – triggered by the reopening of economies after pandemic lockdowns and war in Ukraine – with some businesses using the rising cost of living as an opportunity to increase their margins. Companies of all sizes and from almost all sectors, from banks to shipping firms and veterinary practices, saw pre-tax profit margins rise, even as wages have fallen in real terms and investment has slumped, the analysis shows. “This is why our economy is broken,” said the Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham. “Because of the choices of executives, investors, and politicians who choose short-term profits and fat dividends over investing in our industries and public goods.” Electricity generation companies and big banks have benefited most, the study found. Of the 16,600 companies analysed, 9,651 were shown to have increased their profit margins over the period, or roughly 60%. However, post-tax profit margins in these sectors were tempered by government windfall taxes, introduced to return some of the gains to the taxpayer. The Energy Price Levy increased the windfall tax on energy and gas companies from 25% to 35% in January 2023, while the rise in corporation tax combined with the Bank Levy increased tax on banks from 27% to 28%. The data also includes overseas profits made by UK registered companies, which would not have been inflationary in the UK. Some of the more surprising gains came from medium-sized companies, including veterinary practices and car dealerships. The UK competition watchdog is scrutinising the consolidation of independent vets by private equity-backed corporations, which it says may have contributed to more expensive bills for consumers. Profit margins jumped by 280% at the height of the pandemic for private equity-backed veterinary chains as hundreds of people bought pets to cope with isolation during the lockdowns, the Unite study found. At the six largest vet chains, which control half the market, profits surged to 237% of pre-pandemic levels in 2021 after losses in 2018 and 2019. Until last year, the Bank of England largely attributed inflationary pressures on companies to wage rises at the behest of workers, appealing to employees to forgo higher salaries to help slow down price rises. But a growing body of evidence suggests that persistent high inflation has come in part from companies setting their own prices rather than passing on the benefit of falling costs in the form of price cuts, a process that has been called “greedflation”. Studies by the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank have concluded rising corporate profits are contributing to higher inflation. In September, the Bank of England acknowledged that rising corporate profits were likely preventing a fall in inflation, after it surveyed a small, 2,500-strong sample of the UK’s 5m-plus companies. Unite used a much bigger sample. It added together the sum total of the profits of 16,600 companies, before dividing by the sum total of their turnover. Isabella Weber, an economist from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said central banks responded to profit-led inflation by tightening monetary policy, such as raising interest rates, triggering another round of windfall profits at the expense of ordinary people. Weber said: “Central banks have reacted to sellers’ inflation by hiking interest rates. This has created yet another opportunity for extraordinary profits, since banks reaped higher returns on their assets but did not pass them on to savers. Simply put, the strategy to fight sellers’ inflation and rising unit profits has been to create yet another opportunity for windfall profits.” A separate analysis published on Wednesday shows that over the past 30 years, the UK’s top 350 listed companies have switched from investing surplus funds to distributing it among shareholders. In the second half of the 1970s, private, non-financial corporations paid out 20p dividend payments for every £1 of gross fixed capital formation, a measure of investment, according to the thinktank Common Wealth. By the 2010s, this figure had risen to 95p before hitting 103p in the last five years. A government spokesperson said: “This government is backing our world-leading businesses and these profits are a cause for celebration.”",

        "title": "Royal Mail owner backs £3.5bn takeover offer by Czech billionaire",
        "content": "The owner of Royal Mail has backed a £3.5bn offer for the postal company from a Czech billionaire after he sweetened the value of his planned takeover, creating a political headache for the government. Last month, Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS), rejected a preliminary offer worth 320p a share, or £3.1bn, from Daniel Křetínský, the part-owner of West Ham United whose company, EP Group, is the postal service’s shareholder. However, on Wednesday the group – which also includes the international parcels arm GLS – said it was likely to recommend a higher 370p a share offer to its investors if it was formally lodged. Keith Williams, the IDS chair, said: “The board is minded to recommend this offer price, which it considers to be fair and reflects the value of GLS’s current growth plans and … the progress being made on change at Royal Mail to adapt the business to a significant fall in the demand for letters and growth in parcels.” IDS said its suitor had agreed to “protect employees’ current rights and continue to recognise the existing unions”, as well as keeping the Royal Mail brand and maintaining its headquarters in the UK. Křetínský, known as the Czech Sphinx for his low profile and inscrutable approach, also has stakes in Sainsbury’s, as well as a string of power stations. He already owns a 27.6% stake in IDS. IDS had said Křetínský’s first offer “significantly undervalues” the company. However, its backing for Křetínský’s latest offer creates a headache for the government during a general election year, and amid increased scrutiny of foreign ownership of critical UK infrastructure assets. His interest comes at a crucial juncture for struggling Royal Mail, which hopes the industry regulator, Ofcom, will allow speedy reform of the universal service obligation (USO), which requires the 508-year-old Royal Mail to distribute nationwide for one price, six days a week. IDS said EP had agreed a “set of contractual undertakings to protect key public interest factors and recognise Royal Mail’s status as a key part of national infrastructure”, which it expected the bidder to present to government. This includes honouring a commitment by Royal Mail to offer a service delivering first-class letters six days a week. IDS is pushing to be allowed to cut second-class deliveries to every other weekday. EP would stick with “key elements” of the proposals, IDS said. Rishi Sunak has opposed any cuts to Royal Mail’s obligations. Since Křetínský’s intention to bid emerged, it has been reported he has privately made assurances that he would not make compulsory redundancies, split the group or touch its £1.6bn pension surplus. EP is expected to lay out firm commitments on these areas if it pushes the button on a formal bid. Dave Ward, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: “The current Royal Mail board have grossly mismanaged the company. EP Group must immediately demonstrate an upfront and open commitment to working with the union to completely change the culture in workplaces across the UK, rule out any breakup of the company or raid of the pension surplus.” If a takeover by Křetínský goes ahead, it will be heavily scrutinised by regulators and parliament. In 2022, the government told Royal Mail it would study an increase in Křetínský’s stake under the National Security and Investment Act. However, that investigation was called off later that year. Royal Mail was privatised in 2013 for £3.3bn, despite opposition from workers and complaints by Labour that the coalition government’s sell-off represented a “fire sale of a great British institution”. The takeover will hand a windfall to the thousands of postal workers who were given shares in privatisation and have retained their shares. Shareholders will also receive a special dividend if the deal is completed, worth £76m. Redwheel, the third-largest shareholder in IDS, had backed the rejection of Křetínský’s earlier offer. IDS will publish its annual results on 23 May and, under City takeover rules, Křetínský has until 29 May to make a firm bid. The company’s shares have rallied from 214p before Křetínský’s interest, and rose by 19% to 322p after the improved bid was confirmed on Wednesday.",

        "title": "Wall Street at record high after US inflation falls to 3.4%; takeover offer for Royal Mail raised – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up. Here are today’s main stories: Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and work and pensions secretary Mel Stride have been accused of “gaslighting the British public”, after claiming the unemployed have “ample opportunities” to find a job. Former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke has told MPs that the UK’s inflation shock “was inevitable”, and would have happened even if his recommendations to improve the Bank of England had been implemented. More takeover drama in the City: Oil services company John Wood Group has rejected a second takeover approach. John Wood told shareholders that Dubai-based Sidara has raised its previous offer – which it turned down – by 3% yesterday. However, John Wood’s board has concluded that it continued to fundamentally undervalue Wood and its future prospects, and unanimously rejected it today. Ben Bernanke then explains to MPs that central banks in general made a collective mistake, by thinking supply chain disruption would be swiftly resolved. He tells the Treasury committee: [They thought] the supply chain disruptions would be taken care of relatively quickly by profit-maximising firms, who would finding replacement inputs or alternative ways to make their products. In fact, the supply chain disruptions took a lot longer than most people – including experts in the field – thought would happen. Back in New York, stocks are at record highs after US inflation dropped in April. The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq both hit record highs in early trade on Wednesday, as the fall in US CPI to 3.4% bolsters hopes of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.5% at 39,755 points, closing in on the 40,000 mark…. Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, says: “The Fed can breathe a sigh of relief after today’s CPI. This report alone is insufficient to generate a rate cut at the June or July FOMC meeting, but it lays the groundwork for 25 bps of easing at the September meeting on the back of decelerating shelter and services ex-shelter price pressures.” Britain’s surge in inflation would still have happened even if the Bank of England’s processes had been better, says former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke. He has been asked by the Treasury committee whether the recent painful rise in inflation could have been avoided, if the recommendations made in his new review of the BoE had been implemented a couple of years ago. Bernanke suggests not, pointing out to MPs that the inflation surge was due to global shocks, from the impact of pandemic lockdowns to the Ukraine war – which pushed up oil and food prices and caused supply chain disruption. He explains: Avoiding inflation entirely would have been essentially impossible without throwing the economy into essentially a depression. Significant inflation was unavoidable, and every market economy experienced that. But… Bernanke adds that the MPC might have understood the modelling aspects of the inflation shock better, had his recommendations (which include modernising its software) been implemented. But either way, “significant inflation was inevitable”, he adds. Over in parliament, former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke is briefing MPs about his review of the Bank of England. The Bernanke review, published last month, reported that the BoE’s economic model needed revamping, and that key systems were out of date. Testifying to the Treasury Committee today, Bernanke says he was concerned about some aspects about the Bank’s modelling and the software it uses; it may be possible to improve the use of its economic forecasts. But Bernanke says he was also impressed by many elements of how the Bank worked – including the collaboration between its Monetary Policy Committee and its staff on drawing up those forecasts. The owner of Royal Mail has accepted a £3.5bn bid for the postal company from a Czech billionaire after he ramped up the value of the takeover, creating a political headache for the government. Last month, Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS), rejected a preliminary offer worth 320p a share, or £3.1bn, from Daniel Křetínský, an energy tycoon whose company, EP Group, is its largest shareholder. However, on Wednesday IDS said it was recommending an improved 370p a share offer to its investors. More here. Today’s increased offer for Royal Mail came just a few hours before the deadline for Daniel Křetínský to either make a firm bid, or walk away. And having raised the value of his proposal to £3.5bn, the PUSU (put-up or shut up) deadline has been extended by two weeks, to 5pm on 29 May 2024. Shares in IDS have jumped to a two-year high, after the company announced that Daniel Křetínský has raised his takeover offer to £3.5bn. They’re up 20% at 325p per share, the highest since May 2022. That’s still some way short of Křetínský’s offer, which is worth 370p per share in total. Today’s new offer is a 72.7% premium to IDS’s share price on 16 April, the day before his first offer was revealed. Keith Williams, chairman of IDS plc, has criticised the government, as he explains why Royal Mail’s parent company is minded to recommend Daniel Křetínský’s new £3.5bn takeover proposal: “The Board is minded to recommend this offer price, which it considers to be fair and reflects the value of GLS’ current growth plans and the progress being made on change at Royal Mail to adapt the business to a significant fall in the demand for letters and growth in parcels. “It is however regrettable that despite four years of asking, the Government has not seen fit to engage in reform of the Universal Service and thus improve our financial position and ensure that Royal Mail could provide an economically sustainable service to the British public. “The Board believes that the proposed contractual undertakings to be offered by EP Group should ensure that IDS continues to deliver the key elements of the Universal Service in the UK and protect the interests of the workforce at both Royal Mail and GLS.” IDS adds that “There can be no certainty that any offer will be made”… Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský has raised its takeover offer for Royal Mail. Křetínskýs investment vehicle, EP Group, is now offering to pay around £3.5bn for Royal Mail’s parent company International Distributions Services. That’s an increase on last month’s offer, of £3bn. Kretinsky’s new offer is worth 370p per IDS share – 360p per share in cash, plus a 2p dividend and an 8p special dividend. Kretinsky currently owns around 27.6% of IDS’ issued share capital. IDS’s board say they have indicated to EP Group that it would be minded to recommend the offer to IDS shareholders, should it be formally made. IDS adds that it has sought “a set of contractual undertakings to protect key public interest factors and recognise Royal Mail’s status as a key part of national infrastructure”, which EP Group has agreed to offer. The slowdown in US inflation appears to be lifting confidence that British interest rates could be cut soon. The money markets now indicate that a June cut to UK interest rates is now a 58% chance, up from about 50% last night. Back in the UK, a clutch of directors are reportedly ready to resign from the board of Thames Water’s owner, as the uncertainty over the debt-laden utility company’s future continues. A number of board members of Kemble Water Finance, the ultimate parent of Thames Water, are poised to quite in the coming days, Sky News reported. The directors have looked to be in a difficult position since Thames’s owners pulled the plug on £500m of emergency funding in late March, and indicated that they were unprepared to stump up more funds to invest in Thames’s infrastructure. The company’s investors – a consortium of funds from Canada, Abu Dhabi, Australia, Britain and China – had deemed the company “uninvestible”, arguing that the industry regulator, Ofwat, had been too stringent. Kemble then defaulted on a debt interest payment last month. Thames could ultimately fall into a special administration, effectively a temporary nationalisation by the government to ensure service is maintained for the company’s 16 million customers. Ofwat’s draft view of English and Welsh water companies’ five-year business plans, due next month, is seen as a crucial moment in determining the immediate future of Thames Water. U.S. retail sales were unexpectedly flat in April, in a sign that American consumer spending is weakening. Economists had expected a 0.4% rise, month-on-month, in retail sales – but new data shows that spending was “virtually unchanged”, and 3% higher than a year ago. The report shows that spending on gasoline was up 3.1% month-on-month, and 4% higher than a year ago. That suggests higher gasoline prices ate into consumers’ pockets, leaving less to spend elsewhere. Spending at motor vehicle &amp; parts dealers fell by 0.8% in the month, with spending at furniture stores down 0.5%. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, says: “The usual excitement over US inflation ended up being a damp squib, as it came in exactly as expected. However, retail sales were weaker than expected and the core rate is back to levels not seen for quite some time, which might well see optimists calling for rate cuts and markets rallying.” Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says the financial markets wil be reassured by the drop in US inflation last month. However, Flynn doesn’t believe it will prompt the Federal Reserve to rush to lower interest rates. “Today’s figures show that the rate of inflation has fallen, compared to last month. Although this will offer reassurance to markets after an unwelcome uptick in CPI figures last month, the figures are unlikely to prompt an imminent change in interest rates. Patience has been the Fed’s core message lately. Officials have been fairly consistent in stating that current interest rates are sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation under control and that the next move will be a cut. However, it is also clear that they are in no rush to make that move. Whether we see rates reduced in July, September, or December will depend on how inflation changes in the coming months, how the economy performs, and whether any issues arise in the financial system or jobs market. In the meantime, we watch and wait.” The US dollar is weakening, as April’s inflation report lifts hopes that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. The greenback has dropped to a one-month low against a basket of other major currencies: This has pushed the pound up by half a cent, to $1.2645, the highest since 10 April. The euro has climbed to its highest level against the dollar in a month too, at $1.086. Traders are cheered that US inflation rose by less than expected during April alone. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.4% on the month – but in the event, it only rose by 0.3%. US energy prices rose by 2.6% in the year to April, today’s CPI report shows. Food prices rose by 2.2% over the last year, including a 4.1% increase in ‘food away from home’ (ie, eating out at restaurants). Core US inflation also eased last month. The all items less food and energy index rose by 3.6% over the 12 months to April, today’s inflation report shows, down from 3.8% in the year to March. On a monthly basis, core inflation slowed to 0.3% in April alone, having risen by 0.4% in the preceeding three months. The inflation report adds: Indexes which increased in April include shelter, motor vehicle insurance, medical care, apparel, and personal care. The indexes for used cars and trucks, household furnishings and operations, and new vehicles were among those that decreased over the month. Newsflash: Inflation across the US has slowed, bringing some relief to American families and perhaps reassuring America’s central bankers that price pressures are easing. The consumer price index rose by 3.4% in the year to April, down from 3.5% in March. That’s in line with Wall Street forecasts. In April alone, prices rose by 0.3%, a slowdown on March when they increased by 0.4%. Rising costs of housing, and fuel, were both key factors behind inflation last month. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says: The index for shelter rose in April, as did the index for gasoline. Combined, these two indexes contributed over seventy percent of the monthly increase in the index for all items. The energy index rose 1.1 percent over the month. The food index was unchanged in April. The food at home index declined 0.2 percent, while the food away from home index rose 0.3 percent over the month. Back in the UK, digger maker JCB, owned by the billionaire Bamford family, continued to build and supply equipment for the Russian market months after saying it had stopped exports because of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the Guardian can reveal. Russian customs records show that JCB, whose owners are major donors to the Conservative party, continued to make new products available for Russian dealers well after 2 March 2022, when the company publicly stated that it had “voluntarily paused exports” to Russia. The data raises questions about the accuracy of JCB’s statements on its business in Russia and relationship with its biggest dealer there, Moscow-based Lonmadi, and that company’s former owner, UK-based JVM group. JCB has repeatedly said that it stopped exporting products to Russia and JVM companies after 2 March 2022 – less than a week after Putin sent troops into Ukraine. However, customs records collated by a trade data provider show the serial numbers of dozens of vehicles, worth millions of pounds, which appear to have been supplied to companies in Russia after that date. When the Guardian presented a sample of those records to the Staffordshire-based manufacturer, it admitted that JVM continued to collect diggers from JCB’s factories for months after the voluntary pause, but said that was due to contractual obligations. JCB also confirmed that the manufacturing of some of the equipment continued after that date. JCB’s lawyers said: “Any collection of goods by a JVM company after 2 March 2022 was pursuant to contractual obligations already entered into and completed or substantially completed prior to that date.” The company also denied any inconsistency or inaccuracy in its public statements. More here: Most Wall Street banks are expecting a small drop in US inflation today, with many expecting CPI to slow to around 3.4% from 3.5% in March. Tensionis rising in the financial markets as global investors await the latest US inflation report, due in 30 minutes time. As covered in the introduction, economists are expecting a slight slowdown in the rising cost of living. The US CPI inflation rate is forecast to slow to 3.4% for April, down from 3.5% in the year to March. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, is forecast to slow to 3.6%, which would be the lowest level in three years, from 3.8% in March. Traders are very keen to see signs that price pressures are easing, having driven global stock markets to record highs today (see here) on hopes that a slowdown in inflation will allow interest rates to be cut this year. Jens Magnusson, chief economist at SEB, says there is cautious optimism for a slight decline in core inflation, but also nervousness in the markets. Magnusson explains: For three months in a row, we have had US inflation disappointments. Combined with continued strong growth and an almost overheated labour market, this has led to a dramatic shift in the view of the Fed and the possibility of US interest rate cuts. At the beginning of the year, market pricing was leaning towards as many as seven interest rate cuts in 2024; now the expectation is a maximum of two. Many experts are asking if today’s figures confirm inflation is stuck at too high levels or will they provide hope, that Q1 was a temporary delay on the road to a permanently lower inflation. There’s another shake-up at artificial intelligence pioneer OpenAI. Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s co-founder and chief scientist, has left the artificial intelligence start-up, six months after the turmoil that saw CEO Sam Altman fired and rehired amid a staff revolt. Sutskever has posted that he will now work on “a project that is very personally meaningful to me about which I will share details in due time”. Sutskever was a crucial part of OpenAi’s growth – the company was valued at $80bn earlier this year, and launched a powerful new chatbot model this week. Altman has posted that Sutskever’s departure is “very sad” news. Sutskever will be succeeded by Jakub Pachocki as OpenAI’s new chief scientist; Altman described Pachocki as “also easily one of the greatest minds of our generation”. Jan Leike, another senior researcher at OpenAI, has also announced his departure from OpenAI, posting “I resigned” on X. Leike had been the co-lead of OpenAI’s superalignment group, which worked on ensuring that AI systems act in the human interest if/when they surpass human-level intelligence. The Bank of England has fired a warning shot at UK banks and building societies after an 18-month review of more than 70 lenders found firms were ill-prepared for a severe shock that could put their finances at risk. A letter sent by the Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority to CEOs and board members this morning said firms had failed to create severe enough stress tests and as a result, did not have sufficient recovery plans. The letter warned: “Our review found that a number of firms did not use scenarios of sufficient severity, which will limit the effectiveness and value of the testing.” It added that: “...although many firms understand the basics of recovery planning, there are significant areas for improvement, most notably related to the development of recovery scenarios and the calculation of recovery capacity.” The thematic review is the first of this scale conducted by the PRA, and covered unnamed non-systemic banks (so that includes smaller challengers, beyond the big lenders like NatWest, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, the UK arm of Santander, Nationwide building society and Virgin Money UK that are stress tested every year). The PRA said it would now be pushing firms to improve their stress testing and recovery plans over the next six months. “We will engage collectively with firms and trade associations as appropriate to discuss the findings of this letter in 2024 H2 and we will include this as a topic for discussion at the June CEOs conference. Firms are expected to consider the actions outlined above and update their recovery plans to meet expectations.” The International Energy Agency (IEA) has cut its forecast for oil demand growth this year, due to weakening demand. The Paris-based energy watchdog has lowered its growth outlook for 2024 by 140,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.1 million bpd, largely citing weak demand in developed OECD nations. In its latest monthly report, the IEA says that “weak deliveries, notably in Europe” pushed demand across the OECD into contraction in the first quarter of this year. It says: Poor industrial activity and another mild winter have sapped gasoil consumption this year, particularly in Europe where a declining share of diesel cars in the fleet were already undercutting consumption. The IEA adds that the health of global oil demand will probably be “a key topic for discussion” when OPEC+ ministers meet in Vienna on 1 June. The European Commission has warned that external economic risks to Europe’s economy have risen in recent months, due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Gaza conflict. In its new spring forecasts, the EC says that risks originating from outside the EU have increased in recent months amid “two ongoing wars in our neighbourhood and mounting geopolitical tensions”. It says: Global trade and energy markets appear particularly vulnerable. Moreover, persistence of inflation in the US may further delay rate cuts in the US, but also beyond, resulting in somewhat tighter global financial conditions. On the domestic front, EU Central Banks may also postpone rate cuts until the decline in services inflation firms The EC also says that Europe’s economy staged a comeback at the start of the year, following a prolonged period of stagnation, with growth of 0.3% in the last quarter (see previous post). It is sticking with its forecast that the eurozone will grow by 0.8% this year, but trimmed its forecast for growth in 2025 to 1.4%, slightly lower than the 1.5% predicted in February. But it has also lowered its inflation forecasts. Eurozone inflation, which averaged 5.4% last year, is forecast to slow to 2.5% this year, and then 2.1% in 2025 – virtually back to the European Central Bank’s target. Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, says: The EU economy perked up markedly in the first quarter, indicating that we have turned a corner after a very challenging 2023. We expect a gradual acceleration in growth over the course of this year and next, as private consumption is supported by declining inflation, recovering purchasing power and continued employment growth. But, Gentolini adds, “downside risks have increased” as “two wars continuing to rage not far from home”. Just in: We have confirmation that the eurozone escaped recession at the start of this year, but not as briskly as the UK managed. Data provider Eurostat has reported that eurozone GDP rose by 0.3% in the January-March quarter, in line with its flash estimate last month. That follows two quarters in which the eurozone shrank by 0.1%, which put it in a technical recession. Among major eurozone economies, Germany avoided recession by growing by 0.2% in Q1 2024, a growth rate matched by France, while Spain grew by 0.7 and Italy by 0.3%. The UK expanded by 0.6% in the January-March quarter, beating both the eurozone and the US which grew by 0.4%. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and work and pensions secretary Mel Stride have been accused of “gaslighting the British public”, after claiming the unemployed have “ample opportunities” to find a job. Hunt and Stride have written in the Times today that there’s no reason to be stuck on benefits. The ministers wrote: “We’ve been clear that unemployment benefits should only be there as a safety net, not a lifestyle choice. With around 900,000 vacancies in the economy there are ample opportunities for people to get on and get ahead in the world of work.” Their comments come after the UK unemployment rate yesterday rose to 4.3% in the first quarter of this year, with the number of people out of work and looking for a job rising by 166,000 to 1,486m. The number of vacancies fell to 898,000 and company payrolls shrank. The number of people ‘economically inactive’ jumped to almost 9.4m, due to more people becoming temporarily sick, long-term sick, or retiring. The rise in sickness has been blamed on the long waits for treatment on the NHS, which prevent people getting back to work. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak says the government should focus on bringing down NHS waiting lists, rather than “punching down” by suggesting unemployment is a lifestyle choice. Nowak tells us: “Ministers are gaslighting the British public on the state of the UK labour market. “Unemployment shot up by over 160,000 over the last quarter and record numbers of people are becoming economically inactive because they are too sick to work. “Instead of punching down, the Tories should be tackling our sky-high waiting lists and improving access to treatment. “And they should be laser-focused on improving the quality of work in this country. “People need jobs they can build a live on. But under the Conservatives we have seen an explosion of low-paid and insecure work that has led to eye-watering levels of in-work poverty. “Before handing out lectures, Jeremy Hunt and Mel Stride should try surviving on a zero-hours contract.” Stephen Evans, chief executive at Learning and Work Institute, agrees that it’s wrong to suggest there is a widespread sicknote culture, or that unemployment benefits are a lifestyle choice for many. Evans explains that more needs to be done to help people improve their skills, and access to the jobs market, saying: “Many people who are out of work want to work, including 1.7 million who are economically inactive. But only one in ten out-of-work disabled people get help to find work each year and many people can’t find work that fits with caring responsibilities or health conditions. It’s wrong to suggest that unemployment benefits are a lifestyle choice for many or that there’s a widespread sicknote culture. Rather, there’s not enough support to improve skills or find work and employers need to look at job design and terms and conditions to attract potential workers.” In their Times article, Hunt and Stride write that the UK economy is doing “far better than many would have you believe”, after it emerged from recession last week, though they do concede there have been “bumps, twists and turns” in the economic recovery. Jobs are there if unemployed want them, ministers insist The London stock market received a boost this morning, with low-cost computing pioneer Raspberry Pi announcing it is considering floating here. The Cambridge-based maker of low-cost computers, designed to help children learn to code, announced it is considering an initial public offering in London. Eben Upton, CEO of Raspberry Pi, told the City: “When we released our first product in 2012, our goal was to provide a computer that was affordable enough for young people to own and explore with confidence, giving them the chance to discover computing and get excited about it. But from the very beginning we saw customers using our products in a staggering variety of applications across a broad swathe of markets, and as we recognised the potential for affordable technology to make a meaningful difference not just in education but in countless other contexts, the scale of our ambition grew. Twelve years later, we have sold over 60 million units in over 70 countries around the world. Raspberry Pi really is a UK tech success story; created with the idea of providing a cheap, but powerful computer that made it easier to understand how computers worked. The FT reports that the company hopes to seek a market valuation of about $630m (£500m). If Raspberry Pi’s float does come off, it would show that the LSE can still attract companies, and help address the lack of exciting tech companies here in London. Lorries carrying perishable food and plants from the EU are being held for up to 20 hours at the UK’s busiest Brexit border post as failures with the government’s IT systems delay imports entering Britain, my colleague Jack Simpson reports. Businesses have described the government’s new border control checks as a “disaster” after IT outages led to lorries carrying meat, cheese and cut flowers being held for long periods, reducing the shelf life of their goods and prompting retailers to reject some orders. The worst disruption was last weekend, with dozens of lorries being held at the government’s control post serving Dover and the Channel tunnel for periods of between eight and 20 hours after the IT system that registers goods went down. More here. Here’s Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, on today’s rallying stock markets: “European markets are trading higher - the FTSE 100 is leading the gains up over 0.5% hitting a fresh record high lifted by Experian which has surged 8% thanks to a strong annual revenue forecast. Meanwhile weak full-year results from Burberry have dragged the luxury stock to the bottom of the blue-chip index. Anglo American [yesterday] announced plans to demerge its 85% stake in De Beers after it rejected a sweetened takeover offer from rival BHP, saying the £34 billion bid was ‘highly unattractive’ for shareholders. Both stocks are trading higher. Global equities are on a tear – the MSCI All Country World Index closed at a record high last night and the US tech-heavy Nasdaq also hit a record closing high last night. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has also hit a record high in early trading. Germany’s Merck are up 4%, after posting better-than-expected adjusted earnings, helped by strong demand for its pharmaceuticals, and sales growth in its semiconductor materials. It’s done it again! The UK’s blue-chip share index has climbed to a new record high in early trading. The FTSE 100 index jumped around 0.5% to a new intraday high of 8474 points, as investors hope that US inflation will fall today. Experian, the credit data firm, are the top riser – up over 8% after it reported growth at “the top end of our expectations” for the last financial year. In the City, profits at Burberry have dropped by 40% as the luxury goods market continues to struggle. Burberry’s profits fell to £383m in the 12 months to the end of March, down from £634m a year earlier. Revenues fell 4%, while profit margins also shrank. Burberry reports that men’s and women’s ready-to-wear clothes sales were below average, but outerwear – such as its Heritage raincoats - were strong, while there was a double-digit increase in sales of scarves. Jonathan Akeroyd, Burberry’s CEO, says that “executing our plan against a backdrop of slowing luxury demand has been challenging”, adding: While our FY24 financial results underperformed our original expectations, we have made good progress refocusing our brand image, evolving our product and strengthening distribution while delivering operational improvements. Back in January, Burberry issued a profit warning after weak Christmas trading. And looking ahead today, Burberry cautions that the first half of the current financial year is expected to “remain challenging”. It reports that sales in the Americas fell 12% last year. Sales in mainland China fell by 19% in the last quarter, but were up 2% over the year. Sarah Riding, retail &amp; supply chain partner at law firm Gowling WLG, says the retail market in general is “under the kosh at the moment”, adding: “While Burberry’s results highlight a significant global reduction in sales and the subsequent fragility of the luxury market at present, there are still plenty of opportunities for those that have the supply chain ingenuity and ability to deliver against specific customer requirements in this space. “Burberry has a proven track where this dynamic is concerned, given its aptitude in splitting its offering to suit key demographics that span demand for more obvious Burberry-led branding applies, while providing more subtle focused designs within its other lines – for example Thomas Burberry - thus, helping meet the need for quality and less obvious brand association at the same time Global stock markets have climbed to a new record high today, ahead of the US inflation data due at 1.30pm UK time. The MSCI All Country World Index, which tracks equities around the globe, nudged up to a new peak this morning, having closed at a record high last night. That suggests optimism that today’s inflation report will show that underlying US inflation moderated last month. Last night, the US tech-focused Nasdaq index closed at a record high; it’s gained around 10% so far this year. There was also another flurry of meme stock excitement yesterday, with Gamestop surging 60%. The UK’s stock market has helped with this rally – with the FTSE 100 hitting a series of record highs in recent weeks. The Footsie is up 9% since the start of January. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank reports that the markets turned more upbeat yesterday, telling clients: The S&amp;P 500 (+0.48%) closing within two tenths of a percent of its all-time high on March 28. Tech stocks outperformed, with the Magnificent 7 (+1.01%) reaching a new all-time high, led by Tesla (+3.29%) and Nvidia (+1.06%). But the equity rally was broad-based, with the small-cap Russell 2000 up +1.14%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Hopes that America’s economy will achieve a ‘soft landing’ will be tested today by the latest US inflation data. Investors across the globe are poised for April’s US CPI report, hoping to see signs that inflationary pressures are easing. But there’s also anxiety that price pressures are sticky, making it harder for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates soon. Economists predict the annual US inflation rate will dip to 3.4% for April, after jumping unexpectedly to 3.5% in March. On a monthly basis, prices are expected to have risen by 0.3%, a slowdown on March’s 0.4%. Yesterday, Fed chair Jerome Powell pointed out that inflation has been falling more slowly than expected, despite US interest rates being raised to their highest in over two decades. Powell told a conference in Amsterdam: “We did not expect this to be a smooth road. But these [inflation readings] were higher than I think anybody expected. “What that has told us is that we’ll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work.” Investors are keenly awaiting the inflation data to gain a clearer understanding of when and to what extent the Fed might adjust interest rates, explains Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com. Razaqzada adds: Persistent inflation in the first quarter, coupled with hawkish sentiments expressed by Fed officials advocating for prolonged high interest rates, have bolstered the US dollar. However, recent developments such as weaker-than-anticipated US non-farm payrolls and an increase in jobless claims have fuelled speculation that the Fed might initiate interest rate cuts as early as September. Core inflation, a key measure of underlying price trends, is forecast to slow to 3.6% per year, down from 3.8%. Yesterday, we learned that US producers raised the prices by 0.5% in April, a faster increase than expected – but Wall Street shrugged that off, seemingly hopeful that today’s Consumer Price Inflation report will show prices easing. The dollar has dropped to a one-month low against the euro this morning, ahead of the CPI data.

        "content": "Remember all that talk about wage-price spirals? About wages driving inflation? All that worry about a wages breakout causing interest rates to rise? Ahh yes, good times. It seems that many commentators and economists love fairytales, and the story that wages were causing inflation was never true and the figures released on Wednesday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show just how much of a struggle it is for wages to keep up with inflation. In December annual wage growth hit 4.2% – the fastest since 2009. Such strong growth brought with it the usual suggestions that wages were growing too fast and the Reserve Bank would be ready to hit the interest rates brakes. Well, relax. The March quarter figures show annual growth of 4.1% and all signs are that 4.2% was the peak. If the graph does not display click here Some of the commentary surrounding the budget has been that the government has different economic predictions than the RBA’s. The jury is still out on who will be most accurate on their predictions of inflation but, on wage growth, the government looks likely to win the prize. The RBA estimated that by June wage growth would be 4.1% while the government has predicted 4.0%. Wage growth is likely to fall again because the figures show that in both the public and private sectors there have been exceptional one-off increases in the past year but quarterly wage growth is slowing: If the graph does not display click here The growth remains mostly in the private sector – with public-sector wages growing faster only in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania – and even in those three states the difference is marginal. By contrast the average wage growth of public servants in South Australia and the mostly commonwealth public servants in the Australian Capital Territory lags well below their counterparts in the private sector: If the graph does not display click here The wage growth over the past year across most industries has been faster than inflation but in the March quarter wages in the finance and utilities industries were the only ones to grow faster than prices: If the graph does not display click here Wages overall in the March quarter grew 0.8%, which was slower than the 1% rise in inflation. As I have noted often over the past two years, it is impossible for wages to drive inflation when they are actually rising slower than inflation! That said, over the past year the 4.1% wage growth is ahead of the 3.6% growth of prices. But the figures also show that this notional increase in real wages will not have been equally felt. In the 12 months to March the average prices of non-discretionary items (rents, energy bills, petrol, food, etc) went up 4.2%. For those on low and middle incomes who spend more of their income on these items, there will have been little to no increase in real wages. The biggest improvement will be for those who spend more of their income on discretionary items. If the graph does not display click here But even with that, the average growth of real wages is pitiful: If the graph does not display click here The mere 0.5% real wage growth over the past year is not even at the level it was during 2013-16 when nominal wages growth kept falling, let alone the stronger growth we had during the mining boom years. Remember that wages are supposed to grow faster than inflation – it is how living standards grow. But with such weak real wage growth it will take a long time to recover the living standards lost over the past few years. In March the value of Australians’ wages was equivalent to that in September 2010. In effect you can only buy the same amount of things now with your wage as you could 14 years ago. Or, to put it another way, the average wage now buys 5% less than it did in March 2020 before the pandemic hit. The good thing is the budget predicts further real wage growth over the next four years. But, even still, the budget papers predict by June 2028 the value of the average wage will only be back to the level it was in 2014. In effect we have lost 14 years of progress on living standards and, unless real wages grow faster than they did before the pandemic, we shall continue to be that far behind until the middle of next decade. A wages breakout? Please. If only. Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work",

        "title": "Raspberry Pi: how push for child programming skills inspired a coding generation ",
        "content": "Raspberry Pi, whose popular minicomputers are sold around the world, has come a long way since its co-founder Jack Lang had to store some of the first batch of single-board devices in his garage more than a decade ago. What started out as a project to reverse the decline in computer science applications at Cambridge University went on to inspire a generation of child programmers by offering them an affordable $35 (£28) minicomputer. Now the company is preparing to list on the London Stock Exchange. Designed by Cambridge engineers and computer scientists, the Pi was conceived as a durable, ultra-low-cost piece of hardware that would withstand being tossed into a backpack hundreds of times. Since its launch in 2012, about 60m of the credit card-sized devices, which run the Linux operating system, have been sold and they are now used in commercial applications across a variety of industries, including for electric vehicle charging. Behind the British tech firm is an eponymous educational charity that was established in 2008 with the goal of getting children interested in computer science. The foundation provides education resources, coding clubs, programmes and competitions that have reached more than 100 countries. One of the six founders of the Raspberry Pi Foundation is Eben Upton, who is now the chief executive of Raspberry Pi. Upton, who studied physics, engineering and computer science at Cambridge before working for the US tech companies Broadcom, Intel and IBM, started developing the first single-board computer prototypes in the evenings and at weekends while working at Broadcom, inspired by the BBC Micro he had used to do his schoolwork. Broadcom provided the chip for the Pi, and some of its employees were among the volunteers working on the project in the evenings, along with some students from the computer laboratory at Cambridge University. Lang, a serial entrepreneur and business angel in Cambridge, who chaired the foundation, died last month aged 76. Upton described him as “a central part of the Cambridge tech entrepreneurship scene”. Lang had designed software for the BBC Micro, a computer released in 1981 by Acorn Computers in Cambridge with a simple programming language which young children could follow. It started a computing revolution, and later influenced the Raspberry Pi. Peter Lomas, another foundation founder, did the hardware design for the final version of the Raspberry Pi. He is now the engineering director at Norcott Technologies and chairs the Royal Academy of Engineering. The other founders were Alan Mycroft and Robert Mullins, both computer science professors at Cambridge University, and David Braben, who co-created the Elite series of space trading video games and went on to set up the video games company Frontier Developments. Upton has said the foundation chose to name itself after a fruit in homage to other computer manufacturers such as Apple, while Pi is a reference to the fact that the founders were originally going to produce a computer that could only run the Python programming language. The foundation is part of a group that runs the National Centre for Computing Education in England, a government-funded initiative providing support for schools and colleges in England to offer a computing education, from key stage 1 through to A-level. At first, the Pi was manufactured in China but production moved to a Sony factory in south Wales in 2012. Almost all of the manufacturing is automated, with the 300 people who work in the factory mostly monitoring and maintaining the machines. “Given how far we’ve come, it’s sort of funny to remember how parochial our ambitions were at the start,” Upton has said. “There was a massive decline in the number of people applying to study computer science, which was sort of heartbreaking in a place like Cambridge, with its incredibly rich computing heritage. There was a feeling that if we could get a program or a piece of hardware into the hands of young people at the right point in their lives, we might be able to do something to reverse that decline.” • This article was amended on 16 May 2024. An earlier version said that Raspberry Pi had created Scratch, the first programming language for children. In fact it was conceived at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab.",

        "title": "JCB built and supplied equipment to Russia months after saying exports had stopped",
        "content": "The British digger maker JCB, owned by the billionaire Bamford family, continued to build and supply equipment for the Russian market months after saying it had stopped exports because of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the Guardian can reveal. Russian customs records show that JCB, whose owners are major donors to the Conservative party, continued to make new products available for Russian dealers well after 2 March 2022, when the company publicly stated that it had “voluntarily paused exports” to Russia. The data raises questions about the accuracy of JCB’s statements on its business in Russia and relationship with its biggest dealer there, Moscow-based Lonmadi, and that company’s former owner, UK-based JVM group. JCB has repeatedly said that it stopped exporting products to Russia and JVM companies after 2 March 2022 – less than a week after Putin sent troops into Ukraine. However, customs records collated by a trade data provider show the serial numbers of dozens of vehicles, worth millions of pounds, which appear to have been supplied to companies in Russia after that date. When the Guardian presented a sample of those records to the Staffordshire-based manufacturer, it admitted that JVM continued to collect diggers from JCB’s factories for months after the voluntary pause, but said that was due to contractual obligations. JCB also confirmed that the manufacturing of some of the equipment continued after that date. JCB’s lawyers said: “Any collection of goods by a JVM company after 2 March 2022 was pursuant to contractual obligations already entered into and completed or substantially completed prior to that date.” The company also denied any inconsistency or inaccuracy in its public statements. JCB’s chair, Anthony Bamford, 78, is one of the UK Conservative party’s biggest donors and a close ally and financial backer of the former prime minister Boris Johnson. Lord Bamford was made a Conservative peer in 2013, before retiring in March. The business was founded by Bamford’s father, Joseph Cyril Bamford, and according to the Sunday Times rich list the family is worth £5.9bn. JCB, one of the biggest privately held businesses in the UK, has 22 factories around the world, including in India and China, and had a sizeable presence in Russia at the time of the invasion in February 2022. The Bamford family’s business dealings have also come under scrutiny in recent months after the Guardian reported that Lord Bamford and his brother, Mark, could be hit with a bill for more than £500m to settle a long-running tax investigation by HM Revenue and Customs. Shipments to Russia JCB sells its products all over the world, but a significant – albeit unquantified – proportion of its sales came from Russia before the Ukraine invasion. After the invasion Bamford said, via lawyers, that he fully supported the UK government’s position on Russia. JCB’s lawyers said the company took “voluntary steps to pause the manufacture and supply of new orders to Russia from 2 March 2022” – a time when no relevant sanctions were in place. The company said it also closed down an assembly facility and other business operations in Russia, at considerable cost, and “suffered a very significant economic loss” through its voluntary actions. It also offered to house 70 Ukrainian refugees in company homes in Staffordshire. JCB’s business in Russia increased through a partnership with Lonmadi and JVM, which was owned by a Briton, Max Skillman. Trading under the Lonmadi and Kwintmadi names, the dealership grew to employ more than 1,000 people, mainly in Russia, and briefly propelled Skillman into the ranks of Britain’s wealthiest businesspeople. JCB’s sales in Russia continued to expand after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. In July 2022, the Observer revealed that Lonmadi was dealing with a subsidiary of Gazprombank, an arm of the Russian gas company and which was and remains under UK sanctions. A lawyer for Skillman said at the time that he had not broken any sanctions laws. Approached recently by the Guardian, Skillman said via his lawyer that JVM had divested itself of “all of its beneficial interest in Lonmadi and of any involvement in its management or operations” on 4 April 2022. JCB has also repeatedly said that it has cut ties with Russia. In July 2022, JCB’s lawyers told the Observer that all exports to Lonmadi and JVM had stopped after 2 March 2022. They wrote: “JCB has not since that date supplied any machinery to the dealer”, referring to JVM. They added: “Any JCB machinery that the dealer may have sold since March 2022 is stock that it already had in its possession before that date, over which JCB has no control.” After initial inquiries by the Guardian in February this year, lawyers for JCB reiterated that position, and said: “JCB ceased operating its dealer relationship with JSC Lonmadi in March 2022.” However, the collated customs data suggest that shipments from JCB factories continued to arrive with Lonmadi after that point, including 128 in July 2022 alone. A further 27 shipments arrived with Lonmadi on 9 August 2022, the data suggests – a month after the Observer asked JCB about its relationship with Lonmadi. For instance, the customs records suggest that one of those products, a JCB 205 skid steer digger, arrived for Lonmadi in Russia on 9 August 2022. A database on JCB’s website listed a “build date” for the digger of 29 April 2022. The vehicle’s serial number, which tallies with the customs data and JCB’s database, suggests it was built in JCB’s factory in Rajasthan, India. Public access to JCB’s database has been restricted since the Guardian’s inquiries. JCB’s lawyers confirmed that the digger was ordered by JVM in 2021. They said manufacturing of the digger started on 24 February 2022 – the exact date that Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – and was completed on 28 March 2022, weeks after the voluntary pause on exports was announced. In another case confirmed by JCB, manufacture in China of a digger ordered by a smaller Russian dealer in 2021 was completed on 7 March 2022, five days after the voluntary ban. The customs records suggest it arrived in Russia five months later. The company’s lawyers also confirmed that other JCB products that appeared in the data were collected from its Shanghai factory in July 2022. They said the orders were made before 2 March 2022, and that a Covid-19 lockdown in Shanghai may have been to blame for the delay. The collated customs data was sourced originally from bills of lading – legal trade documents – which are recorded on Russia’s electronic customs database. The data gives granular details about the extent of JCB goods that entered Russia, including commodity codes used to classify cross-border trade, serial numbers and a Russian-language description of the product. The Guardian was able to cross-reference dozens of the serial numbers using JCB’s own online maintenance database. ‘No direct role’ JCB admitted, via its law firm Schillings, that it continued to make its products available to JVM for months after 2 March 2022, which it said was in order to fulfil contracts that had been entered into before the invasion. The lawyers said that a customer’s collection of a product from its factory in relation to a contract that had been entered into prior to 2 March 2022 did not amount to exporting products to Russia after that date, or taking action contrary to its statements. They argued that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was not suitable grounds for “frustration or termination” of its contracts with dealers, because the invasion did not make it impossible or illegal for it to fulfil its contractual obligations. JCB also challenged the veracity of some of the data, with its lawyers saying that the data “appears to merely record shipment of a product manufactured by our client”. The lawyers added: “It does not demonstrate that our client had any direct role in facilitating the export of those products into Russia and even less so that it in any way financially benefited from those alleged exports.” JCB’s lawyers said that the data provided to them by the Guardian did not demonstrate that there has been any inconsistency or inaccuracy in their public statements. They also said that most of the examples cited by the Guardian were contracts with “non-Russian dealers”, which are not restricted by either JCB’s policy or by sanctions. Skillman, via his lawyer, said he does not have access to the operational records of the JVM companies, which are no longer trading, and declined to comment further or answer the Guardian’s questions. Lonmadi also declined to answer questions, but said that the company no longer has a business relationship with Skillman.",

        "content": "Burberry’s profits have slumped by 40% in a year amid a wider slowdown in demand for luxury goods that has pushed down sales in Asia and the Americas. The high-end UK fashion retailer posted a pre-tax profit of £383m for the year up to 30 March in its preliminary results on Wednesday, a 40% drop on the £634m in the previous 12 months. Global sales fell by 8% in the second half of the year. It said it now expects a challenging first half of next year, with the company promising to balance investment in consumer-facing areas with disciplined cost control. The latest figures come after the company issued a profit warning in January, predicting operating profits of between £410m and £460m over the year, blaming the cost of living crisis and higher interest rates for the decline. Adjusted operating profit came in at £418m in the results released on Wednesday. The company’s share price slumped by 3% in early trading, before partly recovering to 1.5% down. Shares are 53% lower than this time last year. Overall sales for the year were down by 1% compared with the previous 12 months but the second half of the year showed particularly sluggish sales, down 8% year on year. This was largely driven by a significant drop-off in sales in the Americas, where sales fell by 14% in the second half of the year, and by 12% across the whole year. In Asia and the Pacific sales were up by 3% over the full year but nosedived in the second half of the year by 7%, compared with the previous year. This was driven by China, where sales dropped by 19% for the final quarter of the year. Last week, Burberry’s fellow British luxury brand Mulberry reported a 4% decline in sales, while blaming a slowdown in luxury spending in the UK and Asia. In March the luxury fashion group Kering issued a profit warning after reporting that demand for its leading brand, Gucci, had dried up in China. Yanmei Tang, an analyst at Third Bridge, said: “Burberry is among the brands that have been affected by a slowdown observed across the wider luxury industry. High-end customers have become pickier about what they buy. “Our experts say Burberry is struggling to clearly define and elevate its brand identity, resulting in confusing messaging and poor sales growth. There is too much reliance on a new creative direction rather than making operational changes.” Jonathan Akeroyd, Burberry’s chief executive, said: “Executing our plan against a backdrop of slowing luxury demand has been challenging. “While our full-year financial results underperformed our original expectations, we have made good progress refocusing our brand image, evolving our product and strengthening distribution while delivering operational improvements. “We remain confident in our strategy to realise Burberry’s potential as the modern British luxury brand and in our ability to successfully navigate this period.”",

Businesses have described the government’s new border control checks as a “disaster” after IT outages led to lorries carrying meat, cheese and cut flowers being held for long periods, reducing the shelf life of their goods and prompting retailers to reject some orders. The worst disruption was last weekend, with dozens of lorries being held at the government’s control post serving Dover and the Channel tunnel for periods of between eight and 20 hours after the IT system that registers goods went down. Ministers brought in physical checks on animal and plant products from the EU at the start of this month as part of its post-Brexit import regime. However, since their introduction, problems with the government’s Automatic Licence Verification System (ALVS) have led to an increasing number of lorries being held at border posts for many hours while the checking of documents is carried out manually. The Guardian spoke to several importers and customs agents whose lorries were stopped at the Sevington post in Ashford, Kent, over the weekend after the IT system failed. One company that imports Italian goods said that 18 of the 23 lorries that came through the Port of Dover were sent to Sevington, with some having to wait between nine and 20 hours before being released. In one case, a lorry entered the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) facility at 6am on Sunday, and was only able to leave at 2am Monday morning. A manager at the company, who preferred not to be named, said: “We were expecting maximum hold-ups of four hours, and, if they weren’t checked by then, they would be released. This is a lot longer.” The government confirmed that a technical issue had affected Defra’s digital services on Saturday, which had affected the ALVS. To overcome the problems, importers had to manually submit documents to border officials to be checked before they could be released. Defra said there had been no significant delays to border checks. The managing director of a Polish transport company said the weekend had been a “disaster” for importers, resulting in a lot of angry customers. “There was huge disorder, and a lack of information about the status of the lorries,” he said. Mariusz, a driver who had been held at Sevington for more than eight hours, told the Guardian that the delay had led to him being late for a drop-off. He said there were 25 other lorries stuck at Sevington, some for 15 hours, with little information being given on when they would be released. Other custom agents and importers complained that it was impossible to get through to Defra officials on the phone on Sunday. A representative of a company that sends 70 lorries a week to the UK, said it had seen 40 vehicles sent to Sevington last week for document checks, with the hold-ups leading to some customers rejecting deliveries. He said: “We have fresh products from Poland and eastern Europe, which can take two to three days to transport to the UK. If there is another delay of a day or two, it’s really too late to sell them to final customers.” Traders said this was the latest in a list of problems with the government’s IT systems since the border checks were brought in on 30 April, with the ALVS being down on two other occasions. Nigel Jenney, the chief executive of the Fresh Produce Consortium, said: “There’s been several incidents like this in the last two weeks, and several much more minor issues. There is a huge concern factor. This is causing not just huge disruption, but it’s a huge cost for the sector.” A Defra spokesperson said: “A power outage over the weekend affected one of the systems required to process imports. For the majority of vehicles at the border there were no significant delays, but we immediately activated contingency arrangements for affected vehicles, working alongside HMRC and Border Force. “We are working at pace to resolve the issue and expect that systems will be returning to normal functioning soon. Since the introduction of checks, our teams have been working closely with traders to ensure checks are completed efficiently and swiftly.” • Have you been affected by delays at the UK border posts?

        "title": "Anglo American’s breakup is overdue. BHP must have seen it coming | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "Get rid of the bad bits, keep the good ones. Anglo American’s defence strategy cannot be called original – especially as half of it is borrowed from the approach of the would-be bidder, BHP. One could also ask why, since Anglo has been simplifying itself for about two decades already, its board required the heat of a £34bn takeover battle to discover more urgency. But there is a genuine plus in the mix: Anglo’s breakup plan is plainly more radical than anything it has attempted in the recent past. It also achieves the first requirement of a quasi-defence document by putting the onus on the bidder to come up with a real bid or shut up. BHP, if it wants to own Anglo’s best assets, will have to table a clean offer for the whole collection, as opposed to making a complex approach to own two-thirds of the company as long as the defender demerges the unwanted other third beforehand. In a showdown between the two “complicated” breakup visions for Anglo’s short-term future, the defender’s plan looks superior: clean the decks first and then, if returns are still inadequate in a few years’ time, a conventional bid battle can be allowed to happen. The assets deemed by Anglo as worth retaining are copper, iron ore and crop nutrients – the last being the planned fertiliser mine under the North York Moors, which was acquired in 2020 and is the only “Anglo” part of Anglo aside from the head office. As a portfolio, yes, two of those parts make sense. Copper is the go-to metal for electrification of the world’s energy systems; iron ore never goes out of fashion. The loose element is the Woodsmith mine near Whitby, which has been a money pit to this point. Anglo now says it will slash investment to zero in 2026 to protect its balance sheet. When will first production happen? Answers are noncommittal. That is the weakness in the plan: even with the offloading of other assets, the group is still muttering about recruiting “one or more strategic partners” to help fund a “multigenerational resource”. But there’s not much to complain about in the exit corner. Anglo American Platinum, which already has a separate listing in Johannesburg, will be demerged; nickel put on “care and maintenance”; the 85% stake in diamond giant De Beers will be sold; coking coal in Australia is also up for grabs. None of that is problematic because most of those assets are reasons why Anglo’s shares labour under a conglomerate discount. BHP, which would have kept the coking coal in Queensland, might be interested in that asset. Some sovereign wealth fund or other might want De Beers. The future-looking question is how long Anglo will take to complete its rejig. The chief executive, Duncan Wanblad, reckons most of the job will be done by the end of 2025, which would count as reasonably slick if achieved. At that point, Anglo would be in a position where it would either perform for its shareholders or represent a cleaner takeover target. The immediate question is whether BHP comes back with a fresh approach. The market’s guess was no, which is why Anglo’s shares fell 3% on Tuesday. But it would be an odd tactic on the part of the BHP boss, Mike Henry, to make a weird-looking initial offer and then bow out when Anglo adopts a predictable breakup defence. Henry has either played this all wrong, or else he’s yet to show his true cards.",

        "title": "Tesco CEO’s near £10m pay a ‘slap in the face’ for struggling workers, union says",
        "content": "Tesco has been accused of giving struggling workers a “slap in the face” after the UK supermarket’s boss earned almost £10m last year as profits soared during the cost of living crisis. Ken Murphy was given £9.9m in pay and perks, more than double the previous year and thought to be the most ever for a Tesco boss, beating £7m-plus paydays for the former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy. More than half of Murphy’s payout relates to a long-term bonus worth three times his basic salary paid in shares that must be held for at least two years. A further £3.4m annual bonus is linked to sales, profits and individual objectives, according to Tesco’s annual shareholder report, which was published on Tuesday. The increase in total pay means that Murphy now earns more than 430 times the average pay at Tesco, up from a multiple of 197 in the previous year. He is one of the best-paid executives among the leading FTSE 100-listed companies, although still well behind the £18.7m that the best paid – the AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot – could earn this year. Tesco, which owns the Booker grocery wholesaler and runs stores in eastern Europe and the Republic of Ireland as well as the UK, last month revealed pre-tax profits had soared by 159% to £2.3bn – the highest in more than a decade – in the year to 24 February. Sales rose 7.4% to almost £61.5bn, led by strong expansion online and in large stores. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, said: “Ken Murphy’s £5m wage increase is a slap in the face to the millions of struggling workers and their families who paid for it through higher food bills. The fact is, Tesco has taken advantage of the cost of living crisis to rake in obscene profits, and it is far from the only one.” Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, added that Murphy’s pay gap with a typical employee was the third highest since pay ratio reporting began five years ago. He said: “You couldn’t really get a better indicator of how the UK economy serves the interests of the super-rich at the expense of everybody else than this – a multimillionaire chief executive trousering another £10m while their customers endure major price rises and their employees have to get by on less than a quarter of a per cent of what the CEO takes home.” Murphy missed out on 5% of his potential annual bonus, or £176,000, after Tesco missed targets on cutting food waste, while his fixed pay slipped to £1.6m from £1.7m a year before, after the company stopped subsidising his commuting. Alison Platt, the chair of Tesco’s remuneration committee, said Murphy’s pay was benchmarked against pay for other FTSE 50 companies and other comparable international businesses. “This pay award reflects the fact Tesco has delivered for all of its stakeholders over the last year – from its most competitive-ever customer offer to its record investment in colleague pay. “A large proportion of the total package has been achieved because the business met stretching targets in a highly competitive sector and worked to create value for customers, colleagues, suppliers, communities and shareholders.” This year, Murphy’s basic salary rises 3% to £1.46m from £1.41m, so he could earn more than £9m again. The figures have emerged after Tesco was condemned by some staff as a month-long delay to a promised pay rise at the supermarket left them on less than the minimum wage, while saving the supermarket more than £17m. About 220,000 staff shared a £70m “thank you” payment after the rise in profits, equivalent to 1.5% of annual pay, with a full-time shop worker expected to receive about £300. The report also shows long-term share bonus payouts for the former boss of Tesco Dave Lewis and the former finance director Alan Stewart, who received shares worth almost £1.6m and £1.7m respectively in the past year based on performance while they were in the business.",

        "title": "Anglo American to sell famous diamond business De Beers in breakup plan",
        "content": "South Africa has backed Anglo American’s plan to sell the famous diamond business De Beers as part of a historic corporate overhaul to defend the company against a £34bn takeover plot. The embattled London-listed mining company set out a radical new strategy to dismantle parts of the 107-year-old company, including the sale of the world’s biggest diamond miner, after fending off a second unsolicited takeover offer from the Australian miner BHP. The proposal has won support in South Africa, which is Anglo’s largest shareholder through its Public Investment Corporation (PIC) and the birthplace of Anglo and De Beers. The South African mining minister, Gwede Mantashe, said that he would prefer Anglo’s restructuring plan over a takeover by BHP. The plan was also welcomed by the Congress of South African Trade Unions. The Anglo chief executive, Duncan Wanblad, said the “most radical changes to Anglo American in decades” would create a simplified company with a focus on its remaining “world-class assets” in copper, iron ore and fertilisers. The overhaul is designed to fend off further unsolicited advances from BHP, which sought to force Anglo to off-load its two Johannesburg-listed subsidiaries, the platinum miner Amplats and iron ore miner Kumba, before completing the deal. Instead, Anglo’s overhaul would include letting go of De Beers alongside the “orderly” sale or demerger of its South African platinum business and its steel-making coal assets. Anglo also plans to slow its investment in the Woodsmith fertiliser mine in the North York Moors next year from £1bn a year to £200m before seeking strategic investors to restart full-scale work on the polyhalite project from 2026. Mantashe told the Financial Times: “I am happy with the rejection of the BHP deal and I hope it will continue, then Anglo can restructure itself to optimise value for shareholders.” BHP’s chief executive, Mike Henry, urged Anglo investors to consider the merits of his company’s bid. He said: “They have to look at the plans, decide which one they believe is going to create the greatest value soonest.” Anglo’s strategy raises questions over the future of De Beers, which has been linked to Anglo American for almost 100 years. The diamond miner was founded in South Africa by the British mining magnate Cecil Rhodes who began sending gems back from South Africa to London in 1889. It was part-owned by the Oppenheimer dynasty, which founded Anglo American, from the 1920s until the family sold its 40% stake to Anglo in 2011. Today, Anglo holds 85% of the company while the government of Botswana holds the remaining 15%. A source close to the company said Anglo was considering an initial public offering of De Beers as “the default option” for the business. However, the idea has been dismissed as “unlikely” by another source owing to the difficulty in establishing the future value of diamonds after a volatile period for the market. The diamond business has struggled with falling sales in recent years because of the sluggish global economy and rising competition from lab-created alternatives. The source said it would be easier to dismantle De Beer’s interests in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana as well as its synthetic diamond business to sell off separately. Wanblad said De Beers remained “a great business” which has already seen interest from prospective investors. “There’s no doubt in our mind that the structural issues that everyone talks about will pass,” he added. The chief executive faces pressure from investors to prove that he can turn around Anglo’s flagging market value, which has left the company vulnerable to takeover by larger rivals. BHP’s takeover plans are expected to face competition from the Swiss mining company Glencore and the British-Australian miner Rio Tinto. Wanblad dismissed BHP’s approaches as “highly unattractive” because they undervalue the company’s long-term potential value. He also criticised BHP for the “disrespectful” timing of the approach before what is expected to be a highly contested general election in South Africa at the end of the month. Wanblad said BHP’s approach had forced him to set out a new strategic vision for the company at a critical time for South Africa’s government, which holds a 7% share of the company through the PIC. “I would have handled this in a very different sort of way – and a very private sort of way,” he said of BHP’s approach. The governments of South Africa and Botswana were approached for comment.",

        "title": "Bank of England chief economist hints at summer rate cut; Tesco CEO’s pay doubles to nearly £10m– as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up The chief executive of Britain’s largest supermarket, Tesco, more than doubled his pay package to nearly £10m last year. Ken Murphy received £9.93m during Tesco’s last financial year, up from £4.44m a year earlier. Much of the increase was due to a Performance Share Plan (PSP) payout of £4.91m. Tesco said the PSP payout reflected “strong performance against stretching targets over a challenging period.” But the High Pay Centre said Murphy’s huge pay packet illustrated how the UK economy serves the interests of the super rich at the expense of everybody else. The Unite union accused Tesco of giving struggling workers a “slap in the face”. Details of Murphy’s pay were released on a day when UK unemployment rose to 4.3%, as firms cut back on staff. But regular pay, which strips out bonuses, was unchanged, recording growth of 6%, meaning real wages continued to grow. The Bank of England’s chief economist Huw Pill suggested that the BoE may be able to consider cutting interest rates this summer. He told an online presentation organised by the ICAEW, an accountancy body, that: “I think it’s not unreasonable to believe that through the summer we will begin to see enough confidence in the decline in persistence that Bank Rate will come into consideration.” The money markets suggest that there’s an even change of a cut, or no change, at the Bank’s June meeting. Elsewhere today, Kremlin critic and anti-corruption campaigner Bill Browder has urged MPs to introduce a US-style law that would allow the government to confiscate frozen Russian assets to support military efforts in Ukraine. Browder told the Treasury Committee that using around $300bn of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine could “change the whole nature of the war”, and act as an insurance policy in case Donald Trump wins the US presidency and cuts support for Kyiv. Browder also named refineries in India, Turkey and China which he claimed were processing Russian oil and selling refined products to the West. US president, Joe Biden, has announced a 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles as part of a package of measures designed to protect US manufacturers from cheap imports. The global carmaker Stellantis is to sell cheap electric cars made by its Chinese partner Leapmotor in Europe, including the UK, as it criticised Joe Biden’s decision to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs imported to the US. Spending on the NHS in England has risen less quickly than the Conservatives promised at the last election despite the extra demand created by the pandemic and record waiting lists, a leading thinktank has said. Anglo American plans to sell the diamond business De Beers as part of a sweeping plan to break up the company to defend it against a £34bn takeover plot by its rival BHP. But there are concerns that cuts to spending at its Woodsmith fertilizer mine in the North York Moors National Park could lead to job losses. Vodafone has said its turnaround plan is starting to show results as Germany, its largest business, returned to growth last year after the sale of its Italian and Spanish operations. Ofgem could allow energy suppliers to once more vie for new customers by offering them cheaper deals than existing policyholders receive, under proposals to reignite competition in the market. Ken Murphy’s pay packet isn’t the only thing that has doubled. Over on Wall Street, the meme stock fever is in full cry. Shares in electronics retailer GameStop jumped by around 100%, before sliding a little, while cinema chain AMC Entertainment are up 90% in early New York trading. Retail traders’ interest in GameStop, the struggling video games chain, has been reignited by the re-emergence of an influencer known as Roaring Kitty. Earlier this week Keith Gill, the influencer known as Roaring Kitty, posted on X for the first time since the height of the meme stock frenzy in 2021. He shared a sketch of a gamer leaning forward, as if things were getting serious – and followed up with a string of clips from movies and TV shows. Three years ago Gill’s videos on YouTube, and posts on Reddit, where he is known as DeepFuckingValue, placed him at the front of an army of meme-toting day traders who tried to mount a rebellion against Wall Street – and the financial titans dominating the market. More here. Tesco CEO Ken Murphy’s £10m pay packet for last year shows that the UK’s economic model serves the super-rich at the expense of everybody else, says Luke Hildyard, Executive Director of the High Pay Centre. Hildyard is concerned by the “extreme disparity” between the CEO’s pay and the pay of Tesco’s workers. Murphy’s pay is 447 times greater than a full time Tesco worker at the lower quartile of the workforce and 431 times greater than the median Tesco employee, as this chart from today’s annual report shows: Hildyard says this is one of the worst pay gaps on record: “This is the third highest gap between the CEO of any firm and their typical employee recorded since pay ratio reporting began five years ago. You couldn’t really get a better indicator of how the UK economy serves the interests of the super rich at the expense of everybody else than this - a multi-millionaire Chief Executive trousering another £10 million while their customers endure major price rises and their employees have to get by on less than a quarter of a percent of what the CEO takes home.” Back in the economics world, US producer price inflation was hotter than expected last month. US services companies and manufacturers raised the cost of their goods and services by 0.5% in April, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, following a 0.1% drop in March. This may potentially discourage the US Federal Reserve from considering cuts to interest rates soon, given concerns that inflation is looking sticky. Services prices rose by 0.6% in the month, while goods prices were up 0.4%. On an annual basis, PPI inflation rose to 2.2% for the 12 months to April, up from 1.8% in the year to March. That’s the highest annual reading since April 2023, when PPI was 2.3%/year. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, explains: The bigger-than-expected 0.5% m/m increases in both all items and core final demand producer prices in April were mainly due to downward revisions to earlier months, with the 0.2% m/m gains in March both revised to 0.1% declines. As a result, the annual rate of all items final demand PPI inflation only edged up to 2.2%, from 2.1%. That modest increase in the annual headline rate was mainly due to a 5.4% increase in gasoline prices, however, which, with crude oil prices slumping more recently, should be more than reversed in May. Ken Murphy has surged near to the top of the list of best paid FTSE 100 CEOs, with his £10m pay packet for last year. He’s not at the top, though. AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, received a pay package of nearly £17m last year, and could be paid £18.7m this year. Another pharmaceuticals boss, Emma Walmsley of GlaxoSmithKline, received a 50% rise last year, taking her annual pay packet to £12.7m. Back in March, The Observer reported that median pay for the companies listed on the pan-European Stoxx 600 index, which includes the biggest UK companies, was €3.5m (£2.9m) in 2022. Ken Murphy actually only received 95% of his potential annual bonus for last year. He missed out on the maximum award, because a target of reducing food waste by 47% was missed. That meant Murphy received £3.377m, out of a maximum of £3.555m (250% of his basic pay). Ken Murphy’s whopping pay packet of £9.9m for last year works out at an equally jaw-dropping £190,000 per week. That’s the amount you might pay a top-class Premiership footballer for a week – or more than five times the annual pay for an NHS nurse. Can anyone, really, be worth £10m per year, just for running a supermarket? The Sunday Times reported last month that some analysts argue the £10 million man is worth every penny, after steering Tesco through a pandemic, then raised its market share during a cost of living crisis. Richard Hyman, of Thought Provoking Consulting, told them: “He’s done a terrific job. Ken has unashamedly focused on the thing Tesco is really good at: mass market grocery retailing. Tesco’s supermarkets have fewer bells and whistles these days, but they are far more reliable on product availability, price and value… and that’s fundamental.” Tesco’s CEO Ken Murphy needn’t fret about the cost of living squeeze, it seems, after more than doubling his pay last year to almost £10m. Murphy was paid £9.9m in the last financial year, up from £4.4m in 2022/2023. Tesco’s 2024 annual report, just released, shows that Murphy’s basic pay rose by 3% to £1.41m. He also received an annual bonus of £3.38m, up from £2.73m last year. Murphy’s pay packet was further swelled by a £4.91m payout from Tesco’s Performance Share Plan (PSP). This award is paid in Tesco shares, and are based on performance since 2021. Britain’s largest supermarket chain says: The significant year-on-year increase in remuneration primarily reflects the first vesting from these awards, which themselves reflect strong performance against stretching targets over a challenging period. That challenging period covers a time in which many familes struggled to put food on the table, as grocery and energy prices soared – which means Murphy’s pay packet may prove controversial. CFO Imran Nawaz’s annual remuneration also more than doubled, to £4.95m from £2.27m. Tesco says: A large proportion of the total package has been achieved thanks to both Ken Murphy and Imran Nawaz achieving stretching targets in a highly competitive sector and working to create value for customers, colleagues, suppliers, communities and shareholders. Tesco adds that it “remains committed to a competitive and fair reward package for all colleagues”, and spent £300m on a pay rise for its hourly-paid staff. In the economic world, there are glimmers of optimism in America and the eurozone today. US small-business confidence increased last month, despite firms struggling with a shortage of workers, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). NFIB’s Small Business Optimism Index rose by 1.2 points to 89.7 for April, having slid to an 11-year low in March. Encouragingly for consumers, the share of owners planning to raise prices was the smallest in a year Bill Dunkelberg, NFIB chief economist, says: “Cost pressures remain the top issue for small business owners, including historically high levels of owners raising compensation to keep and attract employees.” Meanwhile in Germany, investor morale has improved by more than expected in May. The ZEW economic research institute’s economic sentiment index jumped to 47.1 points from 42.9 points in April, higher than expected. Bill Browder has also named the oil refineries which are taking Russian oil, refining it, and setting the products to the West. Browder suggests that such refineries could be sanctioned, or legislation could be passed to block sales from these sites. He then names them on the record, for the Treasury Committee. In India, they are the Vadinar Refinery, which is 49% owned by Russia’s state oil company, Rosneft, the Jamnagar Refinery in the Gulf of Kutch, on India’s western coast, and state-owned companies Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum. In Turkey, he names STAR Rafineri which stuck a deal with Russia’s Lukoil. And in China, he names Sinopec Group and CNOOC (China National Offshore Oil Corporation). Browder adds: Those are alll companies who buy Russian oil. When we talk about India, China and Turkey we’re talking about specific companies. We don’t need to sanction India, China and Turkey, we can just go after the companies that are buying the oil. He urges MPs to put these names into their report into Russian sanctions, as this would add to the pressure on these companies. If Russia can’t find a market for its oil, then the price will go down, and Moscow will have less money to fund its war with Ukraine. Bill Browder then urges MPs to copy the US, and pass a law to remove any ambiguity over whether frozen Russian assets can be confiscated, and used to fund Ukraine. That REPO Act was passed with the $61bn aid package which was approved by Congress last month. Browder tells the Treasury Committee today: What I would suggest is done here is some version of the REPO Act, where – to the extent that there’s any legal concern – you legislate away that legal concern so that it can be properly done here. If the US and the UK both approved such legislation, it would put more pressure on the European Union to “do the right thing in the end”, Browder explains. The European Union’s proposal of using windfall profits from frozen Russian assets to finance arms supplies to Kyiv, rather than the assets themselves, is “a typical EU bad compromise”, he adds. Browder argues there’s no difference between taking the profits and simply taking all the money, so the EU’s plan is a “fudge” that will prolong the inevitable. Western governments should use the seized Russian assets they control to fund the war in Ukraine, as an ‘insurance policy’ in case Donald Trump wins the US presidential election, MPs have been told. Financier and political activist Bill Browder explained to the Treasury Committee this morning that it would “change the whole nature of the war” if the West were to confiscate $300bn of assets from Russia. Browder, who set up the Magnitsky Campaign after his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, died in custody in Russia in 2009, explains to MPs that the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a “resource war”. Currently Russia has more resources than Ukraine, and Putin is “banking” on the West having less appetite for the war than him, as it drags on, Browder explains. Browder cites the delays getting Ukraine funding approved by the US House of Representatives this year, saying: If this money were to be confiscated, it is five times the $65bn that the US had been dragging their feet on. It would completely change the situation… in a context where we’re almost two and a half years into this war, and whether we like it or not, some of our allies are going to be less likely to fund this war. Browder says he is “particularly concerned” about what might happen in the US, where Donald Trump is leading in the swing states. Trump has made it very clear that he would end the war in 24 hours – by stopping funding Ukraine. Currently, the US provides half the funding for Ukraine, so either Ukraine loses war or “we have to double down”, explains Browder. This money, this three hundred billion, would solve that problem. It would basically be an insurance policy against that problem. Britain has been ramping up pressure on western governments to use frozen Russian assets to help rebuild Ukraine’s war-shattered economy. In January, foreign secretary David Cameron told the World Economic Forum in Davos that there were legal, moral and political justifications for action. The EU, though, is favouring using only the profits from those assets to help Ukraine. Browder adds that he doesn’t think confiscating Russian assets would have any impact on the markets, rejecting claims that it would destabilise the markets. He also suggests it could deter China from attacking Taiwan, telling MPs: It would sent a message that if you launch an unprovoked war of aggression, you’re likely to have your foreign exchange reserves confiscated. He adds that the cost of supporting Ukraine will fall on taxpayers, unless politicians take the plunge and use Russian frozen assets instead. Anti-corruption campaigner and Kremlin critic Bill Browder has told MPs not to be fooled by claims from Moscow that sanctions aren’t working. Testifying to the Treasury committee this morning, Browder explains that president Putin has claimed several times that sanctions introduced after the invasion of Ukriane aren’t working. Putin argues that the Russian economy is doing well, so the West should stop hurting themselves with sanctions on trade with Russia. Browder, though, smells a rat, telling MPs: Sanctions are crippling Russia. The numbers that you receive about the ‘success’ of the Russian economy….the Russian state statistics committee produces those numbers. The Russians lie in every other area, I don’t see any reason why we should believe those numbers coming out of Russia. [Reminder: Rosstat has reported that Russia’s economy contracted by just 1.2% in 2022, the first year of the Ukraine war]. Browder reminds MPs of the measures taken against Ukraine: Western governments froze around $300bn of central bank reserves the week after the Ukraine war started The UK have sanctioned 57 of the 98 oligarchs who are listed as influencial by the US, meaning their money is effectively imobilised. The foreign borrowing of Russian companies and government has been curtailed 1,500 Western companies have retreated from Russia There’s been an $80bn swing in foreign direct investment, from +$40bn of FDI before war, to -$40bn now. But the “big, big loophole” is the sale of oil, Browder continues; oil which Russia used to sell to the West is now being sold to India, China and Turkey. This presents two problems. First, Russia continues to get a lot of money from that oil – beween half a billion and a billion dollars per day. Second, the oil is being processed in refineries in India, China and Turkey, and returned to the West as refined oil products. Browder estimates that $23bn of refined oil products is being sold back to the EU, and the UK bought $2.2bn of that refined product last year. He tells the Treasury Committee: As long as Russia can sell the oil, Russia can use that hard currency to buy weapons, and they can use those weapons to kill Ukrainians. This means the West are funding both sides of the war, Browder explains, meaning something has to give. What Putin is hoping is going to give, is that we’re going to run out of patience the fund the Ukrainians. China might feel like a victim of heavy-handed US action today, but shouldn’t think the 100% tariffs on its electric cars are anything new, my colleague Phillip Inman explains. In the 1980s president Ronald Reagan imposed 100% tariffs on billions of pounds (in today’s money) of Japanese imports after years of beligerent protests from an increasingly protectionist Washington administration. Japanese car makers reacted by relocating factories inside the US, while the Tokyo government bottled up whatever anger it had to preserve good relations with its military protector. Economic historians have noted that it mainly benefited Korean car makers rather than US car workers. Korean firms like Hyundai began to make headway in the US market under the radar. China has found a way round existing tariffs by sending goods via Mexico, which has seen a boom in exports to the US. So a clampdown on this new trade route is possible in the near future. The sweeping tariffs on Chinese electrical goods announced by the White JHouse a few minutes ago will impact around $18bn of imports, Bloomberg has calculated. NEWSFLASH: The US president, Joe Biden, has announced a 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles as part of a package of measures designed to protect US manufacturers from cheap imports. In a move that is likely to inflame trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies, the White House said it was imposing more stringent curbs on Chinese goods worth $18bn. Sources said the move followed a four-year review and was a preventive measure designed to stop cheap subsidised Chinese goods flooding the US market and stifling the growth of the American green technology sector. As well as a tariff increase from 25% to 100% on EVs, levies will rise from 7.5% to 25% on lithium batteries, from zero to 25% on critical minerals, from 25% to 50% on solar cells, and from 25% to 50% on semiconductors. Here’s the full story: There are fears of job cuts at the Woodsmith fertilizer mine in the North York Moors National Park, as owner Anglo American announces details of a plan to break itself up. Fresh from rejecting a takeover approach from rival BHP Group, Anglo has revealed a series of sweeping changes this morning, which will refocus its on copper and premium iron. The plan includes Demerging its Anglo American Platinum division – something which BHP pushed for its takeover proposal Selling or demerging its diamond operation, De Beers Selling its Steelmaking Coal operations Slowing the development of the Woodsmith project to support Anglo American’s balance sheet deleveraging. Anglo is proposing to slash capital expenditure at Woodsmith to zero in 2026, down from $200m in 2025. Simon Clarke, Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, fears the plan will “clearly have significant implications for the dedicated workforce” at Woodsmith. The level of real pay for UK workers is rising at its fastest rate in more than two years despite a cooling of the labour market that has led to rising unemployment and falling job vacancies, the latest official figures show. Fresh data from the Office for National Statistics showed the mild recession in the second half of 2023 has had an impact on demand for workers but has been slower to affect wages. The ONS said unemployment rose by 166,000 between the final three months of 2023 and the first three months of 2024, pushing up the jobless rate from 3.8% to 4.3%. More here. The Bank of England’s chief economist has said it is “not unreasonable” to think the central bank could consider cutting interest rates over the summer, Reuters reports. This has knocked the pound, which is down almost half a cent this morning at $1.252. Huw Pill told an online presentation organised by accountancy body ICAEW that if inflation continues to look less persistent, the Bank could consider lowering Bank Rate. He says: “I think it’s not unreasonable to believe that through the summer we will begin to see enough confidence in the decline in persistence that Bank Rate will come into consideration.” Pill also explained that the UK’s labour market remains tight by historical standards, despite this morning’s rise in unemployment and the gradual slowdown in pay growth. He said: “There has been an easing of the labour market but it still remains pretty tight by historical standards.” Pill also pointed to the slowdown in private sector pay growth in this morning’s data (to 5.9%, see here), saying: “We actually got some additional data this morning that would be consistent with a small additional decline in the first quarter.” PIll was one of seven MPC members who voted to keep interest rates on hold last week, while just two policymakers voted to cut. Following his comments today, the momney markets now indicate there is a 53% chance of a rate cut at the BoE’s next meeting in June, up from around 50% earlier today. OpenAI has shaken up the artificial intelligence world by releasing their latest AI chatbot, OpenAI say that GPT-4o – the “o” stands for “omni” – is a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction. It brings the faster, more accurate GPT-4 AI model to free users (previously you had to pay), and can accept any combination of text, audio, and images as input. And demonstrations show just how powerful the new chatbot is. In one demonstration, GPT-4o created a bedtime story about love and robots, telling it in a variety of different emotional and vocal inflections. Another demonstrations showed it translating in real time between English and Spanish – an example of the way that AI could shake up the employment sector….. … it can do English &lt;-&gt; Italian translations too! GPT-4o has also been designed to sound chatty and sometimes even flirtatious, as the BBC’s technology editor, Zoe Kleinman, explains here: Using a warm American female voice, it greeted its prompters by asking them how they were doing. When paid a compliment, it responded: “Stop it, you’re making me blush!”. It wasn’t perfect – at one point it mistook the smiling man for a wooden surface, and it started to solve an equation that it hadn’t yet been shown. This unintentionally demonstrated that there’s still some way to go before the glitches and hallucinations which make chatbots unreliable and potentially unsafe, can be ironed out. The UK’s economic slowdown last year has caused Britain’s jobs recovery to falter, explains the Resolution Foundation this morning. They point out that the post-pandemic workforce has shrunk by the equivalent of one million workers, compared to before Covid-19. But the slowdown hasn’t yet fed through into pay packets, with real wages now growing at their fastest in rate in over two years, Resolution points out. Nye Cominetti, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, says: “Britain’s jobs recovery continues to falter, with the workforce shrinking by the equivalent of one million workers since pre-pandemic times. This worrying employment fall shows the damage that an economic slowdown can cause. “The news for those in work is more positive however, with real wages growing almost as much over the past 12 months as they did in the 16 years prior to this. “The big question is whether the UK’s recent economic recovery will boost employment and raise output per worker, which will be needed to sustain its mini pay recovery.” Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at King’s College London, has analysed today’s economic inactivity data: Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, also believes today’s jobs data could support a Bank of England rate cut in June. Brooks explains: The uptick in the unemployment rate is garnering a lot of attention this morning. It rose to 4.3%, the highest level since July last year, and above the average unemployment rate of the last 5 years, which is 4.2%. However, this is still a very low level, and for the last three years, the unemployment rate has been in an approximate range between 3.5% - 4.5%. This supports the BOE view that the UK’s economy is 1, resilient against higher interest rates, and 2, that disinflation is occurring while there is still virtually full employment. Thus, the rise in the unemployment rate to the top of the medium term range, is not a cause for concern, but it could support a rate cut from the BOE next month. The money markets are suggesting there is an evens chance that the Bank of England starts cutting interest rates in June. There is currently a 50.2% chance of a cut next month, LSEG data shows, and a 49.8% chance that the BoE leaves interest rates on hold…. James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, says the cooling UK jobs market bolsters the chances of near-term rate cut. He agrees that “it’s looking pretty 50-50 right now” between June and August for the first rate cut. Today’s jobs report shows there are now almost 9.4 million people who are economically inactive (neither in work, nor looking for a job). Many of these people are keen to work, though, points out Stephen Evans, chief executive at Learning and Work Institute: “The labour market continues to ease with employment and vacancies down. The number of people economically inactive due to long-term sickness is up 700,000 since the pandemic. But 1.7 million people who are economically inactive say they would like a job. The answer isn’t further tightening benefit eligibility or focusing on a so-called ‘sick note culture’; it’s widening and improving help to find work.” Here are the key charts from today’s labour market report, showing the state of the UK jobs market: Wages rose faster in the public sector than the private sector in the first quarter of the year. Today’s jobs report shows that regular earnings (ex bonuses) in the public sector grew by 6.3% in the January-March quarter But in the private sector, basic pay grew by 5.9% – the lowest since April-June last year. Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, says: The UK labour market continues to show signs of cooling – which should spell good news for the MPC. Private sector regular pay growth – while still elevated – came down a little more than the Bank of England was expecting at 5.9% (3m/YoY). While we expect wage growth to remain sticky through the April period given the large 10% hike to the National Living Wage, this will give the MPC some confidence that data outturns are broadly in line with their own expectations. Digging into today’s pay data, we can see that earnings rose fastest in manufacturing, and finance and business services – with regular pay (ex bonuses) up 6.8% per year in both sectors in January-March. The construction sector saw the smallest annual regular pay growth across sectors, at 2.6% (activity fell in this sector in the last quarter). Today’s jobs data is “very disappointing again”, warns Tony Wilson, Director at the Institute for Employment Studies. Wilson points out that there are now 900,000 more people out of work than before the pandemic began, with virtually all of this due to higher economic inactivity. He says: There appear to be three key reasons for this: fewer older people coming back to work, more young people in education or out of work, and more people off with long-term health conditions across all ages. Last month, Rishi Sunak claimed Britain is suffering from a “sicknote culture”, and announced a trial under which “work and health professionals” rather than GPs would issue fit notes. However, UK workers take fewer sick days than those in France, Germany or the US. Wilson explains: However for all the talk about this being driven by a ‘sicknote culture’, the reality is that the UK has among the lowest rates of sickness absence in the world, while our analysis shows that the growth in ill health is being driven primarily by fewer people with health conditions coming back to work rather than more people leaving. So we need to do far more and better to make our employment services more accessible, inclusive and supportive, rather than just threatening to change the rules or cut people’s benefits.” The TUC are also concerned that the jobs market is weakening. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak says: “The Tories are presiding over a rapidly deteriorating jobs market. “Unemployment and economic inactivity are shooting up. Over a million people are trapped on zero-hours contracts. And real wages are still worth less than in 2008. “Forget ‘green shoots’ - everywhere you look the Conservatives are failing working people. “Our country is crying out for a proper economic plan for jobs and growth to make sure household incomes can recover and everyone is secure at work. “And our NHS desperately needs investment to get waiting lists back down. When people can access treatment faster, they will return to work sooner.” Alison McGovern MP, Labour’s acting shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, says today’s jobs report shows things are “just getting worse” under the current government. McGovern also blames high NHS waiting lists for the jump in people who are now economically inactive, explaining: “The morning after Rishi Sunak told us his plan was working, these damning new figures prove that things are just getting worse: employment down, economic inactivity up and unemployment rising. “It’s no wonder there are now a record number of people locked out of work due to long-term sickness, given NHS waiting lists are spiralling and the Tories have pushed our NHS to its knees. “It’s Labour who have the plan to get Britain working by driving down waiting lists, reforming job centres, making work pay and supporting people into good jobs across every part of the country. Change with Labour can’t come soon enough.” The UK’s weakening labour market is a “harbinger of interest rate cuts”, says Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. Selfin says other indicators have also shown a “gradual deterioration in the labour market”. That could encourage the Bank of England to consider cutting interest rates – if it also sees signs that pay rises are slowing. Selfin explains: “There were signs of some increased momentum in regular pay, with wage growth rising across a range of sectors in March. Consumer-facing services such as hospitality, where vacancies remain high and workers are more likely to benefit from the rise in the National Living Wage, could see continued pressure this summer. However, we expect overall headline wage growth to slow in the coming months on the back of weaker hiring activity. “Next month will be key in terms of pay data as it will provide initial evidence of the impact of April’s National Living Wage increase. If it comes in line with our expectations of only a modest boost, and sufficient to keep annual pay growth on a downward trajectory, this could ignite more dovish sentiment on the MPC ahead of their June vote.” The increase in economic inactivity in the latest quarter was largely because of those inactive because they were temporarily sick, long-term sick, or retired, the ONS says. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt is cheered that real wages are continuing to rise, saying: “This is the 10th month in a row that wages have risen faster than inflation which will help with the cost of living pressures on families. And while we are dealing with some challenges in our labour supply, including pandemic impacts, as our reforms on childcare, pensions tax reform and welfare come online I am confident we will start to increase the number of people in work.” Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Mel Stride MP, says: “We are leaving no stone unturned to get people back to work, rolling out the most radical changes to welfare in a generation including reforming how we assess someone’s capability to work, overhauling the fit note process and helping over a million people through our £2.5bn Back to Work Plan. We’ll always be on the side of hardworking families and with real wages still rising, alongside tax cuts and the huge boost to the National Living Wage, we are incentivising work over welfare as we build a strong economy where everyone has a brighter future.” The ONS has also published some neat regional data, showing the labour market across the UK. Here’s the details: The highest employment rate estimate in the UK was in the South East (78.6%) and the lowest was in the North East (69.1%), for the three months ending March 2024. Northern Ireland saw the largest increase in the employment rate compared with the same period the previous year, increasing by 1.0 percentage point, with the North East seeing the largest decrease of 3.5 percentage points. The highest unemployment rate estimate in the UK was in the East Midlands (5.6%) and the lowest was in Northern Ireland (2.1%), for the three months ending March 2024. The North West had the largest increase in the unemployment rate compared with the same period the previous year, increasing by 2.0 percentage points, with Wales seeing the largest decrease of 1.2 percentage points. The highest economic inactivity rate estimate in the UK was in Wales (28.0%) and the lowest was in the South East (18.2%), for the three months ending March 2024. The North East saw the largest increase in the economic inactivity rate compared with the same period the previous year, up 3.9 percentage points, with the Northern Ireland seeing the largest decrease of 0.8 percentage points. The number of people on UK company payrolls also appears to have fallen last month. The ONS estimates that payrolled employment decreased by 85,000 employees in April when compared with March. However, the statistics office says we should treat this as a provisional estimate. And indeed, March’s payroll data has been revised higher this morning – from a decrease of 67,000 to a decrease of 5,000. On an annual basis, there are 129,000 more employees on payrolls than in April 2023; this is driven by a 170,000 increase in employees in the health and social work sector. Today’s labour market report shows some signs tht the jobs market is cooling, say ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown: “We continue to see tentative signs that the jobs market is cooling, with both employment from our household survey and the number of workers on payroll showing falls in the latest periods. “At the same time the steady decline in the number of job vacancies has continued for a twenty-second consecutive month, although numbers remain above pre-pandemic levels. With unemployment also increasing, the number of unemployed people per vacancy has continued to rise, approaching levels seen before the onset of COVID-19. “Earnings growth in cash terms remains high, with the recent falls in the rate now levelling off while, with inflation falling, real pay growth remains at its highest level in well over two years.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain’s unemployment rate has risen as companies cut back on hiring, and more people drop out of the labour market, often due to ill health. The latest UK labour market statistics, just released this morning, show that the jobless rate has risen to 4.3% in the first quarter of this year, up from 4.2% a month ago and 3.8% in the previous quarter. That’s the highest unemployment rate in nearly a year, since March-May 2023. Another 166,000 people become unemployed in the quarter, taking the total out of work and looking for a job to 1.486m. The number of people in employment dropped by 178,000 – another signal that the labour market is cooling – taking the total in work to just below 33 million. Vacancies fell too: down by 26,000 in the three months to April, to 898,000. In another worrying sign, the UK’s economic inactivity rate jumped to 22.1% in January to March, up from 21.9% in the final three months of 2023. That highlights the rise in people leaving the workforce – perhaps for illness, or due to caring responsibilities. But pay growth remained strong – which may disappoint the Bank of England as it looks for signs that inflationary pressures are easing. Regular earnings (excluding bonuses) rose by 6.0% in the last year, while total pay (including bonuses) rose 5.7% – with both readings unchanged compared with last month. This means that real wages continue to grow, with earnings rising faster than CPI inflation. The ONS says: Using CPI real earnings, in January to March 2024, total pay was 2.1%. Growth was last higher in July to September 2021, when it was 3.0%. Regular pay was 2.4%; growth was last higher in June to August 2021, when it was 3.4%. Also coming up today Later this morning we’ll hear from BoE chief economist Huw Pill, one of the monetary policy committee members who voted to leave interest rates on hold last week. UK farmers are heading to Downing Street to meet PM Rishi Sunak for the second Farm to Fork summit, to discuss the challenges in the farming industry. Global investors are bracing for the latest US Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which will show how quickly America’s manufacturers and services companies raised their prices last month. The PPI report could reinforce, or ease, concerns that US inflation is looking sticks. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, explains: If this month’s PPI data doesn’t show a decline, there is potential for rates to drift higher, which could lead to a slide in stocks. And in Miami, mining executives have gathered for the Bank of America Global Metals, Mining &amp; Steel Conference 2024.

        "title": "‘It will take two decades to fix the housing crisis’: The developer reshaping south London",
        "content": "A new “town centre”, a cluster of four buildings with towers of varying heights, is springing up at Elephant and Castle, one of the busiest junctions in south London, to replace the demolished 1960s shopping centre. Residents and local traders have expressed fears it will turn into “another Westfield with all sorts of chain shops”, as local Liberal Democrat councillor Maria Linforth-Hall put it. But Rick de Blaby, chief executive of Get Living, the company behind the project – which has built and manages 4,000 rental homes, including the former Olympic Village in Stratford – is adamant this won’t happen. “I can see why people are concerned about that, but I don’t think that’s where we want it to end up,” he tells the Observer from the “trunk room” in the temporary site office, overlooking a cluster of red cranes and a vast building site (there is also a “tusk room” – in keeping with the elephant theme). “You need a few recognisable names that anchor your scheme. But we have a vision for bringing in far more independent local traders that really bring a character and a definition to the place. Otherwise, it becomes another slightly formulaic shopping centre.” He points to Get Living’s nearby Castle Square centre, which has 27 small traders, including 19 who had been based in the previous Elephant and Castle complex. Demolished in 2021, it was one of Europe’s first large indoor shopping centres when it opened in 1965. Its distinctive statue of a pachyderm carrying a tower – constructed in the image of an older sculpture at a coaching inn after which the whole area is named – will go on display at the new site, alongside nearly 1,000 homes, shops, restaurants, offices and a cinema, as well as a new campus for the London College of Communication. It is due to be completed in 2026. After local opposition and Southwark council’s rejection of its initial plans, Get Living revised its proposals to include more affordable housing, including 116 socially rented flats, up from 33, and affordable shop rents for at least 10% of the units. The company was set up in 2013 by a client fund of the UK property group Delancey and Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. Then last year, Qatari Diar’s 22% stake was bought out by Aware Super, an Australian pension fund. The Dutch asset manager APG and an investment vehicle led by Oxford Properties and Delancey own 39% each. The firm offers three-year tenancies with a resident-only break clause, with no fees or security deposits, and with rent reviews based on consumer price inflation. De Blaby, who joined Get Living in 2017, says: “The vision was: can we create a business that seeks to disrupt a slightly dysfunctional private rental market?” Get Living charges an average monthly rent of £2,700 in London, with studios at £1,945. This compares with £1,195 for a one-bedroom flat and £1,995 for a three-bed at its Salford site in Manchester, while its homes in Maidenhead have just launched starting at £1,550 for a one-bed. It’s not cheap but in return tenants get a concierge, an on-site maintenance team and amenities such as a gym and free wifi. Average private rents in Britain have risen to record highs, hitting £1,291 outside London and £2,633 in the capital in the first quarter, according to the property website Rightmove. Official figures showed the average private rent rose by 9.1% in the year to March. Scotland temporarily capped rent increases at 3% between September 2022 and last month, but De Blaby believes rent caps do not work, suggesting they deter investors. He argues that the underlying supply issue needs to be addressed: “The big story is: how can we get on and build more homes?” He is calling for a comprehensive plan to fix the UK’s housing crisis. “Whoever’s in government, start by really being able to articulate what our grand vision is for housing in the UK, because if we can create something that is inspiring and positive … we’ve got a chance of changing the mindset of a lot of people to be pro-development, rather than anti-development.” At the Olympic Park in east London, Get Living took over the former athletes’ quarters, which the government’s Olympic Delivery Authority turned into flats after the 2012 Olympics ended, buying them for around half of what the village cost to build. It now manages 2,445 rental homes at East Village, while 1,379 affordable flats are managed by the housing association group Triathlon Homes. In January, a court ruled that Get Living, as the owner of East Village, must pay £18m to upgrade fire safety standards at five of the 66 blocks, seven years on from the deadly Grenfell Tower fire. Leaseholders in shared ownership properties managed by Triathlon have been unable to sell their flats since the defects were discovered in 2020, and Triathlon brought the lawsuit. Get Living says it was not involved in the design, build or retrofit of the properties, and that it will appeal. “The first-tier tribunal recognised that liability was not synonymous with fault, so they were saying it wasn’t our fault, but we were still liable under the terms of the Building Safety Act,” says De Blaby. “And there was also a comment that those with the broadest shoulders should pay, and they deemed that we had the broadest shoulders. But Get Living are the custodians of millions of key worker pensions [as it is backed by pension funds].” De Blaby says a further 33 blocks need fire safety repairs and “there’s more exposure to go for all of the other buildings” that still need to be assessed. “We in turn are going to be forced to litigate all of the contractors that built those buildings, below the government’s own regulations at the time. We have been pretty shocked at some of the standards to which those contractors have built in terms of missing fire-stopping and insulation and so on.” He stresses that “no one lives in an unsafe home in East Village” and that he is “empathetic to the people who are impacted”, promising to fix all the fire defects “within the next couple of years”. De Blaby grew up in the Midlands and went to one of Britain’s oldest public schools, Bromsgrove near Birmingham, as a day boy “because my parents couldn’t afford the boarding fee”. His mother took a job as a receptionist for an estate agent to pay the fees (his parents divorced during his teens). De Blaby did holiday jobs with estate agents and architects, and wanted to be an architect. “I was often messing about drawing buildings or making buildings out of Lego,” he recalls. Following his estate management degree, at Oxford Polytechnic, now Oxford Brookes University, he got a couple of jobs in London, “colouring in plans and making tea”. His first proper job was at the developer Trafalgar House, where he “learned to be a developer for 10 years”. He ran the commercial development and mixed-use regeneration activities of Countryside Group before landing his first CEO role at MEPC, a former FTSE 100 property developer that is now owned by the manager of the British Telecommunications and the Post Office pension funds. He then worked with private equity when he turned around United House Group and sold most of the business. Get Living is part of the UK’s nascent build-to-rent sector, which accounts for less than 2% of housebuilding but will grow to 15%-20% in the coming years, De Blaby predicts. “It’s got a really important role to play in the UK housing market. It has the ability to deliver affordable as well as market rented housing and innovative things like co-living. It’s about attracting global capital to really try and address the housing market that we’ve got.” However, he warns: “It will take two decades to fix the housing crisis, and I fear it’s going to get worse before it gets better.” CV Age 64 Family Married, three adult sons.

        "title": "Vauxhall owner to sell cheap Chinese EVs in UK and mainland Europe",
        "content": "The global carmaker Stellantis is to sell cheap electric cars made by its Chinese partner Leapmotor in Europe, including the UK, as it criticised Joe Biden’s decision to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs imported to the US. Stellantis, which owns brands including Fiat, Peugeot and Vauxhall, will start selling two Leapmotor models in September, at prices of less than €20,000 (£17,200). UK sales will start in March 2025. Carlos Tavares, the Stellantis chief executive, said the move would allow it to profit from the wave of Chinese cars coming to Europe, and strongly decried protectionism as the US launched steep tariffs to shield its own industry. Biden on Tuesday announced a 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles, as the US industry lagged behind China and Europe. However, Tavares said tariffs would increase inflation in the US, a key political concern before the presidential election in November. China has taken a global lead in producing battery electric vehicles, and is the world’s biggest electric car market. Dozens of Chinese manufacturers, including BYD, which vies with Tesla as the world’s single biggest electric car manufacturer, are starting to sell cars in Europe. European and US carmakers are scrambling to catch up with China’s host of EV makers, which often benefit from direct government support, cheaper labour costs and China’s dominance of global battery supply chains. Tavares portrayed the deal with Leapmotor, which is likely to increase China’s surging battery vehicle sales, as a pragmatic and “opportunistic” move to profit from the rise of Chinese manufacturers. “Whether I like it or not they are grabbing share,” he said. “What I can do is leverage that dynamic.” The first models to be sold in Europe will be the T03, a small, five-door city car, and the bulkier C10 SUV. Stellantis also owns big US brands including Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge, but Tavares strongly opposed Biden’s measures to protect US manufacturers. Tavares said three automotive “bubbles” were being created in the US, Europe and China via trade barriers. Tariffs are “just going to end up with more inflation inside the bubble”, he said. “Protectionism has a lot of drawbacks. They don’t appear immediately; they appear one after the other.” Tavares acknowledged that the situation for Chinese-made vehicles in Europe could change if the EU also decided to impose tariffs. The EU is examining whether Chinese electric cars are being dumped in Europe, which could lead to tariffs or other barriers in response. Stellantis will own 51% of the Amsterdam-headquartered Leapmotor International, while the Hangzhou-headquartered Leapmotor will own 49%. Leapmotor was founded in 2015 by Zhu Jiangming, an electrical engineer. Stellantis had previously invested in Leapmotor in a deal agreed in October. The partnership will expand Leapmotor sales to India and the Asia Pacific region, the Middle East and Africa, and South America starting in the fourth quarter of 2024.",

        "title": "Vodafone hails turnaround progress as Germany returns to growth",
        "content": "Vodafone has said its turnaround plan is starting to show results as Germany, its largest business, returned to growth last year after the sale of its Italian and Spanish operations. The telecoms company has been undergoing a transformation programme under its chief executive, Margherita Della Valle, who has sought to simplify the group and taken action in three underperforming markets where Vodafone’s returns were below the cost of capital. Vodafone sold off its Spanish division for €5bn (£4.3bn) as well as announcing an €8bn sale of its operations in Italy and a proposed merger with CK Hutchison’s Three in the UK which is being considered by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the anti-trust regulator. The telecoms company reported a 74% fall in operating profits for the year ended 31 March 2024 to €3.7bn against €14.4bn because results in the previous year were bolstered by exceptional gains including an €8.6bn gain on the sale of its Vantage Towers business as well as sales of Vodafone Hungary and Vodafone Ghana. Vodafone is pressing ahead with cost-cutting measures. It has shed 5,000 roles and is cutting a further 2,000 as part of a €1bn cost reduction target; its aim is to axe up to 11,000 jobs by 2026. Della Valle said that underlying performance in Germany was expected to improve so that by 2026 the country “will come back to being an important growth engine for the group”. She added that Vodafone was holding “deep conversations” with the CMA in the UK as the regulators examine the Three deal. The CMA has warned mobile customers could face higher prices and reduced quality as a result of the potential merger. Della Valle said: “Much more still needs to be done in the year ahead. We will step up investment in our customer experience, improve our underlying performance in Germany and accelerate our momentum in business, while also continuing to simplify our operations.” Vodafone has already said it will rebase its dividend and plans share buy-backs over two years, with €2bn from the proceeds of the Spanish business in 2025 and a further €2bn proceeds from the Italian arm in 2026. The telecoms group faces questions about the 14.6 % stake held by its largest investor Emirates Telecommunications, which the UK government has identified as a national security risk. Ministers have ordered a national security committee to be set up at Vodafone to help oversee sensitive work. However a recent report authored by three barristers including Sir Robert Buckland KC, a former lord chancellor, concluded that the UAE’s stake in Vodafone raised serious concerns given UAE’s intelligence gathering apparatus and poor human rights record. The barrister Ben Keith, who co-authored the report, has urged that the planned national security committee should be independent of Vodafone and include national security experts. There should also be enhanced data security and audits and also Vodafone should collaborate with human rights organisations and conduct regular assessments, the barristers suggested. Vodafone said of the report: “Vodafone has extensive data security and privacy measures in place. Sensitive customer data is not visible to anyone – including the group CEO – outside our specific, security-vetted customer teams. Vodafone has a long-established human rights policy, which is developed in line with international standards as well as industry-specific principles.”",

        "title": "Biden announces 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles",
        "content": "The US president, Joe Biden, has announced a 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles as part of a package of measures designed to protect US manufacturers from cheap imports. In a move that is likely to inflame trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies, the White House said it was imposing more stringent curbs on Chinese goods worth $18bn. Sources said the move followed a four-year review and was a preventive measure designed to stop cheap subsidised Chinese goods flooding the US market and stifling the growth of the American green technology sector. As well as a tariff increase from 25% to 100% on EVs, levies will rise from 7.5% to 25% on lithium batteries, from zero to 25% on critical minerals, from 25% to 50% on solar cells, and from 25% to 50% on semiconductors. Tariffs on steel, aluminium and personal protective equipment – which range from zero to 7.5% – will rise to 25%. In response, China’s state mouthpiece news outlet published an editorial on Wednesday, accusing the US of “undermining fair trade and environmental protection”, while saying that it was US consumers who would bear the brunt of the tariffs. “Ironically, the United States is a country that touts open economy and free trade, but its actions are against its words. It also promises that it does not seek to decouple from China and hinder China’s development, but its practices tell another story,” it said. Despite the risks of retaliation from Beijing, Biden said the increased levies were a proportionate response to China’s overcapacity in the EV sector. Sources said China was producing 30m EVs a year but could sell only 22m-23m domestically. Biden’s car tariffs are largely symbolic because Chinese EVs were virtually locked out of the US by tariffs imposed by Donald Trump during his presidency. However, lobby groups have suggested there is a future threat as Beijing seeks to use exports to compensate for the weakness of its domestic economy. The Alliance for American Manufacturing has said the introduction of Chinese cars to the US market would be an “extinction-level event” for its carmakers. Since arriving in office, the president has announced a series of measures – such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips Act – to boost US industry in hi-tech sectors and in battleground states, where the 2024 election with Trump is likely to be decided. Biden has taken a hard line on trade since arriving at the White House in 2021 and believes his plan offers a more targeted – and less risky – approach to the threat posed by China than that of his rival. In March, Trump said that, if elected as president later this year, he would put a 100% tariff on “every single car that comes across the line” from Chinese-owned manufacturing plants in China. “They are not going to sell those cars,” he said. Trump has promised to raise taxes on all Chinese imports by 60%, an approach critics say would raise prices for US consumers already grappling with high inflation. In April, Biden said he was “not looking for a fight with China” but that the US needed to stand up to China’s “unfair economic practices and industrial overcapacity”. “I’m looking for competition, but fair competition,” he said. The new tariffs will kick in after 90 days from Tuesday – a period that will be closely watched for signs of tit-for-tat retaliation by China. White House sources said the aim was not to escalate trade tensions but to help parts of the US economy where there had been a cycle of disinvestment.",

        "title": "UK unemployment may not reach its worst, but economic rebound will stall",
        "content": "The TUC boss, Paul Nowak, could be accused of exaggeration when he says “the Tories are presiding over a rapidly deteriorating jobs market”. The UK has experienced many periods when unemployment has deteriorated more quickly and the number of people out of work reached greater peaks. The union leader is concerned after the latest labour market figures showed unemployment rising by 166,000 over the last quarter to 1,486,000 to reach 4.3% of the workforce. Emphasising the noticeable deterioration in the jobs market, the number of vacancies fell and the amount of workers in employment also dropped, indicating that firms are neither looking for as many workers as they were previously, nor are they prepared to hang on to as many as they once did. Joe Nellis, the professor of global economy at the Cranfield School of Management, expects the rise in the unemployment rate to continue towards the end of the year, peaking at about 5%. Yet, the numbers are not huge in a historical context and the economy is growing, as we found out last week when the Office for National Statistics produced figures for national output, or gross domestic product (GDP), covering the first quarter. The 0.6% rise in GDP between January and March this year marked a turnaround from last year’s recession and indicated businesses were more optimistic about the year ahead. Pay growth is also consistently strong, allowing Jeremy Hunt to boast that wages have risen faster than inflation for the past 10 months, easing the cost of living pressures on households. Still, Nowak’s analysis not only gathers up the evidence of a slowdown from the current figures, but also looks ahead to the summer and autumn, when one of the biggest costs facing businesses and homeowners, namely interest bills, is likely to remain high. The Bank of England seems determined to keep interest rates painfully onerous for those with debts to service, even if it slices a few tenths of a percentage point off the 5.25% total before the end of the year. Almost 1 million homeowners will need to remortgage this year, adding an average £1,800 to their bills. Combined with the extra interest costs paid by businesses, it is a sizeable amount of money to take out of the economy. A steeper fall in interest rates could keep consumer spending higher and save many businesses from going under. As it is, thousands of firms will suffer from this loss of cash in circulation, especially in the hospitality industry, laying off even more workers. The end result is unlikely to send unemployment shooting back to levels last seen in the 1980s and early 1990s – when rates hit double digits – but the effect will stall the recent economic rebound before it has even really got going.",

        "title": "UK real pay grows at fastest rate in two years as unemployment rises",
        "content": "The level of real pay for UK workers is rising at its fastest rate in more than two years despite a cooling of the labour market that has led to rising unemployment and falling job vacancies, the latest official figures show. Fresh data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the mild recession in the second half of 2023 has had an impact on demand for workers but has been slower to affect wages. The ONS said unemployment rose by 166,000 between the final three months of 2023 and the first three months of 2024, pushing up the jobless rate from 3.8% to 4.3%. Employment fell by 178,000 over the same period, while further evidence of a cooling labour market came from a drop in job vacancies, down by 26,000 to 898,000 in the three months to April. The UK’s economic inactivity rate jumped to 22.1% in January to March, up from 21.9% in the final three months of 2023. The number of people inactive because of long-term health problems rose by 20,000 to 2,820,000 in the first quarter of 2024 – a new record high. ONS figures for earnings showed total pay – including bonus payments – was 5.7% higher in the three months to March than a year earlier, unchanged on February. Regular pay, which strips out bonuses, was also unchanged, recording growth of 6%. Annual inflation as measured by the consumer prices index stood at 4% in January, but fell to 3.4% in February and 3.2% in March. Earnings growth and the demand for workers are two of the indicators being closely watched by Bank of England interest-rate setters and the latest figures will provide a mixed message for Threadneedle Street as it considers whether to cut borrowing costs next month. Speaking on Tuesday, the Bank’s chief economist, Huw Pill, said it was “not unreasonable” to think the central bank could consider cutting interest rates – currently at 5.25% – over the summer. Financial markets are pricing in a roughly 50% chance the Bank will start cutting rates at its meeting next month. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: “This is the 10th month in a row that wages have risen faster than inflation, which will help with the cost of living pressures on families. And while we are dealing with some challenges in our labour supply, including pandemic impacts, as our reforms on childcare, pensions tax reform and welfare come online, I am confident we will start to increase the number of people in work.” Alison McGovern, Labour’s acting shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The morning after Rishi Sunak told us his plan was working, these damning new figures prove that things are just getting worse: employment down, economic inactivity up and unemployment rising. “It’s no wonder there are now a record number of people locked out of work due to long-term sickness, given NHS waiting lists are spiralling and the Tories have pushed our NHS to its knees.” Liz McKeown, an ONS director of economic statistics, said: “We continue to see tentative signs that the jobs market is cooling, with both employment from our household survey and the number of workers on payroll showing falls in the latest periods. “At the same time the steady decline in the number of job vacancies has continued for a 22nd consecutive month, although numbers remain above pre-pandemic levels. With unemployment also increasing, the number of unemployed people per vacancy has continued to rise, approaching levels seen before the onset of Covid-19. “Earnings growth in cash terms remains high, with the recent falls in the rate now levelling off while, with inflation falling, real pay growth remains at its highest level in well over two years.”",

        "title": "NHS spending rise lags behind Tory funding pledges, IFS finds",
        "content": "Spending on the NHS in England has risen less quickly than the Conservatives promised at the last election despite the extra demand created by the pandemic and record waiting lists, a leading thinktank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said increases in funding from the government had been eaten up by higher than expected inflation and, as a result, NHS day-to-day spending had grown by 2.7% a year during the current parliament – below the 3.3% pledged by Boris Johnson in 2019. The IFS said that “despite a pandemic, record waiting lists and growing rates of ill health, real-terms health spending has risen less quickly than was planned five years ago. “This breaks the habit of a lifetime: over the past 40 years, the NHS budget has almost always grown more quickly than originally planned. This parliament is the exception.” At the 2019 election, the Conservatives pledged to increase spending by £34bn a year by the end of the parliament. The IFS said this amounted to a 29% cash increase between 2019 and 2020 and 2024-25, which given the expected levels of inflation at the time amounted to a 3.3% annual increase in real terms day-to-day spending. The latest plans involve a bigger cash increase of 37% but much higher inflation means a real terms increase of 2.7% a year. Inflation as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) rose sharply as economies emerged from lockdowns imposed during the pandemic, peaking at 11.1% in October 2022. Last year, the government and unions thrashed out a two-year NHS pay deal after strike action. The thinktank also said the NHS was in a poor state of repair due to a lack of investment over the past decade and a half. After being cut back sharply in the 2010s, capital spending has increased in recent years – though in 2023–24, the capital budget in England was raided to fund day-to-day pressures, returning to the bad practice of the late 2010s. “One consequence of low capital spending is the deterioration of the NHS estate in England, where the maintenance backlog has more than doubled over the past decade,” the IFS said. Although day-to-day NHS spending has undershot the plans made in 2019, the IFS said Britain’s weak growth during this parliament meant health spending had grown as a share of GDP and now accounted for more than 40% of total public spending. The latest plans implied no real-terms growth for the NHS England budget from 2023–24 and 2024–25, and there are no published plans for health spending after that. The IFS said the next government would come under pressure to increase the health budget, adding that both main parties had endorsed the NHS England workforce plan, which will require real-terms funding growth of about 3.6% a year if it is to be achieved. Max Warner, an IFS economist, said: “The sheer size of the health budget means that delivering funding increases at anything like the historical average would require cuts elsewhere, even before accounting for recent promises on defence spending. “Neither the Conservative party nor Labour party have been keen to set out spending plans. But the next government will have to confront this reality – and fast.” Spending per person on the NHS is higher in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland than in England, although the gap has narrowed in recent decades. In 1999–2000, Scotland spent 22% more per person than England, Wales spent 12% more and Northern Ireland spent 15% more. But in 2019–20, on the eve of the pandemic, Scotland spent 3% more, while Wales and Northern Ireland each spent 7% more. A department of health and social care spokesperson said: “We are providing the NHS with record funding of nearly £165bn a year by the end of this parliament, an increase of 13% in real terms compared to 2019-20, which is making a real difference in cutting waiting lists. “The chancellor also announced at the budget that the NHS in England will receive a £2.5bn day-to-day funding boost this year and a further £3.4bn investment in the latest technology from 2025, helping to unlock £35bn in savings.”",

        "title": "Children of austerity need a rescue plan, Gordon Brown says",
        "content": "Gordon Brown has called for a rescue plan for “austerity’s children” – a generation of more than 3 million UK young people born after 2010 from low-income families who “have never known what it is like to be free of poverty”. The former Labour prime minister urged the government to create a multibillion pound programme of support for a “blighted generation” that has grown up under Tory rule amid huge public spending cuts, Covid, the cost of living crisis and the Ukraine conflict. He drew parallels with “Thatcher’s children” – a cohort of young working-class people who grew up amid mass unemployment, societal upheaval and social security cuts of Britain in the 1980s. Austerity’s children – who account for 3.4 million of the UK’s 4.3 million children living below the poverty line – would face extra health, educational and employment challenges as a legacy of the “decade-long experiment” of fiscal austerity, he said. At the centre of Brown’s proposed programme of support for children is a relaunch of the Sure Start early-years scheme, in part funded by a £1bn social impact fund. Sure Start was a flagship New Labour government policy launched in 1998, but at least 1,000 centres have been closed since 2010. Brown has made several interventions on welfare policy in recent months, describing Britain’s worsening levels of destitution as “obscene”, and calling for root-and-branch reform of its “systematically shredded” benefits system in a series of pamphlets and lectures. Although he has been careful to direct his proposals at the current government – he called on the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to use his planned September mini-budget to help families in severe hardship – it is clear he sees the UK’s deepening poverty “epidemic” as a problem for a future Labour administration. Brown’s latest pamphlet, Partnership to End Poverty, published on Tuesday, calls for “a clear vision and deliverable timetable from our government to end destitution now, and poverty in 10 years”, bringing together the state, charities and businesses with the aim of eradicating material hardship within a generation. Writing in the Guardian, Brown said: “Most [of austerity’s children] have never known what it is like to be free of poverty. And yet in almost every single year of the last decade, even as their need has been mounting, the government’s support for children has been spiralling downwards, each year more difficult than the year before as, with almost surgical precision, the government has made the already poor even poorer.” He adds: “Commentators now write about Britain’s endemic problem of underinvestment, highlighting the state of our railways, roads, utilities and physical infrastructure; but there has been less focus on the decade-long experiment – the greatest and most damaging underinvestment of all inflicted on austerity’s children, who will, soon enough, come of age. The damage to them runs deep.” Brown said children born in the 2020s were likely to be even poorer than those born a decade earlier, with the number of UK children in poverty – 4.3 million – likely to rise in the immediate future to a record 4.5m. His £3bn proposals for protecting the poorest families, funded in part by a bank reserve funds levy, include a revitalised Sure Start programme, support for unemployed people and those on low wages to get better-paid jobs, and an extension to the household support fund, due to end in October. In his pamphlet, Brown called for a cross-government poverty taskforce to be created: “The sprawling nature of the poverty crisis – which has tentacles reaching into health, education, work, community, energy, transport and more – should banish any illusion that this is a challenge that can be safely led from any one department,” he wrote. Brown’s intervention reflects wider concerns about the health and life chances of a generation hit by Covid and austerity. Earlier this year, children’s services leaders called for a national “plan for childhood” to address the needs of a generation of young people scarred by austerity and the pandemic. A government spokesperson said: “We will continue to make every effort to tackle child poverty, which is down since 2010. Our £108bn cost of living package also prevented 1.3 million people, including 300,000 children, falling into absolute poverty with the heightened cost of living pressures driven by the war in Ukraine and impact of Covid. “Children are less likely to be in poverty where all adults work, and our £2.5bn back to work plan will help over a million people break down barriers to work while we also cut taxes, boost the national living wage and drive down inflation to support hard-working families.”",

        "title": "Charities attack Tesco rules for evening-only collection of unwanted food",
        "content": "Tesco is facing criticism from “shocked” charities who say they are struggling to distribute unwanted food to homeless and hungry people after they claim the retailer brought in rules that mean unwanted food can only be collected in the evening. The supermarket group has switched to a new system which asks charities to pick up unwanted food, such as items reaching their best before date, only in the evening when a store is closing rather than the following morning, the charities have claimed. Seven local groups, including Food for Charities in Oxford, Abingdon Community Fridge and the Zero Carbon Guildford Community Fridge, have written to Tesco warning that surplus food is no longer going to the people who need it the most, leaving some groups now buying food instead to distribute to homeless people. They have also launched a petition calling on Tesco to rescind the changes. “Most of us struggle to find volunteers to pick up in the evenings. Most of our charities do not have recipients for ‘evening food’ such as meat and sandwiches because we close our doors before the Tesco food is available,” the letter from charities to Tesco says. “We do not have room for freezers, or our freezers are located in community facilities that are locked in the evening, or we do not feel happy sending lone volunteers into a building to put food in a freezer.” Some charities also reported that a system under which they had a period of time to get “first dibs’” on Sunday collection slots had now been altered so that they claimed they were in competition with users of the Olio food waste app, which could include well-off families, to grab slots first. In a separate email seen by the Guardian, a regional representative from the charity FareShare, which oversees the waste collection process in Tesco stores, said the retailer had made the “estate wide change” after testing different methods at some stores over the last few years. “Tesco have made the decision to change the donation time at almost all Tesco stores across the country, from the morning to the evening,” the email reads It said the changes had been made so that Tesco could donate chilled food alongside longer-life items such as baked goods, fruit and vegetables and this was not possible with morning collections. Chilled items tend to have a ‘use by’ date which means they could be unsafe if consumed the next day. Tesco denied it had made widespread changes, saying it had always encouraged the 2,700 local charities which collect food from its stores to pick up in the evening rather than the morning. It said there was no difference in Sunday collections to any other day of the week. Riki Therivel, director of Food for Charities which runs a number of community fridges in Oxford, said her group had not received any warning about the change which now meant it had to spend about £50 a week on buying food. She said the amount of food available for its community fridge system, which feeds hundreds of people, had also halved. “It’s a big shock for us and an increased expense. “We can’t pick up in the evening so we will be getting less food in future,” she said. “It is difficult for charities to pivot.” Farrah Rainfly, operations manager at Lifeafterhummus, a north London charity which redistributes food , said she was angry that the changes had been made with “no discussions”. “It really is putting profits before people,” she said. “Treating people in need of food like garbage disposal.” A spokesperson for the supermarket said: “We work hard to prevent food from going to waste and donate millions of unsold meals from our stores to local charities and community groups each month. “We’ll always prioritise local charities to receive food from FareShare, but, if they are not able to collect the food, we offer it to other local groups or distribute it to the local community for free via the food waste app Olio to prevent good food from going to waste.” Olio said charities had priority in receiving collection slots. A FareShare spokesperson said that it was connected directly to 20 Tesco distribution centres helping it to provide food to thousands of charities across the country and the end of day surplus distribution from stores was in addition to that system. “Tesco has been instrumental in supporting FareShare’s mission to combat the environmental impact of food waste, ensuring good food goes to people, not waste,” the group said. The dispute with charities comes after Tesco found that thousands of tonnes of unwanted food it thought was going to feed animals had instead been used to generate energy, dramatically damaging its progress on reducing food waste.",

        "title": "Rejection of BHP’s second bid for Anglo American is unsurprising",
        "content": "BHP is “disappointed” that its second takeover offer for mining rival Anglo American has been rejected, but it cannot be surprised. The improved terms in the all-share proposal took the headline price from £31bn to £34bn but, since almost everybody agreed the original offer was several mineshafts short of full value, even a £3bn uplift wasn’t enough to put the defending board under serious pressure. The problem here for BHP is twofold. First, the advertised offer price of £27.53 for Anglo (the day-to-day value obviously fluctuates with BHP’s share price) may look pretty against the pre-action level of £22-ish, but we’re talking about long-life assets here. Anglo stood at £36 in January last year and, if only it could fix its current production headaches, it’s not too hard to imagine it getting close to that level in reasonable time under its own steam. Some outside assistance in the form of a pickup in the price of platinum would help, for starters. The second issue is the complex structure of BHP’s offer. It requires Anglo to demerge its two big South African units, one in platinum and the other in iron ore, which already have separate listings in Johannesburg. Only then would BHP’s offer for the bulk of the company – stretching from copper mines in Peru and Chile to metallurgical coal in Queensland to De Beers diamonds – proceed. The proposed model can be presented by BHP as politically savvy, since it would mean South African assets staying under local ownership, but from the point of view of Anglo’s shareholders a two-part transaction just looks messy. All the risk in securing a regulatory thumbs up for the South African demergers sits with Anglo, and there could be a hefty tax bill (some estimates say $2bn (£1.6bn)) at the end of the process. There will, of course, still be a takeover price at which Anglo’s board would be obliged to roll over and say the risks and uncertainties are worth accepting. Anglo’s current structure, after all, is hardly simple; and the benefit of a combo with BHP would be the bidder’s undoubted ability to ramp up investment. But logic still says the take-out price should involve more than just a conventional premium to compensate for the fussiness of the takeover structure. At the moment, BHP’s offer is just not in compelling territory. None of which gives Anglo’s board a free pass. The parallel promise from its boardroom on Monday was that the “accelerated plans” for a standalone future would follow on Tuesday. There’s nothing like a bid to accelerate a board’s thinking, but chairman Stuart Chambers needs to have something substantial to say, beyond a predictable promise to boost production. A good start would be to find some assets to sell to show the value within Anglo – some analysts suggest a prime candidate would be iron ore in Brazil. Whatever it is, the takeover defence needs to move the dial on shareholder expectations. Given the performance for investors over the past decade has been a series of disappointments, a pledge to carry on doing the same thing ain’t going to cut it.",

        "title": "Seeing is smelling: how even a picture of a lemon can sell products | Letter",
        "content": "As a longtime enthusiast of ambient scents in retail spaces I very much enjoyed Aimee Levitt’s article (‘It’s the brand speaking to you’: the scent firms making smells for Subway, Abercrombie and more, 8 May). However, it misses an important limitation of ambient scent: consumers can only smell it if they’re actually in or near the physical retail space, but most shopping is now done online where brands are unable to diffuse scents. I recently co-authored research revealing a simple yet effective way to create a sense of smell without using actual scents. We showed that simply including a picture of a scented object (for example, coffee beans or a rose) on a package or in an advertisement strongly evokes that scent in consumers’ minds. Some colleagues have dubbed this “smellising”. That imagined scent, in turn, influences consumers in much the same way as an actual scent. For example, most Method cleaning products come in transparent packages without any visual imagery. We showed that people are more likely to choose Method’s clementine-scented hand soap when the ad had a picture of clementines than when it didn’t. Additionally, the more strongly the picture induces consumers to “smellise” the scent, the more they like the product. For instance, consumers chose a dish soap with a picture of cut lemons on the label over one with a picture of whole lemons, because cut lemons are more evocative than whole lemons. As your article made clear, scent is powerful. And as our research reveals, “seeing is smelling”. Therefore, online retailers can also harness the power of smell in shoppers’ minds.

        "title": "Anglo American rejects second ‘highly unattractive’ takeover approach from BHP, worth £34bn – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to recap…. Anglo American has rejected a second takeover approach by Australian rival BHP that values the London-listed mining company at £34bn. BHP said that Anglo’s board had not engaged with its offer, which came after an initial £31bn offer was also rejected last month. Anglo rejected the second offer on Monday, BHP said. A takeover of Anglo, a member of the FTSE 100, would create a global player in markets for commodities including copper, potash, iron ore and metallurgical coal used for steelmaking. Copper is in high demand as a crucial raw material in the low-carbon energy transition because it is essential in manufacturing components for renewable energy projects and electric vehicles. Anglo American had said the initial offer “significantly undervalues” the company, but some shareholders have indicated they would be willing to consider a higher offer. BHP said it was disappointed by Anglo’s failure to engage… …but Anglo insisted that the structure of the deal was ‘highly unattractive’, and that it would provide a detailed investor update tomorrow. In other news: UK housebuilding slumped by 20% in the first quarter of this year, adding to the challenge of moving into the housing ladder. Affordability problems are forcing more young people take out ultra-long mortgages, which will run until they are in retirement…. …while renters are becoming more affluent as lower-income families are priced out of the market. The UK government has trimmed its stake in NatWest to below 27%, ahead of a share sale to the public this year. Output across the UK picked up in April, lifting hopes that the economy had turned a corner. The former UK chancellor Nadhim Zahawi is to become the chair of Very Group, the online retailer owned by the billionaire Barclay family, days after announcing that he would step down as a Conservative MP at the next general election. The Japanese tech investor SoftBank made a profit for the second consecutive quarter as it tries to turn its performance around before big planned investments in artificial intelligence. Lower income tenants are being priced out of the rental market as the cost of renting increases, according to analysts Capital Economics. Households in the private rental sector are getting richer, and not because people are “hutching” up, or deciding to couple up and rent together, boosting average incomes. Rents are shooting up because of stronger demand from two sources: first time buyers are having to rent for longer because mortgage rates are so high, and net migration has sharply increased, tripling compared to rates in the 2010s. Eight of ten new migrants rent in the private sector, the ONS has found. Analysts conclude that this is one reason for the rising number of people on the waiting list for social housing, in temporary accommodation or sleeping rough. Waiting lists for social housing rose to a decade high of 1.3 million in March this year, while there were similar increases in the number of people rough sleeping or in temporary accommodation. UK rents have risen faster than usual since 2022, eclipsing UK wage growth. Since 2022, pay growth has increased at the average annual rate of 5% a year while rents have shot up by 12% a year. BHP’s new offer for Anglo still falls short of expectations, says Jamie Maddock, energy and mining analyst at Quilter Cheviot: “BHP’s upwardly revised offer for Anglo still falls someway short of reasonable expectations. It appears to overlook the superior quality and the unique characteristics of Anglo’s portfolio of assets. Additionally, there are significant questions about the level of political support and the intricate nature of the proposed transaction. “With Anglo poised to reveal its standalone potential at the forthcoming investor update, the market will gain a far clearer understanding of the company’s true worth and future direction.” Shares in US electricals retailer Gamestop have more than doubled at the start of trading in New York, as meme stock fever grips Wall Street again. Gamestop’s shares have surged by 110% to $36.70, having closed at $17.46 on Friday night. As covered earlier, the rally appears to have been sparked by the return to social media of the man at the center of the pandemic meme stock craze of 2021. Keith Gill, better known as “Roaring Kitty,” made his first post on X (formerly Twitter) for three years on Sunday night, when he posted an image of a man sitting forward in his chair, a meme used by gamers when things are getting serious. Gill was the driving force behind the surge in Gamestop’s shares in 2021, when he published bullish analysis arguing that the company was undervalued. That triggered an intense short squeeze; it’s share price rose, hurting hedge funds and other speculators who had bet against it. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, points out that Gamestop’s shares are in their strongest performance since March 2021, at the peak of the meme stock craze. Brooks adds: Monday’s move in Game Stop rounds off a good month for the company, its stock price has surged more than 60% in the past month, fueled mostly by demand from retail traders. There has been no direct catalyst for this move. Its first quarter results were horrible: net income was down by $27.7mn, while earnings per share was negative by $0.09, suggesting that the company is not profitable. Thus, the move in the stock price in recent weeks, is not driven by fundamentals. This is one of the key risks of trading meme stocks – there is no clear driver aside from momentum and social media hype, which can reverse very quickly. It is worth keeping in mind that Game Stop is lower by more than 16% year to date. Stuart Chambers, chairman of Anglo American, says: “The latest proposal from BHP again fails to recognise the value inherent in Anglo American. Anglo American shareholders are well positioned to benefit from increasing demand from future enabling products while the increasing capital intensity to bring greenfield supply online makes proven assets with world class resource endowments ever more attractive. The Anglo American team is focused on delivering against its strategic priorities of operational excellence, portfolio simplification and growth and is set to accelerate delivery in order to unlock this inherent value. The BHP proposal also continues to have a highly unattractive structure. This leaves Anglo American, its shareholders and stakeholders disproportionately at risk from the substantial uncertainty and execution risk created by the proposed inter-conditional execution of two demergers and a takeover.” Anglo American adds that it has accelerated plans for delivery of its standalone strategy and will provide a detailed investor update on 14 May 2024. Newsflash: Anglo American has confirmed that has rejected a second takeover approach from BHP Group. In a statement to the City, Anglo says it received the “second unsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional combination” on 7 May (as BHP revealed about 90 minutes ago). Anglo says this offer “continues to significantly undervalue Anglo American and its future prospects”. Accordingly, the board of Anglo has unanimously rejected it. Anglo says it has conducted “extensive engagement” with its shareholders and stakeholders since the approach from BHP became public on 24 April 2024. It also continues to criticise the structure of the bid – under which it would distribute its shares in Anglo American Platinum Limited and Kumba Iron Ore Limited to its investors. Anglo says: Aside from significantly undervaluing Anglo American, the Latest Proposal continues to contemplate a structure which the Board believes is highly unattractive for Anglo American’s shareholders, given the uncertainty and complexity inherent, and significant execution risks. Ashwin Pillay, senior associate at law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, says: A second rejection from Anglo-American signals that the company is a hot commodity to global investors, showcasing the FTSE’s ongoing resilience. A combination of interest rate cuts, slowing inflation, and a depreciating pound have all led to a stellar performance by the FTSE 100. With a general election on the horizon amidst ongoing economic uncertainty, the question remains as to whether the FTSE can maintain its upward momentum, or whether it will continue being outstripped by markets in the US and Europe. We’re currently witnessing a surge in international M&amp;A activity, indicating a potential dynamic change in the global business environment that could redefine cross-border economic interactions. Industry analyst David McKay of Miningmx suggests Anglo is ready to start its takeover defence: The pressure is now on Anglo to show shareholders how it can deliver more value on its own, says Bloomberg, while BHP will need to improve its offer again for a deal to happen. Top executives of both companies are at a conference in Miami this week….. Newsflash: Mining giant BHP Group has made a second takeover offer for Anglo American, and been rebuffed again. BHP has told the City that it made its approach on 7 May (last Tuesday), and was “disappointed” to be given the thumbs down today. BHP says: The Revised Proposal was rejected by the Anglo American Board on 13 May 2024. BHP is disappointed that the Anglo American Board has chosen not to engage with BHP with respect to the Revised Proposal and the improved terms. BHP continues to believe that a combination of the two businesses would deliver significant value for all shareholders. BHP’s new proposal values Anglo American at £34bn, around three billion more than its initial offer of £31bn. The new all-share offer is worth £27.53 per Anglo American ordinary share, with BHP still proposing that Anglo sells its stakes in Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore, returning cash to shareholders. BHP’s original proposal was worth £25.08 a share. But since the deal came to light last month, Anglo’s shares had surged to around £28 this morning. Mike Henry, BHP chief executive officer, insists that the deal makes sense, saying: BHP and Anglo American are a strategic fit and the combination is a unique and compelling opportunity to unlock significant synergies by bringing together two highly complementary, world class businesses. The combined business would have a leading portfolio of high-quality assets in copper, potash, iron ore and metallurgical coal and BHP would bring its track record of operational excellence to maximise returns from these high-quality assets. Shares in Anglo American are now falling – they’re down 2% at £27.22. More property news: Asda has flagged plans to sell and leaseback further sites after teaming up with property developer Barratt to build more than 1,500 homes as part of a redevelopment of its 10-acre supermarket site in Park Royal, north west London. The heavily indebted company, which has previously been involved in plans for building homes above stores in Basildon and the Isle of Dogs in London, said the Park Royal plan was a first of a kind as it involved the sale of the site’s freehold under the condition that homes would be built and Asda would leaseback its store site at a peppercorn rent. If planning permission is granted, the development is intended to create a new town centre for the area and include about 500 affordable homes. Previous mixed-use developments have been in relation to leasehold stores. Ian Lawrence, head of mixed-use developments at Asda, said: “By working with leading developers like Barratt London, we are able to maximise the full potential of our property portfolio for the first time.” “We are also unlocking further opportunities to release value from our extensive property portfolio, which can be reinvested back into the business to fund other initiatives and support our long-term growth ambition to become the UK’s second largest supermarket chain.” The National House Building Council (NHBC) is optimistic that housebuilding will pick up this year following its Q1 slump – as the economic picture improves. Steve Wood, CEO at NHBC, explains: “Build volumes are anticipated to rise in the second half of the year as economic conditions begin to improve and consumer confidence starts to recover. Any new home-buyer incentives ahead of the general election would also have a positive impact on house-building activity. “We are seeing early signs of growth returning to the private sector, and affordable house building is holding up well, but skills and planning challenges must be addressed to truly accelerate market recovery.” In terms of house types, there were declines of 43% in new bungalow registrations. In comparison, construction of terraced properties fell by 26%, while detached homes were down 24%. Apartment registrations saw the lowest fall (-12%) due to “the relative strength of the rental and affordable sector”, NHBC says. The biggest drops in new home registrations were recorded in East Midlands (-43% year-on-year), Wales (-43%) and North West and Merseyside (-41%). Registrations were up in London (+2%), Scotland (+4%) and Norther Ireland and the Isle Of Man (+23%), NHBC report. UK housebuilding activity tumbled in the first quarter of this year, new industry data shows, as high interest rates and wet weather hit the construction sector. A total of 21,967 new homes were registered to be built in the first quarter of this year, the National House Building Council (NHBC) reports today, a 20% tumble on the 27,619 registered in Q1 2023. The slump reflects ‘prevailing market conditions’, says Steve Wood, CEO at NHBC, including the series of storms that dampened the UK this year. Wood explains: Rises in the Bank of England’s base rate have driven mortgage rates higher, leading to a drop in new home purchases and a slowdown in house price growth. Prolonged wet weather has also hampered house building output in Q1, with the south of England experiencing its wettest February since 1836, according to the Met Office, and many parts of southern England recording well over twice the average rainfall. Wood adds that house builders are “cautiously optimistic”, poinging out that registrations have increased month-on-month since January. Last Friday’s GDP report showed that UK construction sector shrank by 0.9% in the first quarter of this year, lagging behind the wider economy which grew by 0.6%. There’s a flurry of meme stock excitement in the markets again today. Shares in Gamestop, the electronics retailer, have surged by over 19% in pre-market trading, rekindling memories of its surge in early 2021 when small traders took on Wall Street investors who had short-sold its stock. The rally comes after the analyst who sparked the Gamestop short squeeze, Keith Gill, made his first online post through his Roaring Kitty persona in three years. Gill tweeted a meme of a man holding a smartphone leaning forward in an intent pose – which is being taken as a sign that something may be afoot…. A Solana memecoin called $GME, created to mark the Gamestop drama, has surged by around 500%. The UK government’s stake in NatWwest has dipped again – just as a US investor builds up a stake. The government’s holding has now fallen to 26.95%, due to its ongoing trading plan through which UK Government Investments (UKGI) has been trimming its stake. UKGI is still NatWest’s biggest shareholder; it stopped holding a controlling stake in March when its holding fell below 30%. The stake dates back to the rescue of Royal Bank of Scotland, as NatWest was then called, in 2008 – which left the government owning 86% of the bank. The government is hoping to sell its stake to the public this summer. The Guardian reported yesterday that Los Angeles-headquartered Capital Group, which is one of the world’s oldest and largest investment firms, with more than £2.5tn under management, has bought more than £110m worth of NatWest shares, pushing the group into the bank’s top 30 shareholder list. A cut to UK interest rates next month is now more likely than not, according to the money markets. LSEG data this morning shows there is a 54% chance that the Bank of England lowers base rate to 5% at its June meeting, and a 46% chance that it leaves rates on hold at 5.25%. Last week, BoE governor Andrew Bailey told reporters that a June rate cut was neither “ruled out” nor a “fait accompli” – it would depend whether economic data showed inflation was falling sustainably to its 2% target. Last week, a June rate cut was basically a coin-toss, with ‘no change’ slightly more likely…. The money markets also suggest that a rate cut by August is fully priced in, and that the BoE will manage a second cut to 4.75% by December. Back in the UK housing market, borrowers are being squeezed by rising mortgage rates. New data from Moneyfacts shows that the average two- and five-year fixed mortgage rates rose in April. Mortgage rates increased as the City dialled back its expectations for interest rate cuts, with just two quarter-point reductions expected this year. That prompted several major lenders to raise their rates Moneyfacts reports: The overall average two- and five-year fixed rates rose between the start of April and the start of May, to 5.91% and 5.48% respectively. The average two-year fixed rate stands 0.43% higher than the five-year equivalent, the biggest difference seen in six months (November 2023 – 0.43%). The average ‘revert to’ rate or Standard Variable Rate (SVR) remained at 8.18%, just shy of the highest recorded (8.19%) during November and December 2023. The average two-year tracker variable mortgage fell to 6.12%. Jobcentre security guards across the UK are on strike today in a dispute over pay, PA Media reports. The GMB said more than 1,000 of its members employed by G4S for the Department for Work and Pensions walked out for the day. The union said more than two thirds of the guards are paid the minimum wage. Eamon O’Hearn, GMB national officer, said: “Jobcentre security guards are eking out a living on just above the minimum wage, despite facing horrific violence and abuse while on the job. “G4S can afford to pay these workers what they deserve, unless they do they are going to face a prolonged period of industrial action.” A G4S spokesman said: “We’re disappointed that the GMB have refused to take our improved pay offer to their members. “We are continuing to try to reach an amicable agreement, and have implemented contingency plans to minimise disruption to our customers.” The London stock market could soon get a boost, if Cambridge-based computer company Raspberry Pi chooses to float in the City. The Sunday Times reported that Raspberry Pi could be valued at up to £500m, and could float within the next 10 days (unless the current sunny market conditions deteriorate). The first Raspberry Pi was launched in 2012 – it’s a very small, very cheap and very powerful computer, which aims to help children learn to code. It was created as a philanthropic effort to create a modern equivalent of the BBC Micro, which helped an earlier generation of children get a BASIC grasp of computers (and very exciting it was too!). By the end of 2019 Raspberry Pi had sold 30 million units. If Raspberry Pi does float in London, it could help the stock exchange shake off its reputation as a Jurasssic Park with few tech companies to boast of. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: It’s been a challenging period on the IPO front and the City has been pedalling hard to attract new IPOs, with help from the government’s listing rules shake up, but it’s been an uphill struggle. However, London’s recent record run is likely to help instil more confidence that investors will greet new listings with enthusiasm. Clinching the Raspberry Pi floatation would be a coup, particularly given the reputation the UK is trying to foster as a breeding ground for tech startups. Heathrow Airport has accused the government of curtailing the UK’s global connectivity through bad policies. In its latest traffic update, Heathrow says the government is failing to support UK aviation and help it compete globally. It says: Initiatives like the introduction of unnecessary visas for transiting passengers, the absence of tax-free shopping and the recently proposed hike in business rates, underscore the need for Ministers to take a cross-Government approach to policymaking that supports UK aviation’s global competitiveness. Last month, Heathrow urged ministers to scrap a new £10 charge for overseas travellers using UK airports to connect to other flights. Despite these problems, Heathrow reports that it handled 6.7m passengers in April, bringing the total for the year so far up to 25.2 million. It says it “remains on-track” for a record-breaking number of passengers in 2024. Friday 19 April was its busiest day since the pandemic, with 1,337 flights. Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye says: As we continue to grow, our focus is on making Heathrow fit for the future, delivering reliable journeys for all our customers today and getting ready for the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow. But to unlock our full potential to help grow the country’s economy, we need the Government to implement policies that support UK aviation’s ability to compete globally, and thus make the UK more competitive overall. Trading in the City of London has begun cautiously, with the blue-chip FTSE 100 rising by 6 points or 0.08% to 8440. On Friday night it hit a new intraday high of 8,455 points, before ending at a new closing high amid relief that the UK economy had left recession. Distribution group Diploma are the top riser, up 6.5% to a record high, after it upgraded its revenue and profit warning forecasts for this year. Former UK chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has become the chair of one of Britain’s biggest online retailers, just days after announcing he will step down from parliament at the next election. The Very Group, which operates digital retailers Very and Littlewoods and is owned by the Barclay family, has announced that they have appointed Zahawi as non-executive chair and board member. Zahawi will replace current non-executive chair Aidan Barclay, who took on the job on a temporary basis back in February. Zahawi, currently MP for Stratford-on-Avon, announced last week that he will stand down as an MP at the next election, declaring “My mistakes have been mine.” Those mistakes include failing to declare that HMRC were investigating his tax affairs – a breach of the ministerial code, leading to his dismissal as chancellor. Yesterday, Zahawi admitted for the first time he paid nearly £5m to the tax authority to settle his tax affairs. Zahawi, who also served as vaccine minister in the pandemic, also co-founded polling company YouGov. Aidan Barclay says he’s an ideal candidate to lead the Very board, explaining: “I am delighted to welcome Nadhim to the Board of The Very Group. With a proven track record in digital growth and innovation, and highly respected in the UK and global markets, he is ideally suited to lead our Board as the company enters its next stage of strategic development and growth.” “The Great Resignation” that gripped the UK economy is over, according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). CIPD’s latest Labour Market Outlook report has found that 55% of employers are looking to maintain their current staff level - the highest level since winter 2016/17 – rather than taking on more workers to handle increased demand. Instead, CIPD reports that the UK labour market is now less dynamic and competitive, leading more workers to stick with their currrent jobs rather than risk a move. James Cockett, labour market economist for the CIPD, says “When the economy reopened post-pandemic, turnover and vacancy levels rose in response to the hot recruitment market. Now, the so-called ‘Great Resignation’ is well and truly over and has been replaced by ‘The Big Stay’, with more people opting for job stability. Falling staff turnover and vacancies also mean the balance of power in the labour market is moving in the direction of employers and away from workers. “Based on the trends in our report, there’s likely to be further falls in both turnover and vacancy levels in 2024. Employers will need to look forward and factor in this lower attrition when making decisions around staffing levels and the future of their workforce. We are now entering a more stable period, as recruitment trends bounce back to pre-pandemic levels. The report also found that British employers expect to raise wages by 4% over the coming 12 months. That would still mean a rise in real wages, as inflation is expected to fall to around 2% this spring. A former pensions minister has warned that young home buyers are being forced to gamble with their retirement prospects by taking on ultra-long mortgages. Steve Webb is concerned that 42% of new mortgages agreed in the fourth quarter of 2023 - or 91,394 - had terms going beyond the state pension age. That’s up from 31% in the last quarter of 2021. Many of those loans are being taken out by 30- to 39-year-olds, who would typically be expected to be taking out their first mortgage, or those in their 40s. Demand for such long loans has increased following the rise in mortgage rates; taking out a longer loan lowers the monthly repayment cost (even though the total interest bill may end up higher). Webb, a partner at the pension consultants LCP, obtained the data via a freedom of information request to the Bank of England. He says the number of mortgages set to run past state pension age is “shocking,” and may make it harder for people in retirement. Webb explains: “The challenge of getting on the housing ladder is forcing large numbers of young homebuyers to gamble with their retirement prospects by taking on ultra-long mortgages. “We already know that millions of people are not saving enough for their retirement and if some of that limited retirement saving has to be used to clear a mortgage balance at retirement they will be at even greater risk of poverty in old age. Serious questions need to be asked of mortgage lenders as to whether this lending is really in the borrower’s best interests.” Here’s the full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Having exited out of recession strongly last Friday, the UK economy appears to have turned the corner after a tough couple of years. The latest Business Trends report, released by accounting and business advisory firm BDO this morning, shows that output rose last month to its highest level in almost two years. BDO reports that UK business output and confidence rose in April, as the inflation pressures that have dogged firms for months ease. This upturn has pushed up BDO’s output index by 2.09 points to 103.92 in April – the highest level since May 2022. The UK’s services sector led the bounceback in April, says BDO, thanks to consumers having more money to spend at hospitality, retail and leisure companies as energy bills fall. Hopes of a cut to UK interest rates by the autumn helped lift business confidence. Last week, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said it was “likely” that Bank Rate will be cut over the coming quarters, after the BoE left rates on hold again. Worryingly, though, BDO’s employment index fell for the 10th month running, to its lowest level since February 2013, suggesting the UK jobs market is cooling. Kaley Crossthwaite, partner at BDO, says: “Cautious optimism is the order of the day for UK businesses hoping for an interest rate cut this summer. “It’s heartening to see a turning point begin to materialise for the economy, with the services sector driving the bounce back so far from last year’s technical recession. But businesses across the board need more certainty from the government and we urge them to provide a clear, stable and long-term tax roadmap as soon as they’re able to, alongside much needed reforms to the apprenticeship levy. Only once businesses have this will we start to see the more stable optimism, investment and hiring intentions needed for a robust recovery.” The latest Regional PMI survey data from NatWest confirm that business activity continued to rise across almost all UK nations and regions last month. London saw the fastest growth, followed by the West Midlands and Northern Ireland. Yorkshire &amp; Humber was the only area where activity fell. Firms across the UK also reported a rise in cost inflation last month, driven by a rise in staff pay (partly due to the rise in the minimum wage at the start of April). Sebastian Burnside, NatWest chief economist, explains: “Most areas of the UK are enjoying a revival in business activity, with growth even accelerating in most cases in April. “Yorkshire &amp; Humber is the one area where we are yet to see the economy kick into gear, though the region’s firms are optimistic about their prospects for the coming year, as is the case across the UK.

        "title": "Anglo American rejects new £34bn offer from mining rival BHP",
        "content": "Anglo American has rejected a second takeover approach by its Australian rival BHP that values the London-listed mining company at £34bn. BHP said Anglo’s board had not engaged with its offer, which came after an initial £31bn offer was also rejected last month. Anglo rejected the second offer on Monday, BHP said. A takeover of Anglo, a member of the FTSE 100, would create a global player in markets for commodities including copper, potash, iron ore and metallurgical coal used for steelmaking. It would be the biggest takeover ever in the mining sector, and a large deal at a time when mergers and acquisitions have slowed. Copper in particular is in high demand as a crucial raw material in the low-carbon energy transition because it is essential in manufacturing components for renewable energy projects and electric vehicles. Anglo American’s key assets are copper mines in Peru and Chile. Anglo American responded to BHP’s statement on Monday by saying that the latest offer “continues to significantly undervalue Anglo American and its future prospects” and that the board “unanimously rejected” the second proposal. The offer will increase pressure on Anglo American’s boss, Duncan Wanblad, to reveal plans to improve Anglo American’s performance and persuade shareholders that the company would be better off staying independent. Anglo said it would provide a detailed investor update of its “standalone strategy” on Tuesday. The new all-share offer is worth £27.53 for each Anglo American ordinary share, with BHP still proposing that Anglo sells its stakes in Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore, returning cash to shareholders. Anglo said the requirement from BHP to demerge the two businesses as part of a deal was “highly unattractive for Anglo American’s shareholders, given the uncertainty and complexity inherent, and significant execution risks”. BHP said it was a 50% premium to the value of the Anglo American assets it wants before the approach became public. BHP’s original proposal was worth £25.08 a share. But since the deal came to light last month, Anglo’s shares had surged to about £28 on Monday morning. Shares in Anglo were down 0.5% at £27.58 after BHP announced that a second bid had been rejected. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, BHP said: “BHP is disappointed that the Anglo American board has chosen not to engage with BHP with respect to the revised proposal and the improved terms. BHP continues to believe that a combination of the two businesses would deliver significant value for all shareholders.” BHP has until 22 May to make a firm offer or walk away under UK takeover rules. Mike Henry, the BHP chief executive, said: “BHP put forward a revised proposal to the Anglo American board that we strongly believe would be a win-win for BHP and Anglo American shareholders. We are disappointed that this second proposal has been rejected. “BHP and Anglo American are a strategic fit and the combination is a unique and compelling opportunity to unlock significant synergies by bringing together two highly complementary, world-class businesses.”",

        "content": "A “terrible IT problem” is behind empty shelves at some Woolworths stores in Queensland. In scenes reminiscent of the panic buying of the early Covid pandemic, some Woolworths chains have been stripped of fruit and vegetables. Paul Harker, the chief commercial officer, speaking at the Queensland parliament’s inquiry into supermarket pricing, said the problem came down to a “warehouse management system upgrade” that had gone wrong. He said the problem had led to delays in getting stock to stores across Brisbane and south-east Queensland. “We’ve had a terrible IT problem,” Harker said, adding it had caused “carnage”. “We’re not particularly happy about the situation,” he said. “We’re working very hard to improve it. We apologise to our customers that we have had issues. “I might add we’re continuing to take the committed stock from our suppliers, even if we can’t get it out.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Harker said any unused stock sitting in warehouses would be donated to food bank and other charities, to ensure they do not go to waste. “Certainly, our heartfelt apologies [go] to our customers that may have been disappointed when they came in … to buy something that’s not on the shelf.” A spokesperson for Woolworths told Guardian Australia the issue had affected multiple distribution centres in Brisbane. “Orders to some of our Queensland stores have been delayed due to operational issues at one of our distribution centres in Brisbane. “Some stores may be stocking less fruit and vegetables, milk and chicken than usual. Product purchase limits are not in place,” they said. Users took to social media to complain about the empty shelves. In a Facebook group dedicated to news in the Redlands area in Brisbane, Hugh O’Neill said it was “weird” to see the empty shelves. “Weird to see so many empty shelves at Woolies in Birkdale. Supply issues ????,” he wrote. User Stephen Wilson commented, saying “Cleveland’s was a ghost town on veggies”. The Woolworths spokesperson said they expected to see some improvements in supply levels “in the coming days”.",

        "content": "The Japanese tech investor SoftBank made a profit for the second consecutive quarter as it tries to turn its performance around before big planned investments in artificial intelligence. SoftBank reported net income of 231bn yen (£1.18bn) in the first three months of 2024, compared with a 57.6bn yen loss in the same period last year, according to financial results published on Monday. The quarterly gain was not enough to offset losses over the rest of its financial year, leaving the Japanese investor with its third annual loss – at 227bn yen – in the 12 months to the end of March. SoftBank also made big gains on its investments, including in the UK-headquartered chip designer Arm, which investors hope will be the centrepiece of a new AI-focused strategy led by the chief executive, Masayoshi Son. Gains in the value of Arm do not feed through into SoftBank’s profits, because it is a subsidiary, but the price of shares listed on New York’s Nasdaq stock exchange is up by 60% so far in 2024. Nikkei Asia on Sunday reported that Arm plans to develop AI chips in the hope of launching its first products in 2025. Son built SoftBank into one of the world’s most prominent investors via bets on internet services, including China’s e-commerce site Alibaba, and also notably as a mobile phone distributor. The outspoken executive used his investment gains to make a series of increasingly bold bets on tech companies, and obtained Saudi Arabia’s backing for its tech-focused SoftBank Vision Funds. During the coronavirus pandemic tech boom the valuations of its companies soared, but after the bubble burst SoftBank has gone through a period of retrenchment, even if Son’s belief in rapid technological advances remains undimmed. SoftBank last week led a $1bn (£800m) funding round into British autonomous driving tech company Wayve, while Bloomberg has reported that it is in talks to acquire British AI chipmaker Graphcore. SoftBank had been expected to slip back into a loss for the most recent quarter, but remaining in profit could make it easier for Son to justify further large investments. However, the Saudi-backed Vision Funds did not perform as well as SoftBank’s other investments during the first three months of the year. They dropped in value by 115bn yen, most notably because of WeWork, the office rental company that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US in November and which Son had vocally and expensively backed.",

        "title": "Jacob Rees-Mogg accuses Bank of England of ‘miserable incompetence’ over inflation",
        "content": "Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused the Bank of England of “miserable incompetence” over its failure to reduce inflation more quickly and its bond-selling strategy, as rightwing Tories prepare to renew their attacks on the Bank’s independence. The former business secretary accused the Bank of damaging the economy with its interest rate decisions and costing the taxpayer tens of billions of pounds by selling off government debt too quickly in an attempt to reduce its balance sheet – a policy known as quantitative tightening (QT). His comments came as members of Conservative Way Forward, a Thatcherite group of Tory MPs, prepared to launch a report that once more called into question the Bank’s independence, echoing criticism levied at the bank by the former prime minister Liz Truss. Rees-Mogg said: “Quantitative tightening is not part of the Bank’s independent monetary strategy. It is a joint policy between it and the government funded by tax. This year it could cost £46bn because the Bank has failed again. “Its miserable incompetence allowed inflation to peak at almost six times its target rate and now it is demanding higher taxes because of its hopeless bond trading strategy. It makes Nick Leeson, who bankrupted [the London-based bank] Barings, look clever.” The Bank of England has been contacted for comment. Relations between the Bank and the right of the Tory party have been fractious since Liz Truss’s short tenure in Downing Street, during which she considered sacking its top bosses, she later admitted. Many Conservatives have criticised the Bank for not raising interest rates more quickly, a decision they said had led to monetary policymakers having to keep them higher for longer than in other countries. The Bank decided last week to keep the base rate at 5.25%. Truss’s allies have since called for decisions on interest rates to be handed back to ministers, more than 25 years after they were taken out of the reach of government by Gordon Brown. On Tuesday members of Conservative Way Forward will call for a review into the Bank’s independence as part of a report that focuses on the losses made by the Bank’s quantitative tightening policy. Like other central banks, the Bank of England began buying up government debt in the wake of the 2008 crash in an attempt to stimulate the economy. It is now seeking to undo those purchases, in part to give it more room to repeat them in the event of another financial crisis. Unlike other central banks, however, the Bank has decided not to let the bonds it holds expire naturally, but instead to sell them into the private market more quickly, with any losses incurred being footed by the taxpayer. Earlier this year, Harriett Baldwin, the chair of the cross-party Treasury select committee, called the policy a “leap in the dark for the British economy”. Tuesday’s report will deepen the pressure on the Bank to change course. The report’s authors highlight a recent forecast by the Bank that it will make a cashflow loss in 2024 of £46bn, pointing out such an amount of money would cover the daily budgets of the five of the government’s biggest departments combined. Greg Smith, the chair of Conservative Way Forward, said: “The Bank of England is pursuing a QT policy that is out of step with what the world’s major central banks are doing, and this is causing huge losses to the taxpayer.” A spokesperson for the Bank said: “Up until September 2022, the Bank sent £123.9bn to HM Treasury, and it was always recognised that payments would reverse in future. “The Bank also pays billions of pounds in seigniorage income [the difference between what it costs to produce currency and how much the currency is worth] from the issuance of banknotes to the Treasury, which other central banks retain to balance their books. “Future payments are highly uncertain and stopping active sales won’t necessarily change the lifetime profit or loss of the Asset Purchase Faciility.”",

        "content": "BT has said it is increasingly using artificial intelligence to help it detect and neutralise threats from hackers targeting business customers amid repeated attacks on companies. The £10.5bn group is aiming to build up its business protecting customers from online criminals and has patented technology that uses AI to analyse attack data to allow companies to protect their tech infrastructure. British businesses are routinely facing hacking attempts, and some recent high-profile victims have included including the outsourcer Capita, Royal Mail and British Airways. BT has 725 AI-related patents and patent applications in Europe, the US and China. Bas Burger, the chief executive of BT Business, the division of BT dealing with business customers, said: “We have all this data around when criminals try to attack, such as time of day, what type of attack, and we have suppliers to help us with the information … all data we enrich and then we have a piece of AI running across it.” He said the technology, called Eagle-i, which was launched in 2021, could suggest what kind of policies needed to be implemented in a firewall to make sure they were protected against a specific type of attack in the future. BT is also using AI to help detect and establish the cause of faults across its network. This is helping to improve fix times by finding faults that might have taken much longer to identify in the past. Burger said the pace of technological change had prompted concerns among some companies about whether they were choosing the right technology as well as anxiety about the potential disruption that implementing new technology would cause to their business. BT recently conducted a study of 2,000 business leaders and found that 86% of company directors and executives report technology as a source of stress as they seek to modernise their businesses. The study showed that 88% of businesses were investing in new technology this year in an attempt to improve productivity and gain a competitive advantage, and overall tech investment was up 31% year on year. “Every business today is a digital business,” Burger said. “They all want to use technology and they are increasing investment … The flip side is everyone is getting anxious about this. The tempo of innovation is increasing, which in itself gives a lot of business leaders anxiety about ‘what should I do?’. It’s like changing an aeroplane engine while the aeroplane is flying – you’re anxious because the aeroplane is in the air.” BT is increasingly pushing into AI and last year announced that about 10,000 jobs would be replaced by the technology as part of a wider push to cut its workforce by as much as 55,000 by 2030. The company will report its annual results on Thursday, with underlying profits expected to come in just below £8bn, according to analysts.",

        "title": "Founder of Hipgnosis Songs Fund accuses ex-partner over failed business",
        "content": "The founder of a music company that holds the rights to songs by Blondie and Justin Bieber has accused his former business partner of using the proceeds of fraud to fund their collapsed venture, court documents show. Merck Mercuriadis is the founder of Hipgnosis Songs Fund (HSF), a FTSE 250 company that buys music rights in the hope of profiting from streaming revenues, and which is now set to be taken over by private equity investor Blackstone in a £1.3bn deal. However, that company is not Mercuriadis’s first attempt to buy up music streaming rights – or the first time he has used the Hipgnosis name. His co-founders of the now dissolved business, Hipgnosis Music Limited (HML), have brought a £200m legal action in the high court in London, claiming that Mercuriadis stole the idea from them and made millions listing it on the London stock exchange in 2018. Mercuriadis said the claim was “as opportunistic as it is unmeritorious”, in a filing detailing his defence against the claim. He has alleged that finance for the first Hipgnosis came from a complex fraud against Swedish pension funds, of which he was unaware. The claim also names HSF and its investment adviser as defendants. Both are also defending the claim. The idea behind Hipgnosis was to buy up rights to music from famous artists and writers that would continue to be streamed for years. The company could pay out dividends to investors, while musicians would be happy to sell the rights in exchange for a big upfront payment rather than waiting for listeners over the course of years. Mercuriadis is a former manager of acts including Elton John, Iron Maiden, Guns N’ Roses and Beyoncé. He appears to have held a long affinity for the word Hipgnosis, which was first the name of a graphic design group that produced album covers for the likes of Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Paul McCartney. Mercuriadis set up a personal services company in 2009, with the blessing of the design group’s founder – who also sold him an upside down elephant logo that is still in use. The listed Hipgnosis venture has been in turmoil for months after rising interest rates and concerns that it had overpaid for rights prompted investors last year to vote against it continuing. That led to a bidding war between Blackstone and a rival, Concord Music. However, the listed company’s tumultuous time in the spotlight of the London stock market does not match that of Mercuriadis’s first effort. At a 2014 meeting in Los Angeles, the heart of the US showbiz industry, Mercuriadis shared the rights buyout idea with his then friends, producer Aeon Manahan and Swedish musician manager Afram Gergeo. Mercuriadis would bring his music industry contacts and nous – which he clearly valued. In his defence, Mercuriadis’s lawyers wrote: “At the time of meeting, Mr Mercuriadis had significantly greater experience – and had achieved significantly greater success – in the music industry than both Mr Manahan and Mr Gergeo.” In return, Gergeo and another businessman, Emil Ingmanson, would bring financing through an investment fund they had set up. However, Mercuriadis “did not know – but he now understands – that the finance proposed for the new business was likely to be the proceeds of crime”, the filing alleged. He said he first learned of concerns about Ingmanson in October 2016, when a friend informed him of media reports about the growing Swedish pension fund scandal. It was only in March 2017 that he himself searched online and found that Ingmanson and Gergeo were under investigation by Swedish authorities, the filing said. Gergeo and Ingmanson were arrested in England in December 2017. Ingmanson went on the run before being arrested in Hungary and extradited to Sweden. He was sentenced to six years and nine months in prison in 2020. Gergeo was sentenced to nine months for “money laundering and fraud offences” in March 2021, according to the filing. The claim against Mercuriadis said he took a “maturing business opportunity” and transferred it to a new company. However, Mercuriadis alleged that the arrests and convictions “irretrievably doomed” the original Hipgnosis’s business prospects, making it impossible to raise funds to buy song rights. By the time it was dissolved, HML had started negotiations with only two artists. It reached a £11.6m deal with Wayne Hector, a songwriter for Nicki Minaj, One Direction and Westlife, among others, but failed to find the money and lost out to a rival. It also started negotiations with the Isley Brothers, an American group who first rose to prominence in the 1950s with their single Shout. HML alleged that it had also agreed a deal for consultancy services with Nile Rodgers, the Chic guitarist and a close friend of Mercuriadis, and Terius Nash, the songwriter known as The-Dream, whose hits include Rihanna’s Umbrella and Beyoncé’s Partition. However, Mercuriadis claimed that those agreements were either not completed or not binding. A lawyer for HML said the company was “very confident” in its case, and its position was that there was “compelling evidence that Mr Mercuriadis dishonestly diverted the music catalogues business opportunity”. The lawyer added: “The key components of Mr Mercuriadis’ defence are materially inaccurate and/or irrelevant and designed to divert attention away from his own unlawful conduct.” HML’s representatives also claimed that “there is compelling evidence that Mr Mercuriadis was aware that Mr Gergeo was under investigation and saw this as no bar to the business succeeding”. A response to the defence is due at the end of this month, but the case may not come to trial for a year or more. Mercuriadis, HSF and its investment adviser declined to comment.",

        "title": "British asparagus back in supermarkets after criticism over imports",
        "content": "Shoppers angered by discovering imported asparagus on supermarket shelves during the short British season for the vegetable are expected to receive a fillip after a sudden burst of sunshine helped the domestic crop. Supermarket shoppers had complained after finding asparagus grown in mainland Europe and the Americas on sale during the “peak” British season. The traditional asparagus season officially starts on 23 April, St George’s Day, but leading up to that date, the weather was “frustratingly cold” and “slowed it up”, leaving far-flung imports taking their place in supermarkets, said Chris Chinn, the chair of the Asparagus Growers Association. But that is about to change after last week’s run of sunny days helped the domestic asparagus crop “grow like stink” to produce a bumper crop “flush”. Chinn predicted that homegrown asparagus would be “everywhere” now. “It took until the bank holiday weekend for the warmth [in the ground] to come back,” he said. “The spears are like little thermometers.” Asparagus requires a soil temperature of at least 10C to grow, and if the conditions are right, it can grow up to 10cm in one day. “All the buds are ready and waiting, and you get a bit of warmth on it and it really erupts,” said Chinn, a partner at Britain’s largest asparagus growers, Cobrey Farms, based in the Wye Valley. “You can grow a spear a day in these conditions.” It is now possible to buy British asparagus, usually grown in polytunnels on the south coast, as early as February. However, the main outdoor crop is traditionally ready towards the end of April and hits its stride in May. The season typically concludes on 21 June. Shoppers noticed that the British supply seemed patchy this year. While Marks &amp; Spencer’s asparagus has been 100% British since April, rival stores are selling a mix, including imports from big producers such as Peru and Mexico as well as Italy and Spain. Jake Fiennes posted a picture of Co-op asparagus that hailed from Peru, stating: “This is so wrong as it’s peak UK asparagus season.” The Co-op explained that the cold snap had delayed the arrival of its asparagus supply, grown in Sussex, and that from Monday it would be “100% British”. It said: “As a longstanding supporter of British farmers and growers, championing homegrown produce on our shelves when in season is important to our member owners and us. “We currently have British asparagus in stores, which will move to 100% British from Monday. This is slightly later than usual due to the colder weather conditions in the UK over the past months, which delayed crop growth.” Waitrose said it had enjoyed a strong early season of British asparagus from February to early May but the core season had been delayed. “We are now in full UK season supply, which, for this week and next is looking strong. That said, it’s been incredibly challenging for our asparagus growers and they have been doing all they can to combat the colder temperatures and unseasonably heavy rainfall.” It is shaping up to be a year to forget for farmers who battled record-breaking rain during the winter only to be hindered by wet and cold spring weather. Many farms have been left flooded, leaving swaths of crops damaged and fields unable to be planted. As a result, asparagus is not the only crop arriving later than usual, with the British strawberry season delayed by a fortnight to the end of this month. However, strawberry growers say the hold-up meant the berries had ripened and flowered more gradually, resulting in unusually large, juicy fruits.",

        "content": "It was pitched as the place where the world’s leading technologists, scientists and philosophers would gather to figure out how effective altruism and artificial intelligence could be combined to create a global force to eradicate poverty and improve everyone’s lives. The Effective Ventures Foundation (EVF), which defines effective altruism as “using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible”, decided £14.9m of its cash would be best spent buying Wytham Abbey, a 15th-century Grade-I listed manor house near Oxford. The 27-bedroom house, which has over the years been visited by Queen Elizabeth I, Oliver Cromwell and Queen Victoria, was transformed into a retreat for believers in the movement, including the now-jailed FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, the billionaire Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and the Estonian billionaire Jaan Tallinn, who made a fortune investing early in Skype. However, just two years after buying the mansion, which acquired the nickname “Effective Altruism Castle”, the EVF has put it up for sale for £15m. The foundationbought the abbey with grants from Open Philanthropy, the funding organisation co-founded by Moskovitz. The proceeds will be used to “support high-impact charities”, it said. It comes soon after the EVF’s parent group, Effective Ventures, announced it had paidnearly $27m to the creditors of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange founded and run by Bankman-Fried. The FTX founder was jailed in March for 25 years over his role in the fraudulent collapse of the company. Zachary Robinson, the chief executive of Effective Ventures US, said the US and UK branches had reached collective settlements with the FTX estate. “As part of these settlements, EV US and EV UK have between them paid the estate $26.8m, an amount equal to 100% of the funds the entities received from FTX and the FTX Foundation in 2022. We strongly condemn fraud and the actions underlying Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction.” In its short tenure as the claimed global centre for promoting effective altruism and AI, Wytham Abbey has hosted only a handful of workshops, including “Pluralisms in Existential Risk”, “AI Fables” and “What is the nature of goal-directed agency and its implications for AI alignment?”. The mansion, which is being marketed by Savills, sits in 9.3 hectares (23 acres) of gardens, woodland and parkland in the Wytham conservation area near Oxford. “Although grand and surrounded by extensive grounds, the setting belies the abbey’s location, just three miles from Oxford,” the agent said. “Whether continuing as a residential events venue or as a family residence, it offers great flexibility.” A spokesperson for Effective Ventures said: “EV agreed with the abbey’s major donors at the time of the original purchase that they could recommend that EV sell the property if they believed there were higher-impact uses of the asset. “They made that recommendation this year, and the EV boards made the decision to sell the property and use the proceeds from the sale to support high-impact charities.”",

        "title": "South Korean state-owned nuclear developer in talks to build UK plant",
        "content": "South Korea’s state-owned nuclear developer has discussed building a multibillion-pound power plant in Wales with the UK government, it has emerged. Kepco, the largest utility provider in South Korea, has held early-stage discussions with Westminster officials about developing the Wylfa Newydd site on the island of Anglesey (Ynys Môn), the Financial Times reported. The energy minister Andrew Bowie is expected to meet representatives from the company this week to discuss the matter as part of the annual UK civil energy dialogue talks between the UK and South Korea. The government is aiming to revive the project as part of its plans to generate 24 gigawatts of energy from nuclear by 2050, a significant increase from the 6GW currently produced. It was initially hoped that the Japanese developer Hitachi would build two reactors on the site, but Hitachi pulled out in early 2019 because of rising costs, throwing the site’s future into doubt. In March this year the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, confirmed that the UK government had reached a £160m agreement with Hitachi to buy Wylfa and the site of the Oldbury plant in Gloucestershire, with the hope of finding new investors. One industry source told the FT: “Kepco is certainly interested in the project and the company is in talks with the UK government about it.” A UK official briefed on the matter said talks were at an early stage. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “Wylfa has excellent potential and we welcome the interest of all parties who are looking to invest in UK nuclear projects.” The Kepco chief executive and chair, Kim Dong-cheol, visited the Wylfa site last November as part of a South Korean delegation looking at UK nuclear opportunities. Virginia Crosbie, the MP for Ynys Môn, said the delegation had told her it “was a better nuclear site than any they had” because of its grid connection and abundance of cooling water around the site. Kepco also struck a memorandum of understanding with the global engineering, management and development consultancy Mott MacDonald last year to explore UK nuclear opportunities and support the company with licensing and site development. The American nuclear developer Westinghouse and the construction group Bechtel have proposed building a new plant at Wylfa using Westinghouse’s AP1000 reactor technology. Kepco would be aiming to use its APR1400 reactor technology, which has recently been deployed at the Barakah nuclear energy plant in the United Arab Emirates. The other option being weighed up for the Wylfa site is whether to use it to host a number of new small modular reactors (SMRs), which are designed to be cheaper and quicker to build than large plants, but the technology is still unproven. The decision on the technology provider, and what type of technology should be used at Wylfa, will be made by Great British Nuclear, which was launched with the aim of providing new power stations, including a fleet of SMRs. Despite the UK’s nuclear ambitions, only one plant is under construction – Hinkley Point C in Somerset. Its sister project, Sizewell C in Suffolk, received a nuclear site licence last week.",

        "title": "Your office software is not the problem – you are",
        "content": "Hating on office software is one of modern life’s favorite pastimes. Expenses, time off, hiring – every week another bit of office life seems to get a new app and a new set of haters. This past week it was Workday’s turn. The HR and productivity platform that many large – and not-so-large – companies use to help facilitate everything from onboarding new employees to benefits management and performance reviews “has been making a mint creating misery where painless processes could be”, according to Business Insider titled: “Everyone hates Workday.” But as the piece points out – it’s not all Workday’s fault. And as the owner of a company that sells customer relationship management (CRM) software to small and mid-sized businesses, I can tell you something that most software vendors are thinking, but don’t want to say publicly: if you don’t like the software, don’t blame the software. Blame yourself. When a flight is delayed because of an unruly, drunk passenger is that the airline’s fault? When your car breaks down because you haven’t had it serviced in years is it because your car is bad? Was it the stadium’s responsibility that you are doubled up by indigestion after eating a hotdog to celebrate every inning during “dollar dog night”? Who doesn’t love to point fingers elsewhere – especially at a faceless “app” – when we don’t want to take responsibility for our own failings? Workday isn’t perfect. It’s a big, complicated system and like any big, complicated system it requires big, complicated grownups to run it. The problem is that most organizations don’t have big, complicated grownups running them. The managers assigned to implement products like Workday (and the CRM systems we sell) tend to be lower-level drones who step aside from challenges and avoid the extra effort required to really make products like this work the way they’re supposed to. They’re afraid of taking risks, confronting others, being assertive and having thoughts. They don’t want to lose their jobs over a “silly” HR or CRM application. They’ll do anything to cover their asses. So what do these systems require? The same that’s required of all business investments: time and money. Time needs to be spent properly planning out the implementation of these systems in the short term and then more time needs to be devoted over the long term to improve how the system is used. Software applications like Workday aren’t a one-and-done investment, they’re a long-term relationship. Money needs to be spent on the right licenses and modules but also on hiring the right outside consultants to properly implement, integrate, migrate data and – and this cannot be stressed enough – train. This is a long-term investment that has to be considered upfront and with commitment. Some managers and owners get this. They understand that they’ve invested serious dollars in systems like Workday not just to improve productivity but – just as importantly – to create a data store that increases the value of their company both to their existing management teams and potential future investors. They continue to invest in their administrators and their software and, although sympathetic to their workers’ complaints, have the bigger picture in mind. They say: we’ll provide you with support to use the system, so use the system because it’s not always about you, it’s also about the organization. People who don’t get it turn their staff into the people interviewed in the Business Insider column who say things like “I simply hate Workday” or “Everything is non-intuitive, so even the simplest tasks leave me scratching my head.” But next time you are bashing the company software, look in the mirror, folks. Like many of our so-called problems, it’s not the software. It’s us.",

        "title": "Capital Group buys more than £110m in NatWest shares after UK government share cut",
        "content": "A leading US investor has started pouring cash into NatWest shares after a notable cut in the government’s shareholding helped to allay fears of state intervention in the bailed-out banking group. Los Angeles-headquartered Capital Group, which is one of the world’s oldest and largest investment firms, with more than £2.5tn under management, has bought more than £110m worth of NatWest shares, days after the government cut its position, pushing the group into the bank’s top 30 shareholder list. Capital had been considering buying a stake for months, after strong profits and a meeting with the newly appointed chief executive, Paul Thwaite, in February, it is understood. NatWest last year made its biggest annual profit since the start of the financial crisis in 2007, helped by high interest rates. However, a City source said investors like Capital had been put off by the government’s 30% stake, which meant it was still classed as a controlling shareholder. The government holding is a hangover from its £46bn bailout of NatWest, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland Group, which resulted in the state taking an 83% stake in the lender in the 2008 financial crisis. The government’s stake fell below 30% for the first time in late March, opening the door to a fresh wave of investment from the US firm. Benjamin Toms, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: “Politics and banking have been fairly entwined from a European and UK perspective over the years, and that has always a bit of worry in the back of investors’ minds. If the government owns a sizeable stake, they can have a bit more leverage … around whether banks are adequately passing on higher rates to deposit holders, or lending to SMEs. “There’s a worry that if the government has a stake in your firm, they could wield power, even if in realistic terms it shouldn’t make huge difference as a minority holder.” Capital Group vehicles bought up 33m shares at the end of March, days after the government’s stake dropped, amounting to a nearly 0.4% stake, according to the last available public data. It is understood that Capital has since continued its buying spree. Behind the UK government, the bank’s largest shareholders include MFS Investment Management, with a 5.1% stake, Norges Bank Investment Management, with a 3.7% stake, and the Vanguard Group, with a 2.3% stake. Aside from financial crisis-era interventions on executive pay and conversations around the departure of the former chief executive Stephen Hester in 2013, ministers have taken a largely hands-off approach to the management of NatWest. However, concerns over government influence were raised last summer after ministers pushed for the resignation of Alison Rose as chief executive after a row with the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage over the closure of his accounts at the private bank Coutts. In 2018 the Labour party signalled plans to halt further stake sales and use RBS to boost funding to small businesses. Labour’s current leadership under Keir Starmer has not voiced any similar plans. Speaking at the AGM last month, NatWest’s new chair, Rick Haythornthwaite, said: “I think there’s undoubtedly a perception of more intervention from His Majesty’s Treasury than there really is. Removing that overhang is a value … and I think that can only be good as we think about the future.” Capital Group’s investment will be welcomed by the Conservative-led UK government, which is rushing to return NatWest to private ownership by 2025-26, and is teeing up a campaign that could lead to a chunk of its stake being sold directly to retail customers as early as this summer. A Capital Group spokesperson said the firm would not comment on individual companies or holdings. NatWest declined to comment.",

        "title": "Impact of pandemic on wellbeing of the young and the economy must not be trivialised |  Larry Elliott",
        "content": "From the outset it was obvious the coronavirus pandemic would be brutal on the UK’s young people. Just how brutal has only become apparent over time. Children, teenagers and adults in their early 20s were the least likely to have adverse physical consequences but suffered most from the restrictions put in place to prevent the virus spreading. Children were deprived of education. Teenagers were stuck in their homes and unable to see their friends in person. The concentration of young adults working in hospitality meant they were most vulnerable to being furloughed or losing their jobs. It was a recipe for an increase in unhappiness and mental illness – and so it has proved. People in their early 20s are more likely to be out of work because of ill health than those in their early 40s. All this would be bad enough had young people gone into the pandemic in good shape. But as a new academic paper shows, the mental health of young people has been deteriorating for a decade and a half. This is not just a UK phenomenon. The same has been found to be happening in more than 30 other countries. It used to be assumed that there was a U-shaped trend to wellbeing, with happiness declining as young people entered middle age and then rising again as they got older. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, and his two co-authors of the paper, Alex Bryson and Xiaowei Xu, show that this is no longer the case. Their evidence suggests the younger you are, the unhappier you are. In the UK and the US the trend is particularly pronounced among young white women. The study looks at whether people feel anxious or are in despair, with the latter measured by asking survey respondents how many days out of the last 30 their mental health has not been good. If someone says every day is a bad mental health day, they are classified as suffering from despair. Approximately 8% of all UK respondents were classed as being in despair in 2009-10, rising to 12% in 2020-21. Among men under 25, despair has doubled from 5% to 11% since 2009. The percentage of young women in despair rose even more sharply, from 8% in 2011 to 20% by 2020. It also doubled (from 9% to 18%) among women aged 25-44. The increase among older women was much less pronounced. The deterioration in the mental wellbeing of the young can be traced back to the scarring effects of the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008-09. This was a time when the banks almost went bust, the supply of credit dried up, economies contracted and unemployment rose sharply. The paper argues that the employment prospects of new entrants to the labour market at the time of the GFC may have suffered irreparable damage. The period since has been one of wage stagnation. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, the average UK worker is about 40% – or almost £14,000 a year – worse off than if earnings had continued to grow in line with their pre-financial crisis trend. Incomes of young people have been especially hard hit, so much so that the current generation is likely to be the first for a century to be poorer than their parents, and have levels of home ownership comparable with their grandparents. There are clearly economic reasons behind rising unhappiness among young people, although these do not explain why reported levels of wellbeing have fallen among 10- to 16-year-olds who are yet to enter the world of work. More recently, three other factors may have played a part, the authors of the paper say. The first is the underfunding of mental health treatment in the US and the UK, where delays in access to care may have prolonged spells of ill health. The second is the increasing use of smartphones, which became more widely available at about the same time as the upward trend in cases of despair began to appear. “There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rise in ill-being of the young is associated with the rise in the use of the internet and smartphones. The timing fits almost exactly, both the use of the internet and the declining mental health of the young, and especially for young females, both started climbing from around 2011,” the paper says. Finally, there is the impact of Covid, which, although it cannot explain the deterioration in mental health among the young during the GFC and its aftermath, may well have accelerated the trend. Putting young people in effect under house arrest was always asking for trouble. Government ministers are worried about the negative impact inactivity is having on the economy, and will have further cause for concern when the latest labour market figures are released on Tuesday. These will show that the number of people out of the labour force because of ill health is up by a third on pre-pandemic levels. Rishi Sunak recently announced a crackdown on sickness and disability benefits in order to end a “sicknote culture” and “over-medicalising the everyday challenges and worries of life”. The prime minister is in danger of trivialising the deep-rooted nature of a problem that will only be solved by tackling the causes of unhappiness and increasing the budget for mental health services. It may mean age restrictions on access to social media for children. It certainly means that when there is another pandemic, the full long-term costs on all age groups of lockdown restrictions are taken into account. That wasn’t the case in 2020, with disastrous results.",

        "title": "As the Red Sea crisis continues, pressure on consumer prices follows in its wake",
        "content": "When footage first appeared of Houthi rebels hijacking the cargo ship Galaxy Leader in the Red Sea last November, it sent shockwaves through the world of trade. The coordinated attack on the ship, which was partly owned by Israeli billionaire Abraham Ungar, was the start of a six-month campaign by Yemen-based militants to terrorise western vessels using the route, in response to the conflict in Gaza. The campaign has since escalated: vessels on the key shipping route are being targeted by missiles and drones, with the Houthis claiming 107 attacks. Three seafarers have been killed. The result has been a complete realignment of global trade. The Suez Canal, through which 12% of global trade used to pass, saw traffic drop by 66% at the start of April, when compared with a year earlier. Many shipping firms are now diverting vessels on to the safer, but much longer and more costly, route around the tip of southern Africa, passing the Cape of Good Hope. This can add 10 days to a journey and increase fuel costs by 40%. The few ships that use the Red Sea route are still under threat, however. This was underlined last week when shipping line Maersk said attacks had intensified, and the risk zone was now bigger. Maersk said it would continue to send its ships around Africa for the foreseeable future, but that that would result in a 20% drop in capacity in the second quarter of the year, and additional costs. Last week, it trebled the surcharge on containers travelling between Asia and Northern Europe from $250 to $750. For huge companies like Maersk to small businesses in the UK and elsewhere reliant on goods from Asia and the Middle East, the crisis continues to have an impact. A British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) survey in February of its exporter members found that more than half (53%) of manufacturers and retailers had been affected by the Red Sea crisis. Some reported price rises of 300% for container hire, and four weeks being added to delivery times. Manufactured goods from Asia, including cars, furniture and textiles, appear to be the worst hit, but oil from the Middle East is also affected. About 70% of all of Europe’s car parts are shipped through the Red Sea from Asia. The disruption has meant carmakers including Volvo and Tesla suspending some production lines because of a lack of parts. Vauxhall owner Stellantis said it was turning to air freight for some parts, to bypass the Red Sea. The oil market has not seen the huge spike in prices that was initially expected, but the crisis, along with the wider Middle East situation, has contributed to prices increasing from just under $76 a barrel at the start of the year to almost $84. Despite this, there has as yet been no significant rise in consumer costs. John Stawpert, environment and trade manager at the International Chamber of Shipping, says the crisis has shown how resilient the shipping industry is. “The impact that some people predicted, particularly with respect to inflation, we just haven’t seen. A few months ago, we were talking 0.1 and 0.2%, which is just a rounding error.” The Office for National Statistics’ UK trade report, out on Friday, said there had been no evidence the crisis had affected UK import levels between January and March. Some of this will be because companies are realigning their supply chains. Asos and Boohoo have ramped up their “nearshoring” – sourcing more products from Turkey and Morocco rather than Asia. Marco Forgione, director general of the Institute of Export and International Trade, also points out that some companies have switched to rail freight, with the number of trains leaving China for Europe dramatically increasing in recent months. For William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, the long-term impact of the disruption will depend on how long it goes on. “Companies will have to make decisions on sourcing and supply chains, and if this does become a new normal, they will need to decide whether this is something they can adjust to, or whether it is too difficult,” he says. With the Houthi leadership reaffirming last week that they would not stop their campaign until the conflict in Gaza had ended, businesses will not be counting on the disruption ending any time soon.",

        "title": "The wisest Brexiters – such as Nigel Lawson – knew how good life is in Europe | William Keegan",
        "content": "With all the horrors in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan – not to say (a touch of bathos here) the abysmal state of our Brexit-hit economy – a bank holiday weekend in La France profonde came as a most welcome relief. We were staying with a friend in the south-west region of Aveyron, near a village called La Salvetat-Peyralès. I was struck by the thriving nature of the local rural economy – no potholes in sight – and the general atmosphere of wellbeing. As usual, as on all my trips to the continent, I met people who expressed astonishment at the harm the UK had done to itself with the Brexit referendum. Suddenly, a fascinating memory resurfaced. We were not too far from the village, Vic-Fezensac, where the former chancellor and my old friend Nigel Lawson lived for some years in contented retirement. In 2007, I visited him there for a series of articles on former chancellors. (They were reprinted in my book, Nine Crises.) Lawson was a free-market Thatcherite who championed deregulation and reducing the size of the state. I asked him what had attracted him to the area. Without hesitation, Mrs Thatcher’s former chancellor replied: “The old-fashioned way of life – and the health service”. I am not making this up! Now, it is interesting that our beleaguered prime minister, Rishi Sunak, regards Lawson as a political role model. Indeed, he is reported to have a picture of Lawson in his office. Given his hero worship, Sunak might well be advised to delve into Lawson’s memoirs, where he makes short shrift of the idea – apparently favoured by Sunak –that national insurance should be abolished and merged with income tax. As Lawson wrote: “This would have been undesirable on a number of grounds. It would have had the unfortunate appearance of an increase in income tax. It would have weakened in the public mind the truth that social security benefits have to be paid for.” Chancellor Lawson was a firm believer in the contributory principle. Unfortunately, Lawson became an influential propagator of Brexit. The irony of his choice to retire to France was not lost on the British public. He was among those who argued that the benefits of our trading advantages with our closest neighbours could be replaced easily by trade deals under the umbrella of the World Trade Organization (WTO). For such a clever man, this was a fatal conceit, as has been illustrated by disastrous attempts by this Brexit-blinded government to effect such deals. (I should add here that, although a Brexiter, he once told me he was unhappy with some of the company he was keeping!) So, here we are, with Brexit now recognised as an unmitigated disaster, whose failure has made an unmistakable contribution to placing the UK in the fourth division for economic prospects, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. This is notwithstanding a brave attempt by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to put an optimistic gloss on a minor recovery in UK output – from a low base – during the first quarter. The massacre of the Conservatives in the local elections shows that most of the nation has lost confidence in the Tories. This is the final reckoning: the public’s verdict on the accumulation of excessively rightwing policies of austerity – and, yes, on Brexit, whose failure has evidently dawned on the “red wall” constituencies. Many of these were simply conned by a bunch of liars, although few people like to admit they have been conned. One of the politicians who saw through the Brexit nonsense from the start was Keir Starmer. Unfortunately, instead of having the courage of his convictions and persuading former Labour voters who had been seduced by Brexit of his case, the Labour leader did a U-turn: no return to the single market, or even the customs union. But surely now it’s time for him to go back to first principles. The economy is £140bn worse off as a consequence of Brexit. Our trade is about 15% lower than if we had never left. Labour is struggling to explain how it can finance some unambitious public spending plans, yet Brexit has knocked some £40-50bn off the exchequer’s potential tax revenue. To say they are making an election issue of the Tories’ handling of the economy, but to eschew attacking them for Brexit, is bizarre. Brexit is a central plank of their economic failure. Moreover, as recent reports about the impact of the delayed barriers on normal trade demonstrate, the worst has yet to come. As France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, made clear in a recent interview with the Economist, Europe needs to hang together in the face of some obvious geopolitical horrors. Restoration of our trading relations with the EU would be a start. Starmer is a football fan and player. Brexit is an open goal.",

        "title": "Sake takes UK by storm as Japan’s national drink goes mainstream",
        "content": "When sommelier Erika Haigh opened the UK’s first independent sake bar, in London’s West End in 2019, passersby would wander in and try to order milkshakes, bewildered by the unfamiliar drink advertised in the window. “Today, that confusion has largely disappeared,” said Haigh, who has since opened Mai Sake, a shop offering tasting events and meals. “You can now go on a sake bar crawl across London, and you’ll find it featured on the beverage lists of many restaurants – including non-Japanese establishments.” The Japanese fermented rice drink, typically about 15% ABV, is becoming increasingly important on the international drinks market. Exports have grown virtually every year for the past 13 years and the export market in 2023 was 1.8 times larger than in 2019, with sales totalling ¥41.1bn (£211m). China and the US are the biggest consumers of sake, but the UK market is growing. Sake is no longer drunk just for courage at karaoke clubs, but sold in specialist shops and sophisticated bars. Waitrose reported searches for sake on its website have increased 241% year on year, while searches for plum sake were also up 100% on 2023. Even Wagamama – one of the first restaurants to offer the drink nationwide – has just added a sparkling sake to its list. Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, the UK’s oldest wine merchant, has started selling sake “en primeur”, a method favoured by collectors – a chance to buy wine before it is bottled and typically for a good price. The practice was started in Bordeaux and is associated with French and Italian vintages, so to see sake offered for sale this way indicates a big change in perception in the UK. “We’ve seen increasing interest in our sake offering, and wanted to add something exciting for our customers,” said Rob Whitehead, spirits buyer at Berry Bros &amp; Rudd. “This is a unique product that speaks to experienced wine collectors – those who understand that patience is key when collecting – and to newcomers.” The company has sold twice as much sake by value in the past year than in the previous three financial years. Whitehead said that, while their loyal customers are becoming more adventurous and investing in sake, they are also seeing entirely new buyers. Haigh grew up in Japan – she is Canadian and Japanese – but only really started to appreciate her home country once she’d left. She trained as a sommelier and started to make connections with traditional breweries in Japan. Haigh said the rise of sake is in large part due to the hard work of insiders in the industry over the past decade, but that there has also been a surge of interest in Japanese culture and cuisine in the UK. This shows at every price point: Tesco sold 21m packs of sushi in its meal deal in 2023, while upmarket omakase restaurants have also gained popularity, especially in London. Omakase means “I’ll leave it to you” and these restaurants specialise in unique set menus devised by the chef. Overall the UK Japanese cuisine market has risen from £797m in 2017 to £1.2bn in 2023. With concurrent trends for artisan food production and natural ingredients, sake ticks a lot of boxes. “Premium sake contains no preservatives, tannins or sulphites, which appeals to this newfound consumer consciousness,” said Haigh. “Additionally, the industry supports small craft producers and preserves a tradition of sake-making that spans over 2,000 years.” Japan’s application for traditional sake brewing to be added to Unesco’s list of intangible cultural heritage is being considered this year. The UK also seems to be showing growing interest in other Asian spirits and drinks. Shochu is a spirit that is now regularly featured as a cocktail ingredient at British bars, made from grains such as rice and barley as well as sweet potato and molasses. Baijiu, a potent traditional Chinese drink made from fermented sorghum is actually the world’s bestselling spirit and has finally been discovered by British drinkers. Whitehead says the growing popularity of sake is part because it’s “one of the most food-friendly drinks out there”. At the events Haigh organises, they have paired sake with everything from pizza to Michelin-starred mains. She recommends that the sake-curious dabble with the drink by trying it with a meal. “Pair sake with familiar foods so the experience is less daunting. Swap the white wine at your alfresco lunch for a fresh and fruity sake served chilled in a white-wine glass, or replace a pint of Guinness at your steak dinner with a savoury and robust sake served closer to room temperature.”",

        "title": "US and China need ‘climate armistice’ to meet net zero, says former head of CSIRO",
        "content": "The world needs a “climate armistice” between the US and China if net zero emissions are to be reached while Australia should hone its efforts on a few key areas where it has an unusual competitive edge, Larry Marshall, the former CSIRO chief executive, said. Speaking ahead of Tuesday’s budget in which the Albanese government’s Future Made In Australia (FMIA) plans will probably be prominent, Marshall said the nation ought to focus any industrial support on sectors such as processing of lithium or vanadium or products that realistically scale up. Australia’s “great unfair advantage is controlling the raw materials” used in batteries, solar panels and other decarbonising products, he said. Similarly, China was unlikely to surrender its steelmaking dominance but might be open to buying iron ore made into pellets in Australia using renewable energy sources that greatly cut emissions. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “In that way, we kind of earn our way into the global supply chain but without trying to own it all,” said Marshall, who will also be among the speakers at the Climate Action Week, starting on Monday in Sydney. While some of the impetus for the FMIA – and the US’s much larger Inflation Reduction Act – was to diversify from over-reliance on China, Marshall said he’d “hate to see the world splinter”. “Climate change is a global problem. It needs that global level of collaboration,” he said, adding that a “climate armistice [between the US and China is] maybe the thing that keeps us together”. The federal government has so far earmarked more than $20bn in its National Reconstruction Fund, Hydrogen Headstart, Solar Sunshot and other programs in its strategy to accelerate manufacturing in Australia. The 2024-25 budget is likely to tip in more money. Economist Saul Eslake, though, said there was a bipartisan belief “there’s something inherently more noble about manufacturing than other types of economic activity, and that manufacturing jobs are more important than other jobs”. Productivity of manufacturers in Australia was about 11% below the industry average unlike the comparison in a handful of advanced nations such as US, Japan, and Germany, he said. Australia also lacked the large domestic market of such nations, and its distance from markets added transport costs for what were often bulky goods. Eslake said security threats were “exaggerated by the security establishment”. If Americans were “willing to waste squillions of their tax dollars” subsidising a product such as solar panels, “why don’t we buy it off them?” “This is just manufacturing fetishism,” he said. “Like almost all types of fetishism, it’s unwise and risky.” Marshall said Australia was among the top 10 nations for science and should seek to capitalise on its smarts. Governments were also likely to be more patient than market-only funds, underscoring the value of their intervention. “If you’re too rigid with the [key performance indicators], you might shut things down before they get a chance to go,” Marshall said. “With science, you can’t schedule invention.” Marshall said investments in areas such as small modular nuclear reactors – as proposed by the federal opposition – should be approached with caution. “Nuclear fusion is exciting, and Australian funds like HostPlus are invested in it, but it’s not here yet,” he said. “CSIRO’s Gencost [survey] shows that existing renewables can decarbonise our electricity system, eliminating 30% of our problem,” he said. The survey compared established technologies at scale, something SMRs had not yet achieved.",

        "title": "‘A world first’: project recycles polyester into yarn for new clothes",
        "content": "Football shirts, sports event banners and uniforms are piled up ready to be pumped into a machine which melts them down for recycling ready to be made into new clothes. In a world first in Kettering, Northamptonshire, Project Re:claim is taking technology used for recycling plastic bottles and adapting it to reprocess polyester textiles into granules that can be turned back into yarn for new clothes. The joint venture between the Salvation Army and recycling specialist Project Plan B uses items from the charity’s sorting centre, which separates out the 10-20% of donated items that cannot be resold according to type of textile. Infrared sensors pick out wool, cotton and nylon items that can be sent off to experimental reprocessors and yarn makers around the world – including polyester for the pellet-making machine. Project Re:claim expects to recycle 2,500 tonnes of waste this year and to double that in 2025. It is working with big retailers, including Tesco and John Lewis, as well as specialist manufacturers such as school uniform maker David Luke, which encourage suppliers to use the recycled polyester. The venture, partly funded by a government-backed grant, is part of a movement aimed at tackling the enormous pile of unwanted and unwearable clothing that is sent to landfill or for incineration every year, and the high carbon emissions of the fashion industry. In the UK, about half of the 1.45m tonnes of used textiles generated annually ends up in the household bin and is mostly incinerated, according to a report by the government recycling body, Wrap. A further 650,000 tonnes is sent for reuse or recycling but most of that goes into making products such as fillings for mattresses or car doors, which are also likely to end up in landfill. Just 20% of used textiles is sold for clothing. More than 420,000 tonnes of unwanted items are sent overseas, where they can end their days in unregulated landfill or strewn across the beaches of Ghana and the dunes of the Atacama desert in Chile. The industry has been slow to tackle the problem, with some projects brewing for more than a decade and one major facility recently going bust. However, industry watchers say now the used-textiles-to-yarn industry is set for rapid expansion as legislation and consumer pressure combine to force major retailers to act. “I’m expecting rapid change from this point,”ays Prof Parik Goswami, director of the technical textiles research centre at the University of Huddersfield. “Over the next 10 years we will see an absolute revolution.” Countries in Africa and Asia that once accepted used clothing from the west are pushing back, while retailers’ environmental targets, created under pressure from customers, have begun to loom large. Change has been accelerated by EU legislation, due next year, under which states must organise separate textile collection, and a proposal for brands to pay for handling waste. France and the Netherlands are already bringing in stringent measures on the handling of used textiles. In the UK, MPs last month began re-examining plans requiring retailers and brands to pay towards the recycling of used clothing and household textiles. That would be a step on from voluntary agreements already in place, which include the Textiles 2030 deal to reduce carbon emissions and the ACT UK project to develop locally based material recycling. Marks &amp; Spencer kicked off a new initiative with Oxfam under which it is asking for donations of unwearable items for reprocessing. It plans for at least some of those items to be recyled into new textiles and others to be upcycled, but full details have not been confirmed. Earlier this month, H&amp;M told MPs it was aiming for half of its materials to be recycled by 2030 – up from just over a fifth at present. It wants all of its polyester to be recycled, up from just under 80% last year. That polyester all comes from plastic bottles at present, but the company has formed a joint venture, Syre, which it says will set up a blueprint polyester textile recycling centre in the US this year and 11 more by 2032. Making old clothes into yarn is not new: shoddy was the name of the wool cloth made from yarn spun from shredded textiles in the 1800s. In 2011, M&amp;S worked with Oxfam and a mill in Italy to collect and reprocess cashmere knitwear to be remade into coats, but the trial quietly ended after it could not find enough unwanted knitwear to reprocess. Today, many hi-tech options are springing up around the world. Forestry group Södra in Sweden turns a mix of used cotton and wood pulp into fibre; Recover in Spain recycles used cotton fibres into yarn and has recently expanded with a new facility in Bangladesh while German chemical maker BASF has teamed up with Zara owner Inditex to trial recycling nylon. Finland’s Infinited Fiber, which has trial plants turning cotton into a cellulose-based fibre, recently raised $43m (£34m) to help build a commercial scale plant. Coming full circle, in Yorkshire, the wool recycling firm iinouiio (It Is Never Over Until It Is Over) began by using traditional equipment once used to make shoddy to recycle luxury woollen yarns in 2019. In 2022, it partnered with Camira, a global fabric manufacturer, to provide wool recycling to retailers and is taking textiles from the Salvation Army. However, progress may not be easy. The future of Renewcell in Sweden – the world’s first commercial-scale recycling plant that turns textiles into to pulp ready for thread – hangs in the balance. The company called in administrators in February after being undercut by a fall in the price of virgin viscose. Administrators are considering two or three bids for the company and are hopeful of securing a deal as a going concern. Renewcell’s troubles highlight the difficulties such experimental technologies face in securing enough finance to overcome glitches in a very complex supply chain and competition from often cheaper virgin materials. Textile-to-textile recycling needs a reliable supply of used textiles processed to reduce contamination, a yarnmaker ready to buy the recycled material and fabric, and clothing brands prepared to use a product which may not meet the criteria of materials they usually work with. Back in Kettering, they are battling with all those challenges. Majonne Frost, head of environment and sustainability at the Salvation Army Trading Company, says it has been trialling different kinds of feedstock – from sports kit to hospital curtains – for the Re:claim recycling machines. It has also spent time persuading brands and manufacturers to change buttons and trims so a uniform, for example, is made entirely from polyester and can be put into the machine without the need for complex processing. Challenges vary from dealing with contamination such as human hair – which can tint the granules, making them less easy to dye to any colour – to the additional costs involved in shipping the granules back to yarn spinners, which are usually based in Asia or, at the nearest, Turkey. “We are developing the market. This is a world-first technology and people are not used to using this product, so it is about making companies aware and collaborating to get recycled polyester built into their supply chains,” she says. “Lots of conversations are happening.” Goswami says that the technology is there to process used clothing and what is needed is cooperation and investment to make things happen. “People are serious about it,” he says. “If we are going to [achieve] net zero, we don’t have much option.”",

        "title": "World Bank and IMF can press Ghana to rethink ‘punitive’ LGBTQ law, charities say",
        "content": "The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are coming under pressure to use their financial might to persuade Ghana to reconsider a proposed law that could lead to anyone who identifies as LGBTQ+ being jailed for three years. Charities and campaign groups are calling on the global development bodies to tell Ghana they may stop funding the country if the proposed legislation – which will be challenged in the country’s supreme court next week – comes into effect. The “promotion of proper human sexual rights and Ghanaian family values” bill recommends jailing anyone convicted of identifying as gay for up to three years, imprisoning “promoters” of gay rights for up to five years, and increasing the term for having gay sex from three to five years. Elana Berger, executive director of the Bank Information Center, a charity that campaigns for better transparency, accountability and inclusion in development finance, said the World Bank was in a unique position to “persuade Ghana to reconsider” with the prospect of losing its promised $3.8bn (£3bn) of funding. “We believe that everything the World Bank does should be moral, fair and inclusive,” she said. “Funding a country with this law will lead to discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. We’re not anti the World Bank, but it can do a lot more to improve the inclusion of its projects.” She said the Ghanian parliament’s vote to pass the bill in February despite the threat of losing World Bank funding suggested “the desire to harm LGBTQ+ people trumps the desire to develop the economy”. Ghana’s finance ministry has warned that if the law comes into effect it could lead to the country losing $3.8bn in World Bank financing over the next five to six years. Losing that funding, the ministry said, could “derail” a $3bn bailout programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and its efforts to restructure its $20bn debt pile. “This will in turn trigger a market reaction which will affect the stability of the exchange rate,” the ministry said in a leaked memo. The World Bank last year halted some funding to Uganda due to the country’s newly passed anti-LGBTQ legislation, which includes the death penalty or life imprisonment for some same-sex acts, saying “fundamentally contradicts the World Bank group’s values”. “We believe our vision to eradicate poverty on a livable planet can only succeed if it includes everyone irrespective of race, gender, or sexuality,” the bank said. “This law undermines those efforts.” Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAids, said evidence showed that punitive laws such as Ghana’s were “a barrier to ending Aids, and ultimately undermine everyone’s health”. She added: “Approaches rooted in inclusion of all people have been crucial to Ghana’s progress in the HIV response … if this bill becomes law, it will obstruct access to life-saving services, undercut social protection, and jeopardise Ghana’s development success.” Genevieve Partington, Amnesty International’s Ghana country director, said: “The bill is one of the most draconian in Africa and seeks to further criminalise lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. “It also seeks to punish anyone who supports or advocates for LGBT people, including human rights defenders, medical professionals, journalists, teachers, and landlords in violation of the right to freedom of expression and association, with a prison term.” A spokesperson for the World Bank said: “The bill has not yet been signed into law, and we generally do not comment on draft legislation. We have a longstanding and productive relationship with Ghana.” An IMF spokesperson said: “We have learned from extensive experience that more inclusive development is more successful development. In this case, we recognise that this bill is being challenged in the courts; it is important to let that process play out.” During a visit to Ghana earlier this year, Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said: “At this point, what we know is that citizens in Ghana have challenged the constitutionality [of the law]. I will not comment on the details of the bill. Let’s see what the court have to say.” The supreme court adjourned its hearing on the proposed law to 17 May.",

        "title": "FTSE 100 hits new closing high after UK economy escapes recession with fastest growth since 2021 – as it happened",
        "content": "A late update: The FTSE 100 share index has finished the day at a new alltime high of 8433 points. That’s a gain of 52 points, or 0.6%, and means the blue-chip share index has racked up its third weekly gain in a row. It’s been on quite the rally since mid-April. Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “It’s Friday afternoon, the sun’s out, and the FTSE 100 has closed at an all-time high – no this is not a dream. Investors are finally starting to look at UK businesses and see reasons to be optimistic. The Bank of England held rates steady earlier in the week but hinted at rate cuts to come. Meanwhile, economic growth came in better than expected, but crucially not too much better to drive up fears it could cause inflation to spike. This comes on the cusp of major UK banks reporting over the past couple of weeks, and there was a huge array of optimism from management teams around the outlook for the UK. Many will look at this run and assume it has no legs, UK investors have been beaten down too many times in the past. UK bulls will argue it’s been long overdue, with the market suffering from a hefty valuation discount to global peers for some time. Next week’s jobs and wages data will be key for momentum, markets will want to see continued signs that stickier elements of inflation are easing, or it’ll raise fresh questions about if and when rate cuts might come.” Time to recap…. The UK is officially out of recession after figures showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the first three months of the year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the period from January to the end of March marked a return to growth after a mild recession in the second half of 2023. It was the strongest rate of quarterly growth since the end of 2021, and a better performance than expected by economists, who forecast growth of 0.4% in the first quarter. The downturn came to an end after an increase in activity across the services sector, which has flourished since the turn of the year as wages have outstripped inflation, easing the pressure on consumers. However, forecasters expect the UK to grow slowly this year as high interest rates and last year’s inflation surge continue to take their toll on disposable incomes. The Bank of England has predicted that a lack of momentum in the economy means gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by only 0.5% this year. The Bank kept interest rates unchanged at 5.25% on Thursday but indicated it may begin cutting them from June. Economists broadly hailed the pick-up in growth, which suggests the UK economy may do better this year than expected. Here’s the full story: And our analysis: Optimism over economic prospects, and hopes that interest rates will soon be cut, helped to push the UK’s FTSE 100 to a new intraday high of 8455 points today – on track for another strong week. And in other news: Deutsche Bank has lifted its forecast for UK growth this year, saying: We now expect UK GDP to expand by 0.8% (previously: 0.5%), converging with the OBR’s central projection, but sitting some way above consensus (0.3%) and the Bank of England’s now slightly stale growth forecast (0.5%). We maintain our GDP growth projections for 2025 and 2026 at 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively (Figure 10). Over in the City of London today, Standard Chartered has been accused of being complicit in environmental destruction by environmental activists, at its annual general meeting. A group called the Climate Choir Movement sang a tune called “Fossil Fuels are Trouble”, a reworking of Taylor Swift’s hit “I Knew You Were Trouble” They say Standard Chartered is complicit in environment destruction and human rights violations in the Philippines and Mozambique. Here’s a clip from the AGM: Jo Flanagan, co-founder of the Climate Choir Movement, says: “Last year we sang at Barclays AGM. In March we occupied and sang in the Houses of Parliament. And today we say to Standard Chartered ‘your standards are twisted’. While they continue to invest in dirty gas and coal, global warming has exceeded temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius over a 12-month period. This is a dire warning to humanity — a warning that some bankers still do not seem to heed.” Luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has reported its highest ever yearly sales and its biggest profit in nearly a decade. In a sign that JLR’s customers are not cutting back, the auro maker has reported £29bn revenues in the year to March, over a quarter higher than the previous year. This was driven by record sales of its Range Rover vehicles. Around 133,000 vehicles had been ordered at the end of the financial year, three quarters of which were for Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Defender models. The group’s pre-tax profit hit £2.2bn, the highest amount since 2015, it said. Customers clearly weren’t put off by a wave of thefts of Range Rovers, which has pushed up the cost of insuring the cars. Inded, JLR reports that there is strong interest in its Range Rover Electric, with over 28,700 sign ups to the waiting list since opening in December 2023. With less than 90 minutes trading to do, the UK’s FTSE 100 share index is on track to post its second-best week of the year. It’s gained around 2.8% this week, rising to a new alltime high of 8,455 points today, its best weekly gain since a fortnight ago. George Lagarias, chief economist at Mazars, sees plenty of positive signs from UK large caps (companies with a high market capitalisation), saying: For one, the rally was broad-based, with only a handful of stocks underperforming. Even more important, the outperformers centred largely around the consumer discretionary sector. Following this morning’s positive Q1 GDP print, on the back of a strong services sector, the stock market seems even more confident that British consumers will manage to bring the UK economy back towards trend growth.” Today’s UK GDP report shows that the economy is “finally catchig up a bit”, says Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. Schmieding explains: After years of self-inflicted Brexit turmoil, the UK economy can – from a somewhat depressed level – expand at a pace at least in line with that of its biggest trading partner, the Eurozone. The solid gain in GDP reduces the need for an immediate rate cut. Schmieding adds that the UK economy has underperformed the US and the Eurozone since the start of the pandemic, telling clients: The slump in 2020 was deeper and the subsequent recovery levelled off in 2022 even more so than in the Eurozone in the wake of the surge in energy and food prices. The strong Q1 GDP data partly correct an unexpectedly weak finish to 2023 Richard Walker, the executive chairman of Iceland Foods, says it is “immeasurably wrong” of the government to tell people to be grateful the recession is over. Speaking to Radio 4’s The World At One, Walker explains that consumers are still suffering from the cost of living squeeze, even though the economy is growing. Walker – who quit the Conservatives last October – says: My customers are still paying the price of the Truss calamity. Inflation is still baked in and day-to-day living expenses are still very much affected. We’ve had years of price rises now, and people do feel worse off, because they are. Walker adds that Iceland recently conducted a survey of 4,000 customers – it found that 94% said conditions are not getting any better. Many cited sub-par public services and unaffortable childcare. He adds: I think it’s immeasurably wrong of the government to tell people to feel grateful that we’ve exited recession. Rishi Sunak has insisted that “things are starting to feel better” and that confidence in the economy is growing after the UK economy moved out of recession, PA Media report. On a visit to Siemens Healthineers factory in Eynsham, Oxfordshire, Sunak claimed that the Government’s economic plan was working. Sunak told Siemens workers: “After undoubtedly a difficult couple of years that the country has had, actually now things are starting to feel better. “Confidence is returning to the economy and the country, and I hope that you’re starting to feel that too.” Sunak, and chancellor Jeremy Hunt, were shown Siemans machines at the factory and given a demonstration of the magnet technology being developed at Eynsham. The UK economy is likely to keep growing at a decent pace during the current quarter, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). They are predicting GDP will rise by 0.6% in April-June, matching the forecast-beating 0.6% expansion reported in January-March this morning. NIESR say: The fact that the UK’s GDP growth transitioned into positive territory after experiencing the shallow recession in the second half of 2023 is encouraging. However, the UK economy has largely flatlined following the initial stages of post-pandemic recovery. To escape the low-growth trend into a new and sustained era of high output growth requires structural changes and public investment. We expect that monthly GDP will continue its momentum in April, growing by 0.1 per cent relative to March, driven by growth mainly in services and production, particularly Agriculture. Indeed, the S&amp;P Global/CIPS UK services PMI reported an optimistic balance of 55.0 in April up from 53.1 in March. In line with this positive sentiment, we now forecast GDP to grow by 0.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2024, mainly driven by services sectors. The European Central Bank is poised to start cutting its key interest rates next month, the record of their last meeting show. The minutes of the ECB’s April meeting, where it left borrowing costs on hold, have been released – and show that policymakers were more confident that the “disinflationary process” was continuing. This indicates that the ECB’s governing council could vote for a rate cut next month, if new economic forecasts suggest inflation is indeed falling. The minute say: Members concurred that the most recent information had broadly confirmed the March staff projections, thus increasing their confidence that the disinflationary process was continuing At the same time, important new data – including new staff projections – would be released ahead of the June meeting, allowing the Governing Council to make a more comprehensive assessment. While progress had been seen, monitoring the triangle between wages, productivity growth and profits continued to be key. It was seen as plausible that the Governing Council would be in a position to start easing monetary policy restriction at the June meeting if additional evidence received by then confirmed the medium-term inflation outlook embedded in the March projections. Huw Pill also declines to say whether he was at the dovish, or hawkish, range of the seven MPC policymakers who voted to hold interest rates at 5.25% this week. Pill says the Monetary Policy Committee contains a healthy range of views, which are expressed fully and richly – a strength of the UK central bank, he explains. Pill also suggests it won’t be hard to find out where he lies on the hawk-dove range…. [the other six policymakers who voted for no change include governor Andrew Bailey, who was dropping dovish hints yesterday that rates might fall faster than expected. But noted hawks include Catherine Mann and Jonathan Haskel, who earlier this year both wanted to raise rates higher]. BoE chief economist Huw Pill also cautions that the Bank’s medium-term inflation forecasts don’t necessarily give a signal on rate moves at the next meeting (in June) or the one after (in August). Those forecasts suggest inflation will be below target at the end of the Bank’s forecast horizon. Pill also refuses to be lured by a question on the impact of the upcoming UK election. He tells the Bank’s agents that the central bank is independent, and makes its decisions without political influence. It’s forecasts are conditional on the announced policy of the government of the day, he adds. The Bank of England’s chief economist, Huw Pill, is briefing the Bank’s agents now following yesterday’s interest rate decision. Pill says the Bank has sent a “relatively clear signal” that it is comforted by recent falls in inflation, which do raise the prospect of reducing the amount of restrictive monetary policy in the system. But, if rates are to be cut, there needs to be sufficient evidence that the downward path of inflation is strong enough to justify it, Pill says. Pill explains that he is focused on the underlying components of inflation, not the headline rate – which dropped to 3.2% per year in March. He also suggests it’s “a little ill-advised” to just focus on the June meeting – reminding agents that governor Andrew Bailey said yesterday a June rate cut was neither ruled out nor a fait accompli. Will Britain’s strong recovery deter the Bank of England from cutting interest rates? Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at Axa, thinks not – and is expecting the first cut next month. Following today’s GDP report, Dickens told clients: More broadly, the recovery was the result of stronger households’ spending amid the recovery in real incomes and stronger demand underpinning a rebound in the manufacturing sector. Momentum is strong, and the composite Purchasing Managers’ Index remains consistent with growth of around 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in Q2. We have revised up our 2024 GDP forecast to 0.6%, from 0.4%. For now, we think the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee will largely look through the strength in activity, as long as inflation and labour market data evolve as it expects. We continue to forecast the first rate cut in June. The Bank should be focused on inflation, rather than GDP, as it’s mandate is to get CPI to 2% in the medium term. Yesterday, its latest forecasts showed that CPI inflation is on track to fall to 1.6% in three years, based on the current market path of interest rates (suggesting rates may need to fall faster than expected…). The first quarterly expansion in a year. Recession receding into the rear-view mirror. A stronger performance in recent months than the Bank of England and the City had thought likely. Faster growth in early 2024 than any other member of the G7 group of leading industrial nations. When you are in as deep a political hole as the current government you seize on any good news, and there was plenty for Jeremy Hunt to choose from in the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. The figures were proof that the economy was returning to “full health for the first time since the pandemic”, the chancellor said. Yet when people look back on the early months of 2024 they will probably remember the relentlessly awful weather rather than a time when the economy was cooking with gas. Boom-boom Britain it certainly isn’t. To be sure, the UK has emerged from recession but the downturn in the second half of 2023 was a much more modest affair than some of the monster downturns of the past 50 years. The hollowing out of manufacturing in the early 1980s was a genuine slump, as was the housing market crash in the early 1990s and the near collapse of the banks in the global financial crisis of 2008. The bigger picture is that Britain’s growth performance during the current parliament has been extremely weak….. More here: City economists are likely to upgrade their forecasts for UK growth during 2024, following this morning’s news of 0.6% growth in January-March. As Sky News’s Ed Conway points out, this is a welcome return to ‘trend growth’ Simon French of Panmure Gordon predicts this will trigger some growth upgrades: With independent consensus for UK growth of 0.4% in 2024 - we are at 1.2% YoY - then Q1 24 growth of 0.6% means that economist upgrades will [begrudgingly] emerge over the coming days. James Smith of ING suspects growth will only be slightly slower in the April-June quarter: The bottom line is that the economy is entering a brighter period. The timing of the March bounce provides a nice starting point for the second quarter, where growth could easily come in at 0.4% or 0.5%. Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool, has crunched the data, and tells us: Today’s first estimate of 0.2%, q-on-q4 growth for 2024Q1 is higher than yesterday’s estimate of -0.1% produced by the Bank of England. This will create a momentum effect which is bound to lift next quarter’s growth from q-on-q4 growth of 0% (as estimated by the BoE) to something considerably higher. Whether this momentum effect is able to generate additional inflation remains to be seen. As things stand, it is more likely than not that the Bank’s MPC will keep interest rates on hold in June. Needless to say, things might change until then! The stock market rally in London today has helped to lift the pan-European Stoxx 600 share index to a new alltime high. Hopes of interest rate cuts in the eurozone in June, and a strong earnings season, are both lifting shares. In Paris, the French CAC 40 has also hit a fresh record high this morning too (jumping 0.8% to 8256 points). The broad picture is that the UK economy is entering a period of stronger growth, says ING developed markets economist James Smith: “The UK economy powered out of its technical recession in the first quarter, judging by the initial GDP figures released today. The economy expanded by a whopping 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Admittedly the data underlying that number has been pretty volatile. Some caution should be taken when interpreting these figures, just like the weaker numbers at the end of last year. Still, it tallies with other economic indicators which suggest the economy is entering a period of stronger growth. The purchasing managers indices are the most obvious example, and these are consistent with continued momentum in the second quarter. Even here though, there is some debate over whether the numbers are being artificially boosted by “residual seasonality” (i.e., not properly adjusting for seasonal trends after the pandemic). The 2023 drop in GDP, now consigned to history, is the third UK recession in 16 years. The contraction in the third-and fourth quarter of last year follows the slump in the first half of 2020 during Covid-19 lockdowns, and the contraction from spring 2008 to summer 2009 during the financial crisis. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, says the recent frequency of recessions is a concern. “The UK swiftly exited its latest recession in 2024 with the strongest economic growth since late 2021. “But the wider backdrop is still worrying. Britain is falling into recession twice as frequently as it did in the second of the 20th century, and it remains a stagnation nation. These all-too regular shocks and slumps in between are reducing living standards and straining the public finances. “The battle of ideas on how to change this record should be key during the election campaign.” The odds of the Bank of England cutting interest rates next month have narrowed this morning. The money markets indicate that a June rate cut, to 5%, is now a 48% chance, while there’s a 52% possibility that the BoE holds rates at 5.25%. Yesterday, the decision was almost a coin-toss too, with a 55% chance of no-change in June. On Thursday the BoE left rates on hold, with two policymakers voting for a cut but seven choosing not to ease policy. Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at financial group Mitsubishi UFJ, says the BoE is inching toward a June rate cut He told clients: Most of the key guidance comments from [governor Andrew] Bailey and [deputy governor Ben] Broadbent in the press conference and again from Bailey in a Bloomberg TV interview after the press conference were clear in signalling rate cuts are coming. Mostly notable was Bailey’s Comment that the monetary stance would “likely” need to be made less restrictive and “possibly more so than currently priced into market rates”. That comment really couldn’t be much clearer in signalling where the bias is shifting within the MPC and in our view strengthens the prospect of a June cut. High interest rates are likely to weigh on growth this year, even if we do get the two quarter-point cuts which markets expect. Moody’s Analytics senior economist David Muir explains: “With inflation moderating, the Bank of England is signalling that a rate cut is on the cards for the summer. But first the Monetary Policy Committee needs further evidence that wage growth and price pressures within services are easing sufficiently. If that evidence builds quickly, a rate cut could come as soon as June, but we think August is the more likely date. That said, even as rates are lowered, they will remain a constraint on the pace of economic growth through this year.” Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is arguing that the UK’s GDP growth shows that the Government’s decisions are paying off. He told Sky News this morning: “We’re seeing that inflation is falling faster and I think people recognise it has been a very, very challenging period but they don’t vote for Conservative governments for us to do popular things, they trust is to do the right thing for the long-term benefit of the economy.” He told Radio 4’s Today Programme that families who have been through “a really tough time” can see that the “very difficult decisions” taken to get the economy back on its feet after the pandemic and the energ shock” are working. Hunt also claims that the UK’s longer-term prospects are strong – citing IMF forecasts for faster growth than France, Italy, Germany or Japan over the next six years. Hunt also disputed that the Conservative’s reputation for economic competence had been crushed by Liz Truss’s mini-budget. Hunt, who replaced Kwasi Kwarteng after the markets reacted very badly to the Truss administration’s package of unfunded tax cuts, concedes that mistakes were made, but that he corrected them within weeks. Hunt says: When interest rates and the prices people pay for mortgages have gone up all across the developed world following the energy shock caused by the invasion of Ukraine, it’s just wrong to attribute that to the mini-budget. Hunt also predicted that mortgage rates are likely to start to fall, as inflation drops towards the UK’s 2% target – which could allow the Bank of England to lower interest rates. Is Hunt right, though, that the mini-budget shouldn’t take the blame for the UK’s mortgage shock? It is true that morgage rates have risen in the US, and in the eurozone, as central banks have tightened monetary policy by raising interest rates. Looking back, the mini-budget triggered a massive selloff in government bonds – forcing the Bank of England to launch emergency action to halt a run on Britain’s pension funds. More than two-fifths of Britain’s mortgage deals were withdrawn in the week after the mini-budget, as lenders rushed to reprice them, higher. UK mortgage rates did fall in 2023, as the shock of the mini-budget subsided, but have been rising in recent weeks on concerns that interest rates might not be cut as soon as hoped (although the BoE suggested yesterday it could cut faster than expected). So, even if the Truss shock has now dissipated, some unlucky mortage-holders who had to refinance their loan shortly after the mini-budget ended up paying much more… Britain’s blue-chip share index has soared to another all-time high in early trading in London, amid relief that the UK’s recession is over. The FTSE 100 index has jumped over the 8400 point mark for the first time, hitting a new intraday high of 8425 points – up 45 points this morning. Mobile network operator Vodafone is the top riser, up 2%, after the UK cabinet office conditionally approved its merger with rival Three (although the competition authorities are yet to give their ruling). Mining companies are also in the top risers, along with luxury goods maker Burberry (+1.7%), airline easyJet (+1.4%) and housebuilder Berkeley (+1.3%) Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says today’s growth report is lifting confidence: The 0.6% growth registered in the first three months of the year was higher than forecast, with the green shoots seen in January and February flowering into a stronger growth spurt in March. Confidence breeds more optimism, and with the economy showing signs of repairing and the FTSE 100 rallying higher, the glass half full sentiment is settling in. The blue-chip index has powered higher in early trade and set fresh records, after a sheen of positivity has descended on the UK. The FTSE 100 has been on a strong rally since mid-April, and is on track for its third weekly rise in a row. It’s gained almost 9% so far this year. Hopes that the economy was strengthening, and that interest rates will be cut this year, have both pushed up share values in London in recent weeks. However, the FTSE 100 isn’t really a barometer of the strength of the UK economy, rather it is an outward-looking index comprising largely of multinational conglomerates. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says: “After the FTSE 100 hit a record high for the fourth straight session on Thursday, the UK index has opened higher yet again and is potentially on track to close at another all-time high. Shares in Anglo American are up on a report that Rio Tinto also considered a bid following BHP’s rejected offer. M&amp;A speculation is helping to keep Anglo shares supported at the moment. The UK has grown faster than many of its major rivals at the start of this year, as it emerged from recession. The 0.6% growth recorded in January-March is faster than the US, where GDP rose by 0.4%, Germany (+0.2%), France (+0.2%) or Italy (+0.3%). Out of the remaining G7 nations, Canada is estimated to have also grown by 0.6% in Q1, while economists predict Japan will have grown by 0.2%. Since the pandemic, the UK is one of the slower-growing economies, today’s GDP report shows: Although Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, reports that the UK is in bronze medal position since 2016: Britain’s “living standards recession” is also, finally, over, after a two year squeeze. Today’s GDP report shows that real GDP per head is estimated to have increased by 0.4% in the first quarter. This measure of GDP per capita divides UK GDP by the total UK population, to get a more accurate view of how living standards are changing. GDP per head had fallen steadily through 2023, and indeed hadn’t grown for seven quarters in a row. Even after rising by 0.4% in January-March, GDP per head is estimated to be 0.7% lower than a year ago. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak says: “The UK economy has stopped shrinking. But one quarter of decent growth won’t make up for 14 years of lost living standards. The Tories are still presiding over the worst period for economic stagnation and livelihoods in modern history. Real wages are worth less than in 2008 and working people will end this parliament worse off than at the start. Workers would be over £10,000 richer if pay had kept pace with its pre-crisis trend. The Conservatives have succeeded only in making families poorer.” City experts are welcoming the news that Britain’s economy has returned to growth. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, hopes that the UK’s economic stagnation will subside this year: “With interest rate cuts seemingly pencilled in for the summer, the good news continues to flow for the UK as today’s data shows the UK is out of recession. The first quarter saw GDP grow by 0.6%, better than expected, as inflation has eased and the worst of the cost-of-living crisis is behind us. The increase in GDP has primarily been driven by the UK’s strong services sector, which it has come to rely on in recent years to help push the economy forward. “While growth remains fairly lacklustre compared to the likes of the US, this data shows this should be the year that economic stagnation subsides in the UK and the economy returns to consistent, if unspectacular, growth. It is the unspectacular nature of the growth, however, that is likely to be focus. While the very shallow and short recession appears over, there is a clamour for interest rate cuts to begin in order to stimulate growth and get business moving again. Markets await the first interest rate cut with bated breath, so it will be interesting to see the economic reaction once those rate cuts begin feeding through. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, believes the worst is over, and that there will be continued growth for the rest of this year. Falling inflation and real pay increases should help repair some of the damage to household incomes and support households’ consumption. Growth prospects have also improved in Europe, which could spur a recovery in exports. “Despite the better near-term outlook, the improvement in GDP growth looks likely to be constrained by the ongoing weakness in productivity growth as well as reduced scope to increase employment levels. This could see annual GDP growth in the region of just 1% per year in the medium term. “UK GDP grew by 0.4% in March, supported by a rise in services output which grew by 0.5%. Forward looking indicators point to further momentum in the coming months, consistent with our view that the worst is behind the UK economy.” But… Suren Thiru, economics director of ICAEW, says the end of the recesion is a “rather hollow victory”, which could encourage the Bank of England to keep interest rates high for longer… “These figures confirm an easy exit from the shallowest of recessions for the UK, as lower inflation helped return the economy to growth in the first quarter. The UK’s escape from recession is a rather hollow victory because the big picture remains one of an economy struggling with stagnation, as poor productivity and high economic inactivity limits our growth potential. The economy could struggle to kick on further in the second quarter as the boost to people’s incomes from weaker inflation is partly curtailed by renewed caution to spend and invest, amid higher unemployment and ongoing political uncertainty. The strong exit from recession may inadvertently keep UK interest rates higher for longer by giving those policymakers still worried about underlying inflationary pressures enough comfort on economic conditions to continue putting off cutting rates.” Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has posted that it’s ‘time for change’. Following this morning’s GDP report, Reeves says: From no growth to low growth - is that really the scale of the Conservatives’ ambitions? Food prices are still high, families are paying more on their monthly mortgage bills and working people are worse off. Although most of the economy grew in the last quarter, there are some warning lights flashing in the construction sector. Construction output fell by 0.9% in January-March, for the second quarter in a row. That means construction is in recession; output is 0.7% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The fall reflects a decline in new work of 1.8% driven by private commercial new work, which fell by 5.3%. However, repair and maintenance increased 0.3%, which the ONS says may be due to housing associations re-directing their budgets towards repairs and upgrading “to deal with problems such as damp arising from tenants using less heating because of the higher cost of living”. Wet weather this year also dampened construction activity, as the swathe of storms kept workers off building sites. Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at Wealth Club, says: Construction remains the one area of weakness, particularly in the commercial sector. That’s no surprise. Real estate is particularly exposed to the effect of higher interest rates, and the upheaval of the pandemic is still rocking the office and retail sector - with increased home working and online shopping permanently changing demand. That’s not a trend that’s unique to the UK. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has hailed the news that Britain’s recession is over, saying: “There is no doubt it has been a difficult few years, but today’s growth figures are proof that the economy is returning to full health for the first time since the pandemic. “We’re growing this year and have the best outlook among European G7 countries over the next six years, with wages growing faster than inflation, energy prices falling and tax cuts worth £900 to the average worker hitting bank accounts.” I hate to burst the chancellor’s bubble, but the UK is also expected to be the worst-performing economy in the G7 next year. Still, these forecasts are there to be beaten…. ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown has told Radio 4’s Today programme that the 0.6% growth recorded in the last quarter is stronger than people expected. Compared to recent figures, we last saw growth this strong in the last quarter of 2021, McKeown explains. McKeown pointed to the pick-up in service sector growth, but also pointed out that construction shrank – due to a decline in new work. McKeown says: “After two quarters of contraction, the UK economy returned to positive growth in the first three months of this year. “There was broad-based strength across the service industries with retail, public transport and haulage, and health all performing well. Car manufacturers also had a good quarter. These were only a little offset by another weak quarter for construction. “In the month of March the economy grew robustly led, again, by services with wholesalers, the health sector and hospitality all doing well.” Growth in March alone was also stronger than expected. GDP rose by 0.4% in March, the ONS reports, beating City forecasts for 0.1% growth. The services sector had a good month, growing by 0.5% in March, while production output grew by 0.2%. Construction output fell by 0.4% in the month, though. February’s GDP data has been revised higher too, to show growth of 0.2% (up from 0.1% first estimated). Newsflash: The UK’s short, shallow, recession is over. The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the first quarter of this year, the Office for National Statistics has reported. That’s stronger growth than expected. The ONS says the recovery was driven by the services sector, and industry: In output terms, services grew by 0.7% on the quarter with widespread growth across the sector; elsewhere the production sector grew by 0.8% while the construction sector fell by 0.9%. In expenditure terms, there were increases in the volume of net trade, household spending and government spending, partially offset by falls in gross capital formation. This rise in GDP means that the economy is no longer in a technical recession, after activity fell in the third and fourth quarters of last year. GDP is the standard measure of economic activity, but it has its critics too. It tracks what’s happening across the economy, but does not distinguish between harmful and beneficial activity. Back in 1968, US presidential candidate Bobby Kennedy issued a magisterial rebuke, saying GDP ‘measures everything except that which is worthwhile’. Kennedy told the University of Kansas: It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman’s rifle and Speck’s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. You can hear the speech here; and here: In order to measure GDP, statisticians use three approaches: measuring the total value of goods and services produced; the total amount spent in the economy, and the total amount of income from profits and wages. All three methods should, in theory, give the same number. The Bank of England is confident that the UK recession has ended. Yesterday, the BoE said UK GDP is expected to have risen by 0.4% in the first quarter of this year, explaining: UK GDP growth had strengthened since the start of the year, reversing the fall in output that was estimated to have occurred in the second half of 2023. The [Monetary Policy] Committee expected the recovery in output to be underpinned by a pickup in household consumption, supported by higher real incomes. Good morning. We’re about to discover if Britain’s economy has clambered out of recession. New gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the first three months of this year are released at 7am, and City economists are hopeful that the economy expanded in the quarter. If so, that would mean that the shallow recession that began in the second half of last year has ended. A technical recession, in City jargon, is at least two quarterly falls in GDP in a row. As things stand (and data are often revised…) the UK economy shrank by 0.1% in July-September 2023, and then by 0.3% in October-December as consumer spending slumped, triggering the technical recession declared earlier this year. Analysts are expecting to learn that UK GDP rose by around 0.4% in the January to March quarter, which would consign the recession to history. Recent falls in inflation, and hopes that interest rates will be cut this summer, are supporting the economy. Previous data has shown that GDP rose by 0.1% in February, and 0.3% in January. Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, Sanjay Raja, says: The UK economy likely shrugged off the short and marginal technical recession it fell into last year. After contracting by 0.3% q-o-q in Q4-23, we expect the economy to bounce back, expanding by 0.4% q-o-q in Q1-24 with March GDP rising by 0.1% m-o-m. What’s driving the recovery? In short, some positive payback with household spending bouncing back to start the year. Government investment too will have likely supported GDP through the first quarter. And we think some build up in inventories will have also helped push GDP higher in Q1-24. In short, we expect Q1-24 to signal a sustained recovery back to trend growth. Where to now? We expect 2024 GDP to expand by 0.5%. There are some upside risks to our projection, given the continued strength of business activity data.

        "title": "UK has moved out of recession, official figures show ",
        "content": "The UK is officially out of recession after figures showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the first three months of the year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the period from January to the end of March marked a return to growth after a mild recession in the second half of 2023. It was the strongest rate of quarterly growth since the end of 2021, and a better performance than expected by economists, who forecast growth of 0.4% in the first quarter. The downturn came to an end after an increase in activity across the services sector, which has flourished since the turn of the year as wages have outstripped inflation, easing pressure on consumers. However, forecasters expect the UK to grow slowly this year as high interest rates and last year’s inflation surge continue to take their toll on disposable incomes. The Bank of England has predicted that a lack of momentum in the economy means gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by only 0.5% this year. The Bank kept interest rates unchanged at 5.25% on Thursday but indicated it may begin cutting them from June. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: “There is no doubt it has been a difficult few years, but today’s growth figures are proof that the economy is returning to full health for the first time since the pandemic.” Speaking after a trip with Hunt to a Siemens factory near Oxford, Rishi Sunak said it would take time for people to “really feel better”. “Of course there’s more work to do,” said the prime minister. “And I get that. And that’s why I’m keen to stick to our plan and keep delivering for people. But I think today’s figures show that we now have momentum.” Hunt said the UK had the best outlook among European G7 countries over the next six years, “with wages growing faster than inflation, energy prices falling and tax cuts worth £900 to the average worker hitting bank accounts”. However, apart from Germany, other eurozone countries avoided a recession last year. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said last week that the UK would be the worst performing economy in the G7 next year, as high interest rates and the lingering effects of last year’s surge in inflation drag on growth. Responding to the first-quarter GDP numbers, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said it was a case of going “from no growth to low growth”. She said: “This is no time for Conservative ministers to be doing a victory lap and telling the British people that they have never had it so good. The economy is still £300 smaller per person than when Rishi Sunak became prime minister.” The ONS said consumer spending and business investment recovered in the first quarter after declines across the second half of 2023. An increase in transport and storage services was the biggest driver of the 0.7% increase in the services sector. The boom in private healthcare and renewed activity in the NHS after a series of strikes last year were among the other factors pushing up services sector growth. Construction activity fell in response to a decline in housebuilding, while the manufacturing sector benefited from a recovery in car production. Textile factory output fell by 3.6% to register the sixth consecutive quarter fall. Energy production increased between January and March. However, the ONS said growth in this sector and manufacturing was partly offset by a fall of 2.4% in the output of activities associated with the big water companies, including sewage and waste management. Ruth Gregory, an economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the increase in GDP showed the economy had been recovering from last year’s contraction with more strength and momentum than was previously understood. But she doubted the increase in GDP would prevent the Bank of England from making its first interest rate cut in the summer. “At this stage we doubt the recovery will be strong enough to prevent inflation from falling further and the Bank from cutting rates to 3% next year,” she said. GDP per head is estimated to have increased by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024, after seven consecutive quarters without positive growth. It is estimated, based on ONS projections of the UK’s rising population, that GDP per head is 0.7% lower compared with the same quarter a year ago.",

        "content": "The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose cut 3,500 jobs last year amid efforts to save costs in a tough market – but employed its first group chief executive on a more than £1m pay deal. The staff-owned group, which has 34 John Lewis department stores and 329 Waitrose supermarkets, said it employed 72,900 people in its annual report published on Thursday, down from 76,400 a year before, helping to reduce its pay bill to £1.79bn from £1.82bn. Pay for the John Lewis Partnership (JLP) chair, Sharon White, remained steady at £1.12m, but the report indicates that its chief executive, Nish Kankiwala, who stepped into the role in March last year is now the highest paid director on £1.18m. A further unnamed director, thought to be the outgoing finance director, Bérangère Michel, is paid between £650,000 and £700,000, with all other board directors paid £150,000 or less. The bosses of Waitrose and John Lewis do not sit on the board and so their pay is not revealed in the annual report. Most staff cuts over the past year were in Waitrose stores after a rejig of shifts and some store management changes. JLP has indicated that further job cuts may be on the cards this year as it said it would be investing in automation and other technology as part of “simplifying the way we work”. The group, which calls its staff “partners” because they collectively own the business, is thought to be considering cutting up to 11,000 jobs over the next five years but said in March there was no target on how many roles would go. The company recently announced plans to close one of its Waitrose delivery warehouses, putting more than 500 jobs at risk. JLP’s annual report indicates that pay for directors is benchmarked against industry peers. A spokesperson for the company said: “The reduction in roles has mainly been through natural turnover. We have made significant progress in the last year to transform the business and return it to profitability; we are investing record amounts in our retail brands and we expect profits to grow further next year.” The group is in the midst of a turnaround plan under which it returned to profit this year but skipped paying its workers an annual bonus for the second year in a row. JLP announced in March it made a £56m pre-tax profit in the year to 27 January, compared with a £234m loss in the previous year. JLP plans to open its first new Waitrose stores in a decade and refurbish 80 more supermarkets while investing in technology to improve the John Lewis website and customer service for shoppers in stores. The group is braced for a further shake-up under the incoming chair, Jason Tarry, the former boss of Tesco’s UK business who starts in September, replacing White. White, who is stepping down before her five-year term ends in February next year, had been criticised for focusing too much on non-retail projects, including building homes to rent and expanding financial services, while the group’s main business languished. She has since scrapped a target of ensuring that 40% of JLP profits come from non-retail business by 2030.",

        "title": "Opening of Ikea’s Oxford Street store put back to spring 2025",
        "content": "Ikea has pushed back the opening of its Oxford Street store to spring 2025 – about 18 months later than initially planned – after problems with water leaking into the basement. The site, previously occupied by Topshop, had been scheduled to open this autumn and that date had already been put back by a full year. The company said the latest delay came because “a need for unforeseen additional work on the lower of the two basement levels was recently discovered to control water ingress, which is now under way”. Ikea’s parent group completed the purchase of the site, once the jewel in Sir Philip Green’s retail empire, for an estimated £378m in early 2022 but renovations have been dogged by complications. The store’s opening is seen as a key part of hopes for a revival of Oxford Street, where visitor numbers have fallen since the Covid pandemic and a number of sites are either vacant or occupied by cheap American candy shops. Peter van der Poel, the managing director of Ingka Investments, part of Ikea’s parent group, which now owns the building, said: “Ikea Oxford Street is a one-of-a-kind project, involving the sensitive and sustainable upgrade of a Grade II-listed building that is over 100 years old. “Following the discovery of an unforeseen water ingress issue, we’re now taking vital steps to mitigate long-term flood risk, and to protect and future-proof this historic building for many years to come.” He said the project, which aims to develop the former department store building into a gold-standard sustainable development, had moved “closer to the finish line” in recent months with the replacement of fossil-fuel gas-fired boilers with energy-efficient air-source heat pumps, as well as the installation of secondary glazing, the complete replacement of all wiring, plumbing and fire protection, and the conversion of the four upper floors into office space. The building’s frontage has also been cleaned, which involved the removal this month of a hoarding featuring a giant blue Ikea Frakta bag. Peter Jelkeby, the chief executive of Ikea’s UK business, said the store would have three floors with a total area of 82,000 sq ft (7,600 sq metres) and feature 6,000 products ranging from Billy bookcases to drinking glasses. About half of the products at the store will be able to be carried away, while larger furniture items will be delivered directly to customers’ homes. The site is also expected to include a cafe and a range of room sets on display. Jelkeby said: “The historic nature of the building makes its careful renovation more complex, but we want to ensure Londoners that we’re just as excited to open the store as they are to visit it. We look forward to doing so in spring 2025 and contributing to a positive future for London’s most renowned shopping district.”",

        "title": "Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant empire tripled losses to £3.4m last year ",
        "content": "Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant empire tripled losses to £3.4m last year as it spent millions of pounds on opening five new restaurants and the chef said businesses in the industry were “battling to stay afloat”. Sales at the celebrity chef’s dining establishments, which range from his Michelin-starred flagship Restaurant Gordon Ramsay to Street Burger, rose by 21% to £95.6m in the year to 27 August. The group took on 290 more staff after a tough time during the pandemic lockdowns. However pre-tax losses rose to £3.4m from £1.05m a year before after £4.9m of one-off costs, the vast majority of which related to pre-opening costs for new restaurants including a Lucky Cat outlet in Manchester, a Bread Street Kitchen outlet in Battersea power station and a Street Pizza outlet in Edinburgh. Ramsay also bought the Shoreditch eatery Pizza East. Underlying earnings excluding one-off costs, tax and write-downs rose to £8.3m from £6.2m. While losses worsened during the year, they still mark a turnaround from the pandemic which brought Ramsay’s business operations to a halt and forcing him to cut almost 300 jobs amid £12m in losses. Ramsay said: “It’s been a really hard-fought year, but at the same time an exciting year, and in tough times it amazes me how strong and vibrant our industry is. It’s challenging out there and businesses are battling to stay afloat, rising costs, rent and food costs, multiple strikes. It’s a battle. “However, I genuinely don’t think there’s been a year since I opened my first restaurant in 1998 where there has been so much passion and vibrancy in our industry. “People still want to go out, break bread and have a good time together. We’ve still got something wonderful to celebrate and I truly believe the industry has never been so exciting.” Ramsay, who opened his first solo venture Gordon Ramsay at Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea in 1998, said he was on track to surpass £100m of sales this year. He intends to opens five new restaurants within London’s new skyscraper 22 Bishopsgate – including Lucky Cat and its roof terrace on level 60, making it the capital’s highest restaurant. The development will also include an outpost of Bread Street Kitchen and Bar and a 14-seat chef’s table from Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, the chef’s Michelin-starred Chelsea venue and the Gordon Ramsay Academy, where culinary enthusiasts can hone their skills. Ramsay said: “This is more than just a new opening – it’s a significant milestone for our business. We’re not only launching the highest culinary experiences in London, but also creating a vibrant culinary hub at the incredible 22 Bishopsgate.” Ramsay also has an academy in Woking, Surrey, where the accounts note the local council loaned his group more than £1.6m in 2021, repayable over 25 years at 3.5%, to help with the fit-out of the venture and its neighbouring Street Burger restaurant.",

        "title": "Biden White House to expand tariffs on Chinese trade",
        "content": "Joe Biden is expected as early as next week to announce fresh tariffs on Chinese trade, with levies focused on strategic sectors including electric vehicles, in a review of measures first put into place under Donald Trump. An announcement planned for Tuesday will keep the blanket tax rises introduced by the president’s predecessor but supplement them with targeted levies on industries connected to EVs, including batteries and solar cells, according to reports. The plan, first reported by Bloomberg, would be the culmination of a review of the sweeping tariffs on Beijing that began in 2018. During his presidency, Trump imposed a 27.5% tax on imports of Chinese EVs that Biden has since extended, which has kept the number of Chinese-made cars on US roads extremely low. If introduced, the EV tariffs would represent one of Biden’s biggest moves in the trade war with China. Last month, the president launched an investigation into the Chinese shipping industry alongside a call for higher levies on Chinese steel and aluminium as part of an appeal to union workers before the presidential election in November. While China does not directly sell EVs in the US, it has majority stakes in other overseas firms that sell Chinese-made cars. Political leaders fear Chinese EV imports because China is able to undercut American manufacturers on price, while including more powerful batteries and advanced technology. The Alliance for American Manufacturing, an advocacy group, has said the introduction of Chinese cars to the US market would be an “extinction-level event” for US carmakers. The EU and the US are reeling from a deluge of cheaper imports from China off the back of President Xi Jinping’s strategy to ramp up manufacturing as he attempts to turn around the economy. The restrictions on imports of Chinese “smart cars” would also address security concerns, since many have modems that could be hacked. The White House has said that cars connected to the internet could use cameras and sensors to collect details on and interact with critical US infrastructure. In March, Trump said that if elected as president later this year he would put a 100% tariff on “every single car that comes across the line” from Chinese-owned manufacturing plants in China. “They are not going to sell those cars,” he said. He has promised to raise taxes on all Chinese imports by 60%, an approach critics say would raise prices for US consumers already grappling with inflation. In April, Biden said he was “not looking for a fight with China” but that the US needed to stand up to China’s “unfair economic practices and industrial overcapacity”. “I’m looking for competition, but fair competition,” he said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In October last year, the EU said it was investigating evidence that the Beijing government provides illegal financial assistance to the Chinese EV industry. The inquiry may result in the introduction of additional tariffs by July. Similar investigations found that Chinese e-bikes and fiber optic cables were also being subsidised by a margin of between 4% and 17%.",
