        "title": "Boohoo dives into debt as losses soar to £160m and sales slump",
        "content": "Boohoo has cut more than 1,000 jobs and dived into debt after its losses soared and sales slumped 13% amid heavy competition from the Chinese online seller Shein and the revival of the high street after the pandemic lockdowns. The online fashion specialist, which owns Debenhams, Warehouse, Dorothy Perkins and Pretty Little Thing, said it had built up net debts of £95m in the year to the end of February – down from almost £6m of net cash a year before – after losses widened 76% to £160m and sales fell to £1.8bn. Its chief executive, John Lyttle, blamed the group’s problems on “difficult market conditions, caused by high levels of inflation and weakened consumer demand”, and said it planned to make savings of £125m in the year ahead after putting more automation into its Sheffield warehouse, closing one in Daventry, and opening a new warehouse in the US. The latest accounts show that Boohoo, which was founded in Manchester in 2006, had cut more than 1,000 jobs in the year as it faced an 11% drop in the number of active customers using its site, each of whom spent less and visited less often. Stephen Morana, the new finance director of Boohoo, said the group had heavily cut investment in brands including Warehouse, Oasis, Wallis and Dorothy Perkins, which are now being sold through Debenhams rather their own websites. Boohoo wrote off £22.4m relating to the value of those brands, some of which were bought for £25m out of the collapse of Philip Green’s Arcadia Group in 2021. Morana said there was more competition from traditional retailers expanding online and the likes of Shein. But he added: “The business has faced into tough trading conditions and dealt with it as best it could and now hopefully there are some green shoots out there and a bit of consumer confidence is coming back.” He said the group had a “robust balance sheet”, with £130m of property and a stake in Revolution Beauty, and trading had improved in the second half of the year with sales of core brands – Boohoo, Debenhams, Karen Millen and Pretty Little Thing – down just 4%. “We see investment to take us to growth over the next 12 months,” Morana said. Boohoo’s share price fell and then recovered on Wednesday but is less than a tenth of its value three years ago, when it was riding high on a shift to online shopping during the coronavirus pandemic while high streets were affected by government lockdowns. The poor performance meant the company did not give 16m shares to shareholders of Pretty Little Thing, who are led by Umar Kaman, a son of the Boohoo co-founder and chair, Mahmud Kamani. The 16.1m share payment, promised under a 2020 deal, was only due if Boohoo’s share price hit 491p by March this year. If they had hit that level, Umar Kamani and his fellow Pretty Little Thing investors would have received about £79m in stock this year, just before his four-day wedding last weekend on the French Riviera involving performances from Andrea Bocelli and Mariah Carey. The company said: “While trading conditions have remained challenging due to cost inflation, uncertain consumer demand and normalisation of the channel shift online, the group has a strong business model and clear strategy which it is focused on executing to unlock market share.” Boohoo and other online sellers enjoyed a boom in demand during the pandemic, when many households turned to the internet to buy comfy clothing to work and rest at home while many high streets were shut down. With high streets reopened, and new competition from cut-price Chinese sellers Shein and Temu as well as secondhand marketplaces such as Vinted and Depop, once successful online fashion specialists have taken a hit. Lyttle said: “The group is now well positioned to return to growth, and we are focused on ensuring that growth is both sustainable and profitable.” Guy Lawson-Johns, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Boohoo’s full-year results were a painful read for investors. Revenue declined at high double-digit rates across all regions, including 18% in the US, which is seen as the group’s pathway to major growth. “For now, it remains a struggling company with a tarnished reputation, reflected in the group’s valuation, which has come down significantly over the last few years.”",

        "title": "Flame retardants in auto seats pose multiple health risks, research shows",
        "content": "The use of flame retardants in auto interior seats pollutes the air in car cabins with the highly toxic chemicals, putting those who spend significant time in cars at the most risk, peer-reviewed research in the US has found. About 99% of car-interior air samples contained at least one flame retardant the government considers a carcinogen or potential carcinogen, and most show additional, similar flame retardants linked to reproductive disorders and neurological problems, including reduced IQ in children. “Considering the average driver spends about an hour in the car every day, this is a significant public health issue,” said lead author Rebecca Hoehn, a Duke University researcher. “It’s particularly concerning for drivers with longer commutes as well as child passengers, who breathe more air pound for pound than adults.” Flame retardants are added to seat foam to meet regulations the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration implemented in the 1970s that require automakers to include flame retardants to prevent the ignition and spreading of fires. But the chemicals’ effectiveness was overstated at the time, and their toxicity was not understood. Flame retardants do “little to prevent fires for most uses and instead makes the blazes smokier and more toxic for victims, and especially for first responders”, said Patrick Morrison, director of the International Association of Fire Fighters’ safety division. The study checked air inside the cabins of 101 cars from model year 2015 or newer. Virtually all air samples contained 1-chloro-isopropyl phosphate, a flame retardant considered by the US National Toxicology Program to be a potential carcinogen. Most also showed organophosphate ester flame retardants, which in children are thought to cause asthma, early growth, adiposity and brain damage. Meanwhile, two of the chemicals are listed as California Proposition 65 carcinogens, and people with the highest levels of some flame retardants in their blood have about four times the risk of dying from cancer. The average US child has lost three to five IQ points from exposure to one flame retardant used in cars and furniture, epidemiological studies have shown. The research also found higher levels in the summer because seats give off gas at higher rates in warmer weather. Parking in shade or rolling down windows can help, but the study’s authors say the real solution is to eliminate the use of flame retardants in cars. As the flame retardants’ ineffectiveness has become clearer, some states have reduced their use in furniture, and the federal government has taken steps to begin limiting some classes of the chemicals.",

        "title": "Engineer Wood Group rejects £1.4bn bid from Dubai rival; TSB to shut 36 branches – as it happened",
        "content": "The British oil services company John Wood Group has rejected a £1.4bn takeover offer from Dubai-based rival Sidara, which it said “fundamentally undervalued” the company. Aberdeen-based Wood, which trades on the FTSE 250, is the latest British company on the London Stock Exchange to face takeover speculation amid growing concerns that UK-listed stocks are undervalued compared with other markets. High street bank TSB has revealed plans for 250 job cuts, prompting anger from unions including Unite, which called the move a “grave mistake”. The cuts will primarily affect staff in fraud operations, central operations, as well as staff in 36 branches, which are now set to be closed. Most of the decisions will be made by June, with staff leaving the bank from September onwards, according to Unite. A Boeing cargo plane has been forced to land at Istanbul airport without its front landing gear, in the latest setback for the embattled planemaker. Nobody was hurt in the incident, in a flight operated by the delivery company FedEx, according to Turkey’s transport ministry. James Watt, the co-founder and chief executive of BrewDog, is to step down after 17 years at the helm of the Scottish brewer and chain of bars. BrewDog, based in Ellon in Aberdeenshire, said Watt, who navigated the brewer’s meteoric rise from “punk” challenger to mainstream beer brand, informed the board last year of his plan to step back. Sir Jim Ratcliffe cited email traffic statistics to Manchester United staff as the basis for a ban on working from home and told them to seek “alternative employment” if they are not willing to come to club premises. United have had a flexible work-from-home policy since Covid but Ratcliffe signalled an end to this during an all-staff meeting held in person and via video call last week as part of his tour of Old Trafford and the Carrington training base. Alstom plans to raise €1bn (£861m) to help cut its debt as the world’s second largest train maker struggles with delayed orders amid concerns about the future of its Derby factory. The Paris-listed company will tap investors with the aim of raising the funds by September. It also plans a €750m bond issue as part of a €2bn new finance plan. AstraZeneca has begun the worldwide withdrawal of its Covid-19 vaccine due to a “surplus of available updated vaccines” that target new variants of the virus. The announcement follows the pharmaceutical company in March voluntarily withdrawing its European Union marketing authorisation, which is the approval to market a medicine in member states. More than 800,000 people in Europe and the US appear to have been duped into sharing card details and other sensitive personal data with a vast network of fake online designer shops apparently operated from China. An international investigation by the Guardian, Die Zeit and Le Monde gives a rare inside look at the mechanics of what the UK’s Chartered Trading Standards Institute has described as one of the largest scams of its kind, with 76,000 fake websites created. A trove of data examined by reporters and IT experts indicates the operation is highly organised, technically savvy – and ongoing. Boohoo has cut more than 1,000 jobs and dived into debt after its losses soared and sales slumped 13% amid heavy competition from the Chinese online seller Shein and the revival of the high street after the pandemic lockdowns. The online fashion specialist, which owns Debenhams, Warehouse, Dorothy Perkins and Pretty Little Thing, said it had built up net debts of £95m in the year to the end of February – down from almost £6m of net cash a year before – after losses widened 76% to £160m. The bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has said it will be able to repay creditors the full $11bn (£8.8bn) it owes, as the boom-bust cycle repeats itself with a sharp increase in bitcoin prices. John Ray III, who succeeded the disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried as the chief executive of FTX shortly after its collapse, said that once the exchange had sold off its remaining assets, it might have more than $16bn – well in excess of its debts. The e-gates failure that left thousands of passengers queueing at UK airports has been resolved, the Home Office has said while ruling out a cyber-attack as a cause. Airports said passengers could expect to travel smoothly again on Wednesday after widespread delays on Tuesday evening owing to a nationwide technical outage affecting UK Border Force e-gates. Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Manchester and Bristol airports all confirmed problems with passengers being processed through the border yesterday. Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Take care! – JK A little while ago, the FTSE 100 index hit a fresh record high, rising to 8,364.04. It is now trading at 8,338, up 0.3% on the day. Financial markets are fully pricing in a Bank of England interest rate cut by August, and see a 40% chance of a downwards move in June. The central bank will announce the outcome of this month’s meeting at noon tomorrow. Katharine Neiss, chief European economist and deputy head of global economics at PGIM fixed income, thinks that “the possibility of a rate cut on Thursday is not beyond the realm of possibilities”. She argues that “May is a forecast month” and that a “forecast publication months does allow more space for the Bank to communicate its views and outlook,” and reckons that April inflation could fall to or just below the central bank’s 2% target. European markets have made moderate gains, with Germany’s Dax up 0.1% and France’s CAC rising 0.6% while Italy’s FTSE MiB lost 0.67%. Crude oil prices are sliding, after industry data showed a rise in crude and fuel inventories in the US, according to Reuters, and as the US dollar strengthened, suggesting that demand for oil is coming under pressure. Brent crude oil futures fell 72 cents, or 0.9%, to $82.43 a barrel while US light crude dropped 71 cents, or 0.9, to $77.67 a barrel. Earlier, crude fell by more than $1 a barrel. Retail tycoon Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group is closing on on a deal for the struggling fashion chain Ted Baker, Sky News reports. Frasers Group has emerged as the preferred partner for the chain following the collapse into administration of No Ordinary Designer Label (NODL), Ted Baker’s current UK licensing partner. Frasers and NODL’s administrators hope to reach agreement on a deal in the coming days, Sky said, citing retail industry sources. The deal would add Ted Baker to Ashley’s sprawling retail empire, whose brands include Sports Direct, House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Gives &amp; Hawkes and Jack Wills. Next was also reportedly interested, along withTed Baker’s US licensing partner. Ted Baker still has dozens of shops in the UK, although NODL’s administrator, Teneo, was forced to close 15 Ted Baker stores last month with the loss of 245 jobs. John Wood Group is under pressure from a London-based activist investor, Sparta Capital Management, which is pushing for a sale of the business, or a move of its stock market listing to the US. Franck Tuil, who founded Sparta in 2021, said in a recent letter to Wood’s board that he was “frustrated by the continued underperformance of the shares . . . [which] languish at 130p — 140p, which, with the exception of just one occasion in the last five years, are the all-time lows,” the Financial Times reported. Tuil, a former senior portfolio manager at the New York hedge fund Elliott, added: If the UK public markets are unwilling or unable to engage in Wood’s story, we believe you should undertake a strategic review and actively seek alternative solutions. He said the US would “seem a logical potential listing venue”. He also said there had been an increase in M&amp;A activity this year and that financing markets “appear to be supportive of public to private transactions”. Tuil added that it was “time to recognise that the next chapter of Wood’s journey could be best supported by different owners”, and urged the group to “explore the best way to maximise shareholder value, including a sale of the company”. A Boeing cargo plane was forced to land at Istanbul airport on Wednesday without its front landing gear. Nobody was hurt in the incident, in a flight operated by delivery company FedEx, according to Turkey’s transport ministry. The Boeing 767 aircraft, flying from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, informed the traffic control tower at Istanbul Airport that its landing gear failed to open and it landed with guidance from the tower, the ministry said in its statement. Emergency services were standing by for the landing. The ministry did not give a reason for the landing gear’s failure. Video of the incident shows the plane’s back wheels touching down, followed by its fuselage, with sparks and smoke streaming from its underside. The plane then skidded to a halt, remaining on the runway. The runway where the cargo plane landed has been temporarily closed to air traffic, but traffic on the other runways at the airport was continuing without any interruption, the airport operator IGA said. The incident comes at a time when Boeing’s safety record is under intense scrutiny, after a string of crises and safety issues. Boeing said yesterday that it had informed regulators about possible failures to carry out mandatory safety inspections on its 787 Dreamliner planes. The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, said it was “investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records”. High street bank TSB has revealed plans for 250 job cuts, prompting anger from unions including Unite, which called the move a “grave mistake”. The cuts will primarily affect staff in fraud operations, central operations, as well as staff in 36 branches, which are now set to be closed. Most of the decisions will be made by June, with staff leaving the bank from September onwards, according to Unite. It is part of wider plans to cut costs and streamline the bank, announced earlier this yea. TSB said in a statement that it was part of efforts to meet “changing customer needs” and stay competitive. Unite regional officer Andy Case said: The decision by TSB to cut 250 roles is a grave mistake. These workers perform essential work in the fraud departments and across the branch network....TSB customers will rightly be concerned by today’s news and they will undoubtedly suffer a downgrade in service from these job cuts. Case said Unite would hold fresh negotiations with TSB about ways to further reduce job losses. Accord, another union representing TSB staff, said it had a number of concerns, including: remaining staff having to cope with increased workloads the impact of experienced staff leaving the business changes to business areas, shift patterns and reporting lines reduced career opportunities And for those working in branches that are closing or reducing hours, dealing with customers who will be disappointed with these changes plus branch clusters expanding with potential increases in travel time and costs A TSB Spokesperson said: To meet changing customer needs and for TSB to remain competitive, we are making changes to simplify the way we operate. These decisions are never taken lightly. Our priority is to consult with impacted colleagues to ensure they’re fully supported, maximising redeployment opportunities where we can. A list of the branches that are closing is here. John Wood Group has rejected a takeover offer from its Dubai-based engineering rival Sidara, formerly called Dar Group, as too low. Shares in the FTSE 250-listed company jumped as much as 26% earlier after a Bloomberg News report on the approach, and are now up 14% at 188.6p, valuing the company at £1.3bn. They are down 15% in the past year. The engineering firm, one of the North Sea’s biggest services companies, said it received an “unsolicited, preliminary and conditional” proposal from family-owned Sidara worth 205p per Wood share on 30 April. This valued the company at £1.42bn. The board carefully considered the proposal, together with its financial advisers, and concluded that it fundamentally undervalued Wood and its future prospects. Accordingly, the board rejected the proposal unanimously on 8 May 2024. There can be no certainty that any offer will be made for the company, nor as to the terms of any such offer, should one be made. Sidara’s official name is Dar Al-Handasah Consultants Shair and Partners Holdings. Early last year, the Aberdeen-based firm rebuffed three takeover approaches from the private equity group Apollo Global Management. Some grocery retailers are displaying inaccurate prices or failing to display prices at all for certain products, Britain’s competition watchdog has found, leading to shoppers spending more than they should. Missing prices, conflicting prices – when prices on products conflict with those on shelf labels – and prices not being displayed close to products, were the most common problems found by the Competition and Markets Authority in a review of 139 grocery stores in England and Wales. There were also issues with prices not being clearly legible, the selling price being obscured, and multibuy promotion labels that didn’t specify the price of the items individually. The CMA conducted on-site inspections and looked at a sample of products, such as fresh fruit and vegetables and products on promotion. Most of the issues were found at independent food stores and symbol convenience stores (small, independent retailers that operate under a symbol brand name). The percentage of pricing errors found at each type of store were: Supermarkets: 4.2% Symbol convenience stores: 14.4% Variety stores: 5.6% Independent food stores: 7.8% Overall, 60% of the errors resulted in a higher price being charged at the till. George Lusty, interim executive director for consumer protection and markets at the CMA, said: We know how frustrating it can be when you get to the till only to find the price doesn’t match what was advertised. While lots of grocery retailers – particularly supermarkets – are complying with pricing rules, this needs to consistently be the case across all types of stores. It’s important that shoppers can make well-informed choices based on accurate information, especially at a time when lots of people are looking to save money. That’s why we are reminding businesses of the importance of complying with consumer law. The watchdog has published compliance materials aimed at helping grocery retailers understand what they need to do to comply with the law. The CMA is also calling on the relevant trade associations to share these materials with their members. The London Eye, one of London’s most recognisable tourist attractions, can permanently remain on London’s South Bank after the local council confirmed the long term future of the iconic structure. Lambeth councillors have agreed to discharge a condition attached to the attraction’s original 2003 planning permission that had required the local authority to decide whether the attraction could be retained beyond 2028. Lambeth Council has agreed that the London Eye can remain in place – with current arrangements continuing beyond 2028. This includes a requirement for 1% of the attraction’s annual turnover to be paid towards the maintenance and management of the public area surrounding the site. Merlin Entertainments – the UK-based owner and operator of the attraction now known as the Lastminute London Eye – welcomed the decision. Scott O’Neil, chief executive of Merlin, said: It is impossible to imagine the London skyline without the iconic structure of the London Eye, and with its long-term future secure, we will continue to invest and expand Merlin’s presence. AstraZeneca’s share price rose 1.6% after Britain’s biggest drugmaker announced it is withdrawing its Covid-19 vaccine around the world. The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said it has begun the worldwide withdrawal of its Covid-19 vaccine due to a “surplus of available updated vaccines” that target new variants of the virus. The announcement comes after the pharmaceutical firm in March voluntarily withdrew its European Union marketing authorisation, which is the approval to market a medicine in member states. On 7 May, the European Medicines Agency issued a notice that the vaccine is no longer authorised for use. AstraZeneca said the decision was made because there is now a variety of newer vaccines available that have been adapted to target Covid-19 variants. This had led to a decline in demand for the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is no longer being manufactured or supplied. According to independent estimates, over 6.5 million lives were saved in the first year of use alone and over 3bn doses were supplied globally. Our efforts have been recognised by governments around the world and are widely regarded as being a critical component of ending the global pandemic. We will now work with regulators and our partners to align on a clear path forward to conclude this chapter and significant contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic. Other countries have already stopped supplying the vaccine. It has not been available for use in Australia since March 2023, though its use was already being phased out from June 2021 due to the widespread availability of newer vaccines. Although the vaccine was found to be safe and effective overall, it carried the risk of a rare but serious side-effect, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The rare syndrome occurred in about two to three people per 100,000 who were vaccinated with the Vaxzevria vaccine. The boss of Brewdog, James Watt, is stepping down from the top job 17 years after he co-founded the Scottish brewer and pub group. He is handing over the reins to chief operating officer James Arrow. Watt will stay on the board as a non-executive director, and advise the group on strategy. He first told the board last year that he wanted to focus on his other interests. He takes on a newly created non-executive role of “captain and co-founder” and retains his 21% stake in the firm. BrewDog chairman Allan Leighton said: James Watt, alongside Martin Dickie, created this great business from a garage in Fraserburgh. Few have accomplished what he has. From very humble beginnings under his leadership, BrewDog has grown to become the world’s leading craft brewer, employing 2,530 people across its head office, four breweries and over 120 bars. I am especially pleased he will continue to offer his insight, creative genius and energy to the board. However, in 2021 the firm was accused by former workers in an open letter of having a “culture of fear” within the business, with “toxic attitudes” towards junior staff. And in January, BrewDog faced anger from its employees after dropping out of the accredited real living wage scheme – hiring new staff on the legal minimum instead and freezing pay for bar staff in London as the company tries to reduce costs amid continuing losses. France’s Alstom has announced a €1bn capital raise to help cut debt as the world’s second largest trainmaker struggles with delayed orders amid concerns about the future of its Derby factory. The Paris-listed company plans to raise €1bn from investors which it hopes to complete by September as well as a €750m bond issue, as part of a €2bn deleveraging plan to cut debt. Alstom has already announced disposals as part of the plan. These include the sale of its stake in railcar manufacturer TMH for €75m in January and offloading its North American signalling business to Germany’s Knorr-Bremse for €630m. Alstom said it had net debt of €2.99bn at the end of March, up from €2.13bn a year earlier. Its debt pile and cashflow problems have raised concerns about the future of its train factory in Derby which it bought from Canada’s Bombardier in 2021, in a deal that made it the world’s second largest train manufacturer after China’s CRRC. A slowdown in orders last year led to fears about the future of the Derby site where 1,300 jobs were put at risk but there are now hopes that the future of the historic site, where manufacturing has taken place since 1876, could be safeguarded. Last month transport secretary Mark Harper met with Alstom officials and announced that the UK’s Department of Transport had reached “agreement in principle” with Alstom to support funding for a further five Elizabeth Line trains, in addition to the five trains confirmed in March. He added that he was confident “a solution is now in sight”. James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, said: The Riksbank has cut rates for the first time but is treading carefully amid ongoing concerns about the risk of a weaker currency. However, with Sweden’s interest rate-sensitive economy coming under greater pressure, further rate cuts look inevitable later this year. The fact that the Riksbank has chosen to move today – and crucially ahead of the ECB – is telling. The Riksbank has been very sensitive to the value of the currency and this was one of the principal reasons for hiking aggressively over the past couple of years. Policymakers went as far as saying that they needed to stay out in front of the ECB during the hiking cycle. These fears about the krona have clearly not evaporated entirely. Governor Thedeen has repeatedly signalled that a weaker currency is the major risk to inflation, a line repeated in the latest policy statement. Presumably for this reason, the committee is pushing back on the idea that it could cut rates at back-to-back meetings, continuing to signal its intention to cut rates just twice more this year. Yet to some extent we think actions speak louder than words, and the fact the Riksbank has cut rates today tells us that domestic economic concerns are starting to dominate the debate within the policy committee. Sweden’s economy has contracted for four quarters in a row now, while the jobs market is cooling more appreciably than elsewhere. By one measure, corporate bankruptcies are the highest since 1996. Core inflation, while still high in some domestically-focused areas, is now much closer to target. Daniel Kral, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said about the Riksbank’s interest rate cut today: The Riksbank cut the policy rate by 0.25bps to 3.75% at its May meeting, in line with our expectations. Inflation has surprised on the downside recently and is close to target, longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored, wage rises are moderate, and the economy is weak. These were the factors that tilted the balance for the Riksbank to start the easing cycle. The Riksbank expects to lower the policy rate twice more this year, while we expect three more cuts. As before, the language remains cautious, highlighting risks related to the strength of the US economy, geopolitical tensions, and a weak krona, which has weakened this year. There are no new forecasts accompanying the decision. We think inflation will continue to develop favourably although the Riksbank is likely to stay on hold at its next meeting at the end of June. We expect one rate cut in third quarter and two in the fourth quarter, with an end-year policy rate of 3%. Strong demand for Guinness and ale has pushed up sales at the UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon and prompted it to upgrade its profit outlook. The company’s founder and chairman Tim Martin said the firm now expects annual profits to be “towards the top of market expectations”. Wetherspoons, which runs 809 pubs across the UK, said like-for-like sales climbed by 5.2% over the 13 weeks to April 28 compared with a year earlier, with total sales up 3.3%. This marked a slight slowdown in growth and means the company has seen a 6.5% sales increase in the year so far. However, Wetherspoons explained it was impacted by the timing of the bank holiday weekend, which fell outside of the latest quarter this year in contrast to last year. Martin said the group has benefited from the popularity of Guinness among younger punters, and a revival for some traditional ale. Sales in the period continued the steady recovery from the pandemic. Traditional ales, which were very slow in the aftermath of the lockdowns, are increasing momentum, with Abbot Ale, Ruddles Bitter and Doom Bar showing good growth, as indeed are ales from the many small and micro brewers with which we trade. The gods of fashion have smiled upon Guinness, previously consumed by blokes my age, but now widely adopted by younger generations. The group also saw strong sales of Au Vodka and XIX vodka among its younger customers. Martin said wine is “on the comeback trail” and highlighted “increasing” sales of the pub chain’s Lavazza coffee refills, adding: Free refills are thought to be responsible for spontaneous exhibitions of breakdancing among retired customers. The Swiss National Bank was the first major central bank in the developed world to cut borrowing costs, lowering its key rate from 1.75% to 1.5% in March, in a surprise move. The Czech and Hungarian central banks have also cut interest rates. Sweden’s Riksbank has now also reduced rates, as inflation and economic activity have weakened. The question is which central bank moves next. The European Central Bank has signalled a rate cut at its next meeting on 6 June if price pressures continue to wane as expected. With US inflation remaining higher than expected, the US Federal Reserve has signalled that it is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer. In the UK, financial markets are pricing in the first rate reduction by August, and another cut before the end of the year, probably in November. The Bank of England base rate is at 5.25%. Some on its monetary policy committee are concerned that the improving economy could trigger a return to inflation later in the year. Inflation slowed to 3.2% last month, but remains above the Bank’s 2% target. Sweden’s Riksbank has cut its policy rate to 3.75% from 4%, its first interest rate reduction in eight years. Financial markets had been expecting the move. The central bank said it expects to reduce rates two more times in the second half of this year. Its statement said: Inflation is approaching the target while economic activity is weak. The Riksbank can therefore ease monetary policy. The executive board has decided to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.75%. If the outlook for inflation still holds, the policy rate is expected to be cut two more times during the second half of the year. You can read the statement in full here. Governor Erik Thedéen and Åsa Olli Segendorf, head of the monetary policy department, will explain the decision and the outlook at a press conference at 11am local time (10am BST). The minutes of the meeting will be published on 15 May. Milo Bussell, associate analyst for consumer and media at Edison Group, said: Moving forward, it will be interesting to see how consumer demand evolves in the coming year. Management noted improving momentum in sales... Having opened its new US distribution centre to target a key market and completed its automation project in Sheffield, the company believes it is well-positioned having invested for sustainable and profitable growth. With greater cost savings and lower capital expenditure having completed these two projects, management is confident in achieving its medium-term Ebitda margin target of 6%-8% and expects to be free cash flow positive in 2024/25. Boohoo has cut more than 1,000 jobs and dived into debt after losses soared and sales slumped 13% amid heavy competition from Chinese online seller Shein and the revival of the high street after the pandemic lockdowns. The online fashion specialist, which owns Debenhams, Warehouse, Dorothy Perkins and Pretty Little Thing, said it had built up net debts of £95m in the year to the end of February from nearly £6m of net cash a year before after losses widened 76% to £160m. John Lyttle, the chief executive of Boohoo blamed “difficult market conditions, caused by high levels of inflation and weakened consumer demand,” for the group’s problems and said it planned to make savings of £125m in the year ahead after putting more automation into its Sheffield warehouse, closing one in Daventry and opening a new warehouse in the US. The latest accounts show that Boohoo, which was founded in Manchester in 2006, has already cut more than 1,000 jobs in the year as it faced an 11% drop in the number of active customers using its site each of whom spent less and visited less often. Boohoo’s share price fell 4.6% and is less than a tenth of its value three years ago when it was riding high on a shift to online shopping during the pandemic when high streets were affected by government lockdowns. The poor performance meant the company did not hand 16m shares to shareholders of Pretty Little Thing who are led by Umar Kamani, son of the Boohoo co-founder and chairman Mahmud Kamani. Guy Lawson-Johns, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Boohoo’s full-year results were a painful read for investors. Revenue declined at high double-digit rates across all regions, including an 18% in the US, which is seen as the group’s pathway to major growth. For now, it remains a struggling company with a tarnished reputation, reflected in the group’s valuation, which has come down significantly over the last few years. Executing its back-to-growth strategy hasn’t been easy. And, as part of the drive for profitability, Boohoo has heavily invested in expanding capacity abroad where there’s greater room for growth. International markets, especially the US, hold the key to the group’s future growth, but extensive investment has so far yielded weak results. And with customer KPIs continuing to trend in the wrong direction, it doesn’t look like a miraculous recovery is around the corner. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. There’s more disruption for rail passengers in England today, after train drivers began another round of industrial action on Monday to push for better pay and conditions. In a three-day strike, drivers in the Aslef union will strike for 24 hours at each of England’s national train operators over the course of three days from Tuesday until Thursday, and an overtime ban will apply nationwide from Monday until Saturday. The first wave yesterday affected commuter routes into London. Today, there’s a 24-hour strike at Avanti West Coast, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Great Western Railway and West Midlands Trains – halting most services in the west of England, Midlands and routes to Scotland and Wales. Tomorrow, drivers will strike at LNER, Northern and TransPennine Express. The union is pushing for an improved pay offer, with some of its members not having had a pay rise for five years. The last talks broke down a year ago. The Rail Delivery Group, representing train operators, emailed Aslef late last week to suggest discussions about a framework for formal talks, which the union said it welcomed. Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, has forecast a near-20% drop in annual profit, after safety scandals forced it to cut back production. The Japanese carmaker plans to invest 1.7tn yen (£8.8bn) in electric vehicle and artificial intelligence technology to keep up with rivals. Honda and Nissan, Japan’s second- and third-largest carmakers, recently joined forces to work together on electric vehicle technology. Toyota said operating income will fall by 19.7% to 4.3tn yen in the year to March 2025, which is worse than expected. It also said it would buy back up to 1tn yen, around 3% of its shares.

        "content": "A Boeing cargo plane has been forced to land at Istanbul airport without its front landing gear, in the latest setback for the embattled planemaker. Nobody was hurt in the incident, in a flight operated by the delivery company FedEx, according to Turkey’s transport ministry. The Boeing 767 aircraft, flying from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport on Wednesday, informed the traffic control tower at Istanbul airport that its landing gear had failed to open and it landed with guidance from the tower, the ministry said. Emergency services were standing by for the landing. The ministry did not give a reason for the landing gear’s failure and said its teams were conducting examinations at the scene as part of an investigation. Video of the incident shows the plane’s back wheels touching down, followed by its fuselage, with sparks and smoke streaming from its underside. The plane then skids to a halt, remaining on the runway. The runway has been temporarily closed to air traffic, but traffic on the other runways at the airport was continuing without interruption, the airport operator IGA said. The incident comes at a time when Boeing’s safety record is under intense scrutiny, after a string of crises and safety issues. Boeing on Tuesday said it had informed regulators about possible failures to carry out mandatory safety inspections on its 787 Dreamliner planes. The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, said it was “investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records”. It followed separate allegations by a whistleblowing engineer that Boeing took shortcuts to reduce production bottlenecks while making the 787. The US manufacturer pledged this year to turn around its safety culture after a door panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max plane in mid-air in January. Boeing had been trying to ramp up production of the 737 Max, its bestselling model, to move beyond the crisis triggered by two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019. 737 Max planes were grounded worldwide for the best part of two years. FedEx was approached for comment on Wednesday’s incident. Boeing declined to comment.",

        "title": "‘It’s the brand speaking to you’: the scent firms making smells for Subway, Abercrombie and more",
        "content": "When Dallas Pratt worked at an outpost of Aesop in an outdoor shopping mall outside Chicago, one of her and her co-workers’ favorite ways of drawing in new customers was making a concoction they called “sidewalk tea”. They would put a few drops of scented lotion in a cup of hot water, and then they would pour it on to the slab of concrete outside the shop. As the water evaporated, the smell of the lotion would fill the air. “It drew people in,” Pratt tells me. “They asked questions. They spent time.” And, crucially, they bought stuff. This isn’t a novel marketing trick: stores that sell items with distinctive smells, such as perfumeries and bakeries, have been pumping smells out into streets and shopping malls probably since the beginning of retail. But starting in the 1990s, sense marketing became a more organized discipline, and now dozens of firms exist to help store owners develop distinctive custom smells. But sidewalk tea, for Pratt, was also about creating an experience: “It was about hospitality more than ambience.” The salespeople would treat customers as though they were welcoming them into their own living rooms, offering drinks and chatting about things other than the products. The idea was to make people want to be inside Aesop, even if they’d gone to the mall with no intention of buying hand lotion. As in-person retail continues to recover from the pandemic-era lockdowns, store owners and marketers are working hard to press the main advantage analog shopping has over digital: its appeal to all the senses. The most primal sense of all, the one that imprints most deeply on our memories, is smell. The brain processes odors in the olfactory cortex, located directly behind the nose and connected to key structures in the limbic system, including the amygdala, which forms emotional responses, and the hippocampus, which stores memories. “No other sensory system co-opts the limbic system of the brain the way smell does,” says Rachel Herz, a neuroscientist at Brown University who also advises corporations about their scent strategy. “It’s doing the work of perception, emotion, emotional memory, learning and association.” Because smell is so closely linked with memory, not everyone will have the same reaction to a particular scent. While many people find the smell of lavender soothing, for instance, those who connect it to unpleasant memories may feel the opposite. This is another reason brands take the time and trouble to create unique scents that will be connected to them alone. Aradhna Krishna, a professor of marketing at the University of Michigan, was one of the first researchers to study the intersection between the senses and branding. Two or more senses working in tandem, she discovered, are more powerful than one working alone: a photo of a chocolate chip cookie is nice, but that photo combined with the smell of cookies baking is likely to make you drool. “Smells within products can enhance the memory of other attributes,” she says. “You remember brand names, what the shape of the product was, where you used it. The smell is uniquely related to the product.” Even a gentle ambient smell has an effect. In one experiment, Alan Hirsch of the Smell and Taste Research Foundation placed two identical pairs of Nike running shoes in separate rooms that were also identical, except that one was scented and one was not. Customers were 84% more likely to buy the shoes in the scented room. (Nike, however, was dubious: “The big thing we try to do is get athletic shoes not to smell,” a spokeswoman told the New York Times at the time. Though it could be argued that new running shoes have an appealing smell all their own.) Other experiments have shown that customers in pleasant-smelling spaces – not just stores, but also casinos and hotel lobbies – spend more time there without realizing it, take more time to examine specific products, and are more likely to spend more money, including on impulse purchases. In some cases, customers are unaware that they’re smelling something that’s been specially designed to appeal to them: “new car smell”, for instance, is entirely artificial and has nothing to do with paint or upholstery. How does a brand create the ideal signature scent? It’s a lengthy and complex process, says Neohni Gilligan, the director of fragrance and product marketing at ScentAir, one of the world’s largest scent marketing companies. It begins with a 50-100 item questionnaire for the client, though only one or two of those questions relate specifically to scent. The rest are about decor, colors, lighting, sound and music, customer demographics and the brand’s overall ethos. Some pairings seem obvious: a furniture shop may want to play up the smell of leather while Cinnabon should smell like fresh cinnamon rolls are baking just a few feet away (at Cinnabon stores, ovens are placed near the doors of the store so that the smell escapes into the street; when the company trialled a location with ovens placed at the back, sales decreased significantly). Other scents are more about evoking feelings, but while a hotel lobby and a spa can both smell “relaxing”, in practice, these require a very different bouquet of scents. Once Gilligan outlines the characteristics of a scent, she passes it along to ScentAir’s fragrance partners, who do the actual formulation, taking care to follow local safety guidelines because no smell is more memorable – in a bad way – than the one that caused a severe allergic reaction. The next step is determining the intensity of the scent. Should the customer be bombarded by fragrance, as they are at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, which has been blasting its Fierce cologne for more than 20 years, or is the brand going for something more subtle that leaves more of a lingering impression? “Sometimes,” says Caroline Fabrigas, CEO of Scent Marketing Inc, a scent branding firm, “true success is if the customer doesn’t think it smells of anything. It’s the brand speaking to you.” Unlike perfumes, whose scents can evolve in conjunction with the wearer’s body chemistry, commercial smells need to remain constant. Scent marketers plan how the smell will be dispersed throughout the space. Sometimes they use the HVAC system, or introduce a visual element such as a candle or a reed diffuser. In the case of Singapore Airlines, the marketing team also incorporated the brand smell into soaps and hot towels. More often, though, spaces use strategically located mechanical diffusers, controlled through smartphones, that can be programmed to pump out scent at different times during the day. My local grocery store, for instance, starts smelling like rotisserie chicken in the afternoon, when shoppers are starting to think about dinner. The total cost of scent branding varies, based on the size of the space and the complexity of the smell, ranging from $1,000 to many, many times that. Olivia Jezler, founder of the scent marketing firm Future of Smell, says stores spend millions of dollars on visual branding and music, and scent leaves a much more lasting impression than sound. “At a lot of stores, especially cheaper stores like Zara, we can smell the plastic and the materials in the wall,” she says. “Subconsciously, that’s telling us something: no matter how much money is put into visual branding, this is something uncomfortable, something not safe and not good for us.” Retail stores are still trying to find their way back from the pandemic, and both Fabrigas and Jezler believe that the next generation of flagship stores will be different from their predecessors. “During the pandemic, people weren’t able to be out in public and they wanted to be,” says Fabrigas. “Retail gives them reasons to come out and play. Stores won’t be just places to buy, they’ll also be places to have this visceral, immersive experience.” Fabrigas already has experience with this sort of space: she designed scents for the Museum of Ice Cream. The brand experience can extend beyond the confines of a particular space and into the realm of e-commerce. Jezler thinks retailers are missing a huge opportunity by not including scent in their packaging. “Companies are spending a lot of money on beautiful unboxing experiences,” she says. “I ordered something from Chanel the other day, and I thought, ‘The packaging is so beautiful, but where’s the smell?’” It wouldn’t have been hard for the company to embed its signature No 5 scent into the packaging and connect, on an emotional level, to the customer at home. On Friday afternoon, I went shopping in downtown Chicago, not to buy anything, but simply to smell. Zara on Michigan Avenue didn’t smell like plastic, exactly; more like cardboard and glue, but Jezler was still correct: it smelled temporary, like nothing on the racks had been made to last. At Ralph Lauren, candles in the company’s Green scent were available for purchase. Over on nearby Rush Street, Tommy Bahama reeked of coconut and someone’s idea of the tropics, Urban Outfitters smelled of cardboard mixed with grill smoke from the bar next door, and Abercrombie was Fierce as ever – Herz suggests that it’s been around so long, it’s actually become a nostalgic smell to former customers who are now the parents of teenage shoppers. Meanwhile Garrett Popcorn and Subway pumped their distinctive odors of burned sugar and overly sweet bread on to the sidewalk outside their storefronts,. On Oak Street, lined with high-end designer boutiques, smells are more subtle, barely there, like “quiet luxury” and money itself; they’re mostly detectable in contrast to unpleasant outside odors like asphalt and car exhaust. At Chanel, this is deliberate: the stronger and more distinctive scents are confined to the area near the cosmetics counter. “We keep smells low to avoid sinus issues for customers and employees,” an employee told me. By contrast, Dior was arranged so that the combined aromas from the first-floor perfume display permeated throughout the entire store. Armani was also deliberately scentless. A previous location on Michigan Avenue had smelled of Armani’s Bois d’Encens fragrance, said Antony de Angelo, a longtime employee who had worked in both stores. The scent was inspired by the designer’s childhood in Italy, specifically church, and it gave the space an international feel: for Europeans, it was a familiar smell in a faraway place, while for Americans, it evoked foreign travel. Like Pratt, De Angelo considered the fragrance another way to welcome customers. “The smell was a talking point,” he said. “It was subtle, but people would always comment on it. They could sense it was something out of the ordinary. We don’t have the smell at the new store. I miss it.”",

        "content": "Alstom plans to raise €1bn (£861m) to help cut its debt as the world’s second largest train maker struggles with delayed orders amid concerns about the future of its Derby factory. The Paris-listed company will tap investors with the aim of raising the funds by September. It also plans a €750m bond issue as part of a €2bn new finance plan. Alstom finances have been in the spotlight after clients, including some in Britain, delayed putting in orders, raising concerns over its cashflow and the future of its train factory in Derby. It bought the site from Canada’s Bombardier in 2021 in a deal that made it the world’s second largest train manufacturer after China’s CRRC. The slowdown in orders last year led to fears about staff at the plant as 1,300 jobs were put at risk. However, there are now hopes that operations at the historic site, where manufacturing has taken place since 1876, can be safeguarded. Last month the transport secretary, Mark Harper, met Alstom executives and announced that the UK’s Department for Transport had reached an “agreement in principle” with Alstom to support funding for a further five Elizabeth line trains, in addition to the five confirmed in March. He added that he was confident “a solution is now in sight”. Alstom has also been affected in the UK by uncertainty over an order for new trains for HS2, after Rishi Sunak scrapped the northern leg of the high-speed line initially proposed from London to Manchester. The trains were due to be built in Derby and at a Hitachi factory in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. Alstom is also paring back its operations as part of the debt-cutting plan. The strategy has led to the sale of its stake in the railcar manufacturer TMH for €75m in January and offloading its North American signalling business to Knorr-Bremse for €630m in a deal that is expected to be completed this year. Alstom, announcing its full-year results, said its net debt position was at €2.99bn on 31 March compared with €2.13bn a year earlier. Alstom said it booked €18.9 bn of orders between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024 against €20.7bn the previous year. Adjusted net profit fell to €44m against €292m the previous year. Henri Poupart-Lafarge, the chair and chief executive, said: “Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562m free cashflow generation.” The UK government chose Derby in March to be the headquarters of its new rail regulator, Great British Railways, in part because of the city’s heritage. The Derby factory has built rolling stock for railways across the UK and most recently, London’s Elizabeth line.",

        "title": "BrewDog’s James Watt to step down as chief executive of beer company",
        "content": "James Watt, the controversial co-founder and chief executive of BrewDog, is to step down after 17 years at the helm of the Scottish brewer and bar chain. Watt, who navigated the Aberdeenshire-based brewer’s meteoric rise from “punk” challenger to mainstream beer brand, informed the board last year of his plan to step back. He will now be replaced by the company’s chief operating officer, James Arrow, who is expected to focus on returning the loss-making company to profit. Watt still owns 21% of the business and will hold the newly created title “captain and co-founder”, as well as remaining a non-executive director and continuing to advise on strategy. His departure comes after several controversies over the group’s treatment of staff that have complicated its long-held ambition of floating on the stock market. But the brewer’s co-founder said he was stepping down to make more time for travel, friends and family, and to focus on new business ventures. In a LinkedIn post, Watt said: “During my time at the helm of BrewDog, there have been highs and lows, up and downs, crazy successes and incredibly hard challenges. “When I look back on the last 17 years (119 dog years) my overwhelming feeling is one of gratitude.” Watt and his co-founder, Martin Dickie, started BrewDog in 2006 in Dickie’s mum’s garage in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, naming it in honour of Watt’s late chocolate labrador, Sweep. A series of risque but carefully orchestrated publicity stunts helped the business cultivate its self-styled “punk” image, which proved popular with drinkers who embraced the UK’s “craft beer revolution” and rejected mainstream corporate brands. But over time Brewdog has grown to become the seventh largest brewer in Britain by sales, according to figures from consumer behaviour company Circana, which tracks retail sales. The brewer’s flagship Punk IPA has become one of Britain’s most popular beers, while the company has rolled out a network of more than 120 bars across the UK and overseas. Its aggressive expansion, partly funded by an army of “equity punk” crowdfunders, has delivered a tenfold increase in revenues in less than a decade, from £30m in 2014 to £321m in 2022. As BrewDog grew, Watt struggled to cling on to the image of cheeky challenger, amid investment from private equity group TSG, rumoured plans for a stock market float and a string of controversies. In 2021, Watt was accused by former workers in an open letter of presiding over a “culture of fear” within the business, with “toxic attitudes” towards junior staff. He apologised to staff and has said the group made changes after the open letter was published. In December 2022, the group lost its B Corp status, awarded to companies that follow ethical principles. In January, the company faced a backlash after revealing it would no longer hire new staff on the “real” living wage and would instead pay the lower legal minimum wage. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) named Watt its worst employer of the month in response to the pay row. On Wednesday, TUC’s general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: “My message to the new chief executive is simple – pay your staff the real living wage.” Brewdog’s chair, City of London veteran Allan Leighton, said: “Few have accomplished what [Watt] has. “From very humble beginnings under his leadership, BrewDog has grown to become the world’s leading craft brewer, employing 2,530 people across its head office, four breweries and over 120 bars.” Watt said he would use his newfound freedom to travel, spend time with family and loved ones, “nurture fantastic start-ups” and would, in due course, launch a new venture of his own. His investments include Yum Bug, an edible bug business. Arrow, who was hired as chief operating officer last September as part of BrewDog’s succession planning, was previously managing director of Boots Opticians. He is expected to focus on profitability, after the company reported losses of £30.5m last year, despite soaring sales.",

        "title": "AstraZeneca withdraws Covid-19 vaccine worldwide, citing surplus of newer vaccines",
        "content": "AstraZeneca has begun the worldwide withdrawal of its Covid-19 vaccine due to a “surplus of available updated vaccines” that target new variants of the virus. The announcement follows the pharmaceutical company in March voluntarily withdrawing its European Union marketing authorisation, which is the approval to market a medicine in member states. On 7 May, the European Medicines Agency issued a notice that the vaccine is no longer authorised for use. In a statement, AstraZeneca said the decision was made because there is now a variety of newer vaccines available that have been adapted to target Covid-19 variants. This had led to a decline in demand for the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is no longer being manufactured or supplied. “According to independent estimates, over 6.5 million lives were saved in the first year of use alone and over 3bn doses were supplied globally,” the statement said. “Our efforts have been recognised by governments around the world and are widely regarded as being a critical component of ending the global pandemic. We will now work with regulators and our partners to align on a clear path forward to conclude this chapter and significant contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic.” Other countries have already stopped supplying the vaccine. It has not been available for use in Australia since March 2023, though its use was already being phased out from June 2021 due to the widespread availability of newer vaccines. AstraZeneca changed the name of its Covid vaccine to Vaxzevria in 2021. The vaccine was authorised for use in those aged 18 and older, delivered as two injections, usually into the muscle of the upper arm, about three month apart. It was also used by some countries as a booster shot. Vaxzevria is made up of another virus of the adenovirus family modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The vaccine does not contain the virus itself and cannot cause the virus. Although the vaccine was found to be safe and effective overall, it carried the risk of a rare but serious side-effect, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The rare syndrome occurred in about two to three people per 100,000 who were vaccinated with the Vaxzevria vaccine. The chair of epidemiology at Deakin University in Australia, Prof Catherine Bennett, said the vaccine had played a pivotal part in the worldwide fight against the virus, particularly in the early days of the pandemic when limited vaccines were available. “It has saved millions of lives and that should not be forgotten,” she said. “It was a really important part of the initial global response. However, it targeted the initial ancestral variants. We’ve now moved into a vaccine chain where we have products available that are chasing the variants that are emerging. “There’s also a shift in the risk calculus as well, given populations are much more protected and, even though of course Covid still causes deaths, we are overall less vulnerable to the disease.” The latest Covid-19 vaccine advice issued by the World Health Organisation in April advised that formulations of Covid-19 vaccines should target the JN.1 lineage of the virus, which is displacing existing XBB lineage variants.",

        "content": "Unfair banking practices and “damaging” financial regulators are harming small businesses and putting innovation and growth at risk, parliament’s Treasury committee has warned. A report from the committee’s inquiry into access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) said a lack of supportive policies were compounding problems for firms that had survived a “torrid” five years, which included the global pandemic and energy crisis. “Confidence amongst SMEs in accessing finance has fallen and acceptance rates for business credit has lowered significantly,” the report said. “Unfair banking practices … may have further limited access and suppressed demand. This difficult small business environment is disincentivising risk-taking, innovation and, potentially, growth,” it warned. MPs said a number of practices were harming firms, including the use of personal guarantees – where borrowers often have to put up their home as collateral against a loan. The committee’s report also highlighted a growing concern about so-called “debanking” – when customers’ accounts are closed by their bank – noting that lenders had shut 140,000 SME accounts in 2023 alone, often without adequate explanation. It said closures often hit specific sectors deemed less desirable by banks, including those dealing in defence, pawnbroking and amusement machines. When it came to disagreements, MPs said there was a “substandard processes” for resolving disputes between SMEs and their banks. For example, they found that the Financial Ombudsman Service did not have the necessary resources and expertise to handle some of the more complex SME cases, while the Business Banking Resolution Service (BBRS) was deemed “ineffective” and “should close as planned”. The BBRS was set up with commercial banks in 2021 and is funded by them. It has been criticised for lacking independence and having “poorly formed eligibility criteria”, the report said. It has only settled 58 cases since being launched, but has cost more than £40m to operate. The committee’s chair, Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin, said: “There’s no hiding from the fact smaller firms have had a torrid time over the last few years. “Unfortunately, what we have found over the course of the inquiry is that there are some instances where banks and regulators are making a tough world for small businesses needlessly tougher. “Banks and regulators can’t wave a magic wand and solve all of the problems facing small businesses in this country, but they can certainly do more than they currently are. I hope banks, the regulators and the Treasury take careful note of what we’ve uncovered.” The committee has put forward a number of recommendations, including that the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), force banks to be more transparent about their decisions to close accounts and to share quarterly data on their closure decisions. The MPs also suggested that the FCA should tighten rules around misuse of personal guarantees and widen the remit of the Financial Ombudsman Service so that it could appropriately address related business complaints. The Federation of Small Businesses submitted a “super-complaint” to the FCA over the allegedly unfair use of personal guarantees by lenders late last year. The lobby group has called on the government to extend the FCA’s responsibilities so that all lending below a certain amount is subject to regulation, and that specific rules be introduced that appropriately balance the interests of borrowers and lenders. Small business lending is not regulated in the UK, and firms do not enjoy the same protection as personal borrowers and consumers. MPs on the committee also called on the Treasury to rapidly replace the BBRS with a new, independent system that can serve small businesses that fall outside the Financial Ombudsman’s responsibilities. An FCA spokesperson said: “We are already considering how the lending we do regulate is affected by personal guarantees and have been clear to banks they must be fair to people, including businesses, when considering closing accounts.” A spokesperson for UK Finance, the banking lobby group, said: “While a small proportion of business accounts are closed, the main reasons are financial crime concerns, being unable to complete customer due diligence or an account being dormant. This is also what the FCA found when they looked at the issue last year.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “SMEs play a vital role in fuelling economic growth which is why at the budget we extended the Growth Guarantee Scheme, which provides a 70% guarantee on finance up to £2m for small businesses to help them grow. “And we have already taken action on debanking – forcing banks to explain and delay any decision to close an account under new rules – and remain committed to legislation.”",

        "title": "Panera to pull caffeinated beverages connected to at least two deaths",
        "content": "Panera Bread will pull its infamous Charged Lemonade drinks after the highly caffeinated beverages were connected to at least two deaths and prompted lawsuits. The Charged Lemonades, which contain upwards of 178mg of caffeine for the regular size and 302mg for the large, are being eliminated by the restaurant chain amid a “recent menu transformation”, a Panera spokesperson told NBC News. “We listened to more than 30,000 guests about what they wanted from Panera, and are focusing next on the broad array of beverages we know our guests desire – ranging from exciting, on-trend flavors, to low-sugar and low-caffeine options,” the spokesperson said. The beverages were at the center of major lawsuits following the deaths of two people who died after drinking a Charged Lemonade drink. The family of 21-year-old Sarah Katz sued Panera after Katz, who had a heart condition, died after consuming a Charged Lemonade. The complaint, filed in the Philadelphia court of common pleas in October, stated that Katz had been unaware how much caffeine the beverage contained. In December, a second lawsuit was filed by the family of Dennis Brown, a 46-year-old man from Florida who died after consuming three Charged Lemonades, NBC News reported. Brown, who had underlying heath conditions, died after suffering a cardiac arrest. Panera was hit with a third lawsuit in January by a 28-year-old woman in Rhode Island who suffered cardiac injuries after drinking two-and-a-half Charged Lemonades in one day, CNN reported. Amid the lawsuits, Panera posted a health advisory for the Charged Lemonade drinks, warning that the beverages contained caffeine and were not recommended for children, pregnant or nursing people and those who are sensitive to caffeine. But family members of those who died have criticized the labels as not going far enough. Elizabeth Crawford, an attorney for the Katz family, previously told NBC that the added warnings for Charged Lemonades were “baby steps” and that the product was not labeled as an energy drink. A regular cup of coffee contains about 100mg of caffeine. “It’s misleading in the sense that it’s not indicating that it is an energy drink,” Crawford said to NBC. “I’m happy that we are moving in a direction of making a change, but I consider these baby steps.”",

        "title": "BP right to hold steady on climate targets despite below forecast profits | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "The market’s guessing game at BP is waiting for Murray Auchincloss, the chief executive who has been in post permanently only since January, to blink. That is to say, waiting for him to tone down climate targets and decide to pump more oil and gas than planned. Tuesday was not the day. BP’s first-quarter numbers were slightly weaker than the market had expected – profits of $2.7bn versus City forecasts of $2.9bn – but there wasn’t a twitch on the strategic tiller. Auchincloss trotted out his refrain about going from “IOC to IEC” – from international oil company to integrated energy company. The only fresh news was the promise of $2bn of cost savings over the next couple of years, but that’s the sort of thing energy firms announce routinely. Naturally, none of this did anything for a share price that is rated at a discount to London’s other oil major, Shell, a company itself grumbling about its own discount to American rivals Chevron and Exxon. BP, in other words, is rated towards the bottom end of the Big Oil pack. It is why its ambition to throw more capital, relatively speaking, at non-fossil fuel projects, such as biofuels, renewables and electric charging points, has come under such scrutiny. BP’s transition strategy doesn’t meet everybody’s definition of swift – it imagines oil and gas production at 2m barrels a day by 2030, a 25% reduction versus 2019 levels – but the point is that it is more ambitious than most major rivals. That is why one vocal lobby would like to see less ambition and more oil and gas for longer. Auchincloss, it should be noted, has given himself room to wriggle. He has billed himself as a pragmatist and his latest talk about “high grading” development projects to prefer those with higher returns could, in theory, morph into a slightly heavier tilt towards oil and gas without being deemed an outright U-turn. The 2030 production projection, remember, is an “aim” rather than a “target”. Yet one hopes Auchincloss doesn’t blink and sticks to something like the current script. BP’s claim is that it can generate 15% returns from biofuels and electric charging, which is roughly what oil and gas produces over the cycle. Renewables – meaning wind and solar primarily – is more of a struggle these days, but even there BP still reckons double-digit returns are achievable if the assets are plugged into other parts of its business, including, critically, the energy trading division. The hardest part is injecting credibility into such figures. The “transition growth engines”, as BP calls them, won’t be big enough to move the overall earnings needle until the end of the decade, which puts the pitch to investors in the complicated “trust us” category. For the time being, though, there’s no substantive reason to change course, whatever the share price says. First, aside from a misadventure with wind projects in the US, BP hasn’t obviously messed up yet. Second, $14bn of share buy-backs over two years, equivalent to 14% of the current market capitalisation, provides some level of floor. Third, the currently unfashionable notion of investing a few quid outside oil and gas in the interests of greater balance in earnings may look a smarter bet come 2030. Strategic fiddles, not revolution, are needed here.",

        "title": "LockBit ransomware group’s leader unmasked and hit with sanctions; UK house prices inch higher– business live",
        "content": "The alleged leader of what was once the world’s largest ransomware outfit, LockBit, has been named as Russian national Dmitry Khoroshev by the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), after the seizure of the criminal gang’s infrastructure. Khoroshev, who lived his online life under the name LockBitSupp, has been sanctioned by the UK, US and Australia as a result of the unmasking. He was so certain of his anonymity that he once offered a $10m (£8m) reward to anyone who could reveal his identity. The US government is now offering a reward of up to $10m for anyone who can share information leading to his arrest or conviction. LockBit was seen as one of the world’s most dangerous ransomware groups and its high-profile victims included delivery firm Royal Mail and aerospace company Boeing. More here: Time to recap….. The UK, US and Australia have sanctioned the Russian leader of one of the world’s most prolific ransomware groups, LockBit. As part of an ongoing international law enforcement investigation, Russian national Dmitry Khoroshev has been identified as one of the leaders of the group, which the Government says has been responsible for extorting more than one billion dollars from victims globally. As part of the sanctions, the Foreign Office said he would now be subject to a series of asset freezes and travel bans. The UK’s sanctions minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan says: “In sanctioning one of the leaders of LockBit we are taking direct action against those who continue to threaten global security, while simultaneously exposing the malicious cyber-criminal activity emanating from Russia.” The US Justice Department has unsealed a 26-count indictment against Khoroshev returned by a grand jury in the District of New Jersey. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco explains: “Working with U.S. and international partners, we are using all our tools to hold ransomware actors accountable—and we continue to encourage victims to report cyberattacks to the FBI when they happen. Reporting an attack could make all the difference in preventing the next one.” Here’s the rest of today’s business news stories: LockBit was particularly disruptive because it was designed as “ransomware-as-a-service” (RaaS) – meaning cybercriminals could buy the package and operate it themselves. The DoJ alleges that Khoroshev — as the LockBit developer — would typically receive a 20% share of each ransom payment extorted from LockBit victims, with whoever conducted the hack getting the remaining 80%. Today’s indictment says Khoroshev and his co-conspirators extracted at least $500m in ransom payments from their victims, meaning he received at least $100m in digital currency. FBI director Christopher Wray says that the LockBit ransomware group are responsible for billions of dollars in losses and caused havoc on critical infrastructure, including schools and hospitals. Wray adds: “The charges announced today reflect the FBI’s unyielding commitment to disrupting ransomware organizations and holding the perpetrators accountable.” The UK’s NCA says today that the group targeted over 100 hospitals and healthcare companies and at least 2,110 victims were forced into in some degree of negotiation by cyber criminals. The DoJ has charged Dmitry Khoroshev with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, extortion, and related activity in connection with computers; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; eight counts of intentional damage to a protected computer; eight counts of extortion in relation to confidential information from a protected computer; and eight counts of extortion in relation to damage to a protected computer. In total, those charges carry a maximum penalty of 185 years in prison. Each of the 26 counts charged by the indictment also carries a maximum fine of the greatest of $250,000, pecuniary gain to the offender, or pecuniary harm to the victim. Dmitry Khoroshev will now be subject to a series of asset freezes and travel bans, the UK’s National Crime Agency says. The UK’s sanctions minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan says: “Together with our allies we will continue to crack down on hostile cyber activity which is destroying livelihoods and businesses across the world. “In sanctioning one of the leaders of LockBit we are taking direct action against those who continue to threaten global security, while simultaneously exposing the malicious cyber-criminal activity emanating from Russia.” Britain’s National Crime Agency says it, and its international partners, now possess more than 2,500 decryption keys which could be used to unlock data encrypted by Lockbit. The NCA has so far proactively reached out to nearly 240 LockBit victims in the UK, it says. NCA director general Graeme Biggar says today: “These sanctions are hugely significant and show that there is no hiding place for cyber criminals like Dmitry Khoroshev, who wreak havoc across the globe. He was certain he could remain anonymous, but he was wrong. The US Department of Justice has unsealed a raft of charges against Dimitry Yuryevich Khoroshev over his alleged roles as the creator, developer, and administrator of the LockBit ransomware group. Fresh from being sanctioned by the US, UK and Australia today, Khoroshev has also been charged by a 26-count indictment returned by a grand jury in the District of New Jersey. Attorney General Merrick Garland explains that the charges follow the international disruption campaign targeting LockBit carried out earlier this year: “Earlier this year, the Justice Department and our U.K. law enforcement partners disrupted LockBit, a ransomware group responsible for attacks on victims across the United States and around the world. “Today we are going a step further, charging the individual who we allege developed and administered this malicious cyber scheme, which has targeted over 2,000 victims and stolen more than $100 million in ransomware payments. We will continue to work closely alongside our partners, across the U.S. government and around the world to disrupt cybercrime operations like LockBit and to find and hold accountable those responsible for them.” Just in: The US, UK and Australian governments say they have sanctioned the leader of the LockBit ransomware group, whose recent victims include Royal Mail. The US Treasury say it is exposing that that the cybercriminal responsible for the Lockbit ransomware variant is Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, a Russian national. Lockbit has conducted a swath of hacks, using phishing attacks to tricks computer users into downloading malware onto their computers. The infected computer is then compromised and encrypted, with Lockbit demanding money from the victim to release their data. Khoroshev, the US Treasury alleges, is the primary operator of the well-known and public-facing LockBit-related cybercrime moniker, “LockBitSupp.” In a statement, the Treasury explains: As a core LockBit group leader and developer of the LockBit ransomware, Khoroshev has performed a variety of operational and administrative roles for the cybercrime group, and has benefited financially from the LockBit ransomware attacks. In addition, Khoroshev has facilitated the upgrading of the LockBit infrastructure, recruited new developers for the ransomware, and managed LockBit affiliates. He is also responsible for LockBit’s efforts to continue operations after their disruption by the U.S. and its allies earlier this year. The US Department of State has also announced a reward of up to $10m for information that leads to the identification or location of any senior individual in the LockBit group. Khoroshev has also been added to the UK’s sanctions list, and faces a series of asset freezes and travel bans. The UK government’s list of sanctioned individuals says: Dmitry Yureyvich KHOROSHEV is or has been involved in relevant cyber activity in that he has been responsible for, engaged in, provided support for or promoted the commission, planning or preparation of relevant cyber activity, or provided technical assistance that could contribute to relevant cyber activity. Lockbit’s operations were severely disrupted by a coordinated international crackdown earlier this year. Today, the UK’s National Crime Agency reports that between June 2022 and February 2024, more than 7,000 attacks were built using Lockbit’s services. The top five countries hit were the US, UK, France, Germany and China. Good news for holidaymakers looking to fly overseas this summer – ticket fares will rise less than expected. That’s according to budget airline Ryanair’s CEO, Michael O’Leary, who has predicted that ticket fare prices this summer are likely going to be lower than previously expected, Speaking to reporters in Brussels today, O’Leary says: “Looking at summer ... We thought pricing would be up 5-10%. We’re heading to flat (pricing year-on-year) to 5% up, which is surprising with a lot of the Airbus  fleet grounded for maintenance.” This appears to have knocked shares in airlines. EasyJet’s shares are now down 5% in London, with British Airways parent company IAG down 1.5% and Wizz Air off 3%. Ryanair’s shares are down 4%. Airlines have been pushing up prices since the end of pandemic restrictions, as they try to recoup their losses during Covid-19 and take advantage of customers keen to travel again. In April, one industry consultant said he was seeing “quite stunning levels of pricing” in the market, as passengers stumped up higher air fares. Advances in artificial intelligence risk destabilising the financial markets, a Bank of England policymaker is warning today. Jonathan Hall, an external member of our Financial Policy Committee (FPC), argues that market stability could be threatened if deep neural networks – programs that uses multiple layers of artificial neurons to process information – were turned into deep trading agents, which select and execute trading strategies. Hall tells the University of Exeter Business School that AI traders could amplify shocks and undermine market stability. He says there are two risks: [First] That deep trading agents, whilst increasing efficiency in good times, could lead to an increasingly brittle and highly correlated financial market. [Second] That the incentives of deep trading agents could become misaligned with that of regulators and the public good. Hall cites a well-known example of AI confusion, where researches taught a system what a panda looked like, and then added noise to the picture of a panda – leading the AI system to declare that the animal was almost certainly a gibbon. Hall say: From a financial stability perspective, this raises the question of whether through bad luck, or targeted malicious behaviour, a tiny change in market prices could abruptly shift the trading signal from “buy” to “strong sell”? And, unlike in the image example, it would be extremely difficult for a human to know whether that sudden shift was the result of a model error, or indicated some important, but inscrutable, information in the pattern of prices. Hall then cites the idea that an AI system could be trained on all historic price changes and all readable historic data relevant to fundamental financial analysis. Such an algorithm would have risk, and profit and loss, rules built in, and over time would outcompete human traders. If that happened, capital would shift towards this high-performing AI system. But if it was unable to absorb shocks, this ecosystem that is unsustainable. Hall says there are two general concerns about such a trading algorithm based on analysing the fair value of stocks – either it shows exhibit volatile, unpredictable behaviour because it was not trained well, or it fails because it can’t adjust to a change in market environment. But there’s another danger too – what about an AI system that analyse order book data to predict the imminent order flow of other traders? Studies have shown that such “informed AI speculators” will behave in a cooperative, way until triggered to do otherwise, leading to lower price informativeness and lower market liquidity. And worse – the AI system might learn that it can make the best profits during times of market instability, so decide to amplify any external shock that hits the markets…. Hall argues that City firms must ensure that any AI systems they develop are aligned with regulations. He says: Any deep trading algorithms must be trained in a way that ensures that their behaviour is consistent the regulatory rule book. This is a dynamic process in two respects: Training must be updated to respond to any discovered divergence between regulatory intent and reaction function; and trading managers must keep reinforcing the rules to make sure they are not forgotten The Eurozone construction sector struggled in April, with activity falling. Building firms across the euro area reported that new orders fell sharply last month, leading to a further reduction in construction activity, and cutbacks on employment levels and purchasing activity. That’s according to S&amp;P Global’s survey of purchasing managers at eurozone construction firms, which has slumped to just 41.9 in April from 42.4 in March. That shows a hefty fall in activity, further from the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. Construction activity fell again in Germany and France, while in Italy it decreased for the first time in seven months. The Eurozone’s construction sector appears to be even further from recovery than in March, warns Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, adding: Civil engineering activity is in a bad state, commercial activity is worse and housing activity looks bleak. While the performance of housing and civil engineering is similarly as bad than in previous months, the crisis in commercial building activity, including offices, has deepened. With the marginal softening of the fall in new orders, any expectation of a near-term recovery seems unfounded. The development in the Eurozone’s construction sector, which has been rather varied in recent months, is now converging among Germany, France and Italy. However, this convergence is not cause for celebration, as Italy has simply joined the club of countries with a shrinking construction sector. Until recently, Italy had shown surprising resilience linked to the so-called superbonus program and recovery and resilience plan. Both seem to have lost force over the last months, in part because they are running out. “The most forward-looking indicator of new orders in April is almost as dire as it has been over the past five months. New orders are plummeting rapidly, with Germany leading the downward trend, followed by France and Italy. This trend does not augur well for the near future, indicating that the construction sector’s recession will persist in Germany and France, while beginning to take hold in Italy. Entertainment giant Disney has hit a landmark today – its streaming business has turned a profit for the first time since the launch of Disney+ more than four years ago. Disney has report that its “Direct-to-Consumer” division made a profit of $47m in the first quarter of this year, up from a $587m loss in Q1 2023. It also added more than six million Disney+ subscribers in the quarter, taking the total worldwide to 117.6m But, Disney’s shares have dropped by more than 5% in pre-market trading. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says the results have fallen short of high expectations: Revenues were $22.08bn, down a touch from the $22.1bn expected. Operating income was 17% higher than a year ago at $3.85bn, vs. $3.51bn expected. Hulu reported higher than expected subscriber figures, however, Disney + subscriber growth did not meet expectations, the total number of subscribers is now 153.6mn, analysts were expecting 155.66mn. In the cut-throat world of streaming, subscribers mean everything, and if you fall short on this metric, then it can put off investors, which may be the case on Tuesday. Bob Iger may have won the boardroom battle with Nelson Peltz, but not even higher future guidance for earnings -per – share was enough to stop the market selling Disney on the back of these results. UK government bonds have been rising in price today, as City investors await hints from the Bank of England as to when interest rates may start to fall. This has pushed down the yield, or rate of return, on short and long-term UK bonds. The yield on two-year UK gilts has dropped by 7 basis points, to 4.31% from 4.38% at the end of last week. That’s the lowest since mid-April. Ten-year gilt yields also hit a three-week low, at 4.61%. Thirty-year debt (which matures in 2054) has also strengthened, which has pushed down its yield by 10 basis points (0.1 percentage point) to 4.618% from 4.71%. Mechanistically, bond yields fall when the price paid by investors rises. Falling bond yields can be a sign that the City is anticipating that central banks will cut interest rates soon – as investors would accept a lower rate of return for holding onto government bonds. The BoE isn’t expected to cut interest rates on Thursday, but it could offer hints as to how soon it might lower borrowing costs. Back in the housing market, estate agent Savills predicts today that UK house prices are expected to rise by more than £60,000 over the next five years. Prices will pick up as Britain’s mortgage crunch eases, Savills argues. More here: Some good news – household incomes across advanced economies picked up at the end of last year. New data today shows that real household income per capita in the OECD rose by 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023, following a 0.2% fall in the third quarter. Among G7 members, real household income per capita grew fastest in France (by 0.7%), follwed by the UK with a 0.5% rise. This real income growth was driven mainly by increased social benefits, the OECD says. That’s despite the UK falling into recession at the end of last year, with GDP per capita (a measure of living standards) dropping by 0.6% in Quarter 4 2023. UK GDP per capita has not grown since the first quarter of 2022, leaving Britain in a long living standards recession. Looking back at today’s UK construction PMI, the survey shows that building firms are hoping that the Bank of England will lower interest rates later this year. S&amp;P Global’s economic director Tim Moore says: “Business activity expectations for the year ahead picked up slightly in April, supported by a sustained recovery in new orders, positive signals for sales pipelines, and anticipated interest rate cuts in the second half of 2024.” The interest rate probabilities market has been volatile this year. Today, it shows that the money markets are anticipating two quarter-point cuts to Bank rate this year, bringing it down from 5.25% to 4.75% by the end of 2024. The first cut is fully priced in for August, with the second likely in November, or possibly December. The Bank of England has an attack of the gremlins this morning. The UK central bank has said today it is postponing an indexed long-term repo operation due to technical problems with the platform markets use to place bids for funds, Reuters reports. In a message to markets, the BoE said: “A further screen announcement will be made as soon as possible.” Repo auctions allows commercial banks to borrow cash from the Bank of England, in return for providing other, less liquid assets as collateral. They’re part of the plumbing of the financial system. The ongoing slump in UK housebuilding, reported in today’s construction PMI report, is a blow to people looking to get onto the housing ladder, or simply to escape homelessness. Britain’s large construction firms cut their housebuilding work last year, as the rise in mortgage costs made it harder for buyers to afford new homes. Last December, the government relaxed the housing targets for local authorities in England, which critics warned would lead to less property development. Last summer, the number of households in temporary accommodation in England hit a record high of 105,750, and in February, housing associations warned that the number of affordable homes being built in London had plummeted by three-quarters in the last 12 months. Just in: UK construction sector growth has hit a 14-month high, despite a drop in housebuilding. Data firm S&amp;P Global reports that the UK construction sector gained momentum last month, due to solid rates of expansion in the commercial and civil engineering segments. This pushed the S&amp;P Global UK Construction Purchasing Managers’ Index, which measures activity, up to 53.0 in April, from 50.2 in March. That’s the highest reading since February 2023, further from the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. But, the survey also shows a “setback” for house building activity, where the sub-index dropped to 47.6. The data suggests “a moderate fall in residential building work”, with builders blaming sluggish market conditions and higher borrowing costs. Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says: Lacklustre market conditions in the house building segment continued to weigh on activity. The latest survey pointed to the fastest reduction in residential building work since January, although the speed of the downturn remained much softer than in the second half of 2023. Hiring trends were subdued in April despite a recovery in workloads, which mirrored trends seen in other part of the UK economy, as construction firms sought to maintain a tight focus on costs against a backdrop of strong wage pressures. Purchasing prices nonetheless increased only modestly in April. Car sales to UK private buyers fell in April, as demand for vehicles weakened and sales of electric cars to consumers fell. Industry body SMMT has reported that overall UK new car registrations grew for the 21st consecutive month in April, rising by 1.0% to 134,274 units. But, that growth was entirely due to sales to fleet operators (such as car rental firms). While fleet registrations jumped by 18.5%, there was a 17.7% drop in sales to private buyers and a 16.1% drop in registrations to businesses The SMMT reports that electrified vehicles were the main drivers of market expansion again. Sales of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) rose by 22.1% year-on-year, followed by hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) which gres by 16.7%. Sales of battery-powered electric vehicle (BEVs) rose by 10.7%. But, the increased sales of BEVs was entirely due to business buyers, with sales to consumers falling by almost 22%. The SMMT says: While the overall increase in BEV demand is positive, urgent action is needed to re-enthuse private buyers into switching…. Drivers today enjoy the widest ever choice of BEV models – more than 100 – powered by the latest technology, and manufacturers continue to provide compelling offers to encourage their uptake. However, the lack of government incentives for private motorists remains a barrier that cannot be overcome by industry alone. The small increase in UK house prices in April has left them broadly flat since the turn of the year, says Peter Arnold, EY UK chief economist: The stabilisation in market conditions reflects the large fall in mortgage rates since last summer, with transactions and prices appearing to have passed their trough. However, the recent rise in mortgage rates is likely to dampen the recovery in the short-term. And looking ahead, the recovery in prices is unlikely to be rapid given that poor affordability continues to significantly limit the pool of potential buyers and mortgage rates are only likely to fall back slowly. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank says higher mortgage rates are continuing to hit market momentum, adding: As the prospect of the first rate cut since March 2020 drifts further into the distance, borrowing costs have edged higher and budgets have been squeezed. A short-lived burst of positivity in the early weeks of this year led to higher supply, increasing downwards pressure on prices. A wave of homeowners currently rolling off sub-2% mortgages is adding to the financial pressures in the system. As a summer rate cut moves onto the horizon, we expect UK house prices to respond and rise by 3% in 2024.” The recent increases in mortgage rates could lead to market volatility this year, warns Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients: “Borrowers have benefited from cheaper mortgage rates since the start of the year, which has boosted market activity and enquiries. “Since then, higher funding costs have led to higher mortgage rates over the past couple of weeks and there is likely to be some volatility in pricing ahead. Borrowers would be wise to secure a rate they like the look of to protect themselves from further price fluctuations in the short term. “Once the Bank of England is confident inflationary pressures have eased and starts cutting interest rates, this will provide a welcome boost for the market and should help increase confidence and activity.” Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent group Fine &amp; Country, suggests a cut in interesst ratesr would help the market: “House prices are yo-yoing as buyers and sellers negotiate their way through the uncertain economy, with a small monthly rise in April. “Consumers are expecting a fall in interest rates at some point this year. But with lenders increasing rates in the last few weeks, buyers have understandable hesitancy over the right price to offer, while sellers are trying to navigate how offers align with their expectations. “Yet despite this confusion over pricing, demand is holding up well, with mortgage approvals continuing to rise and supply levels improving. “All attention turns to the Bank of England, as a fall in the base rate this week would help to solidify confidence in the housing market.” However, the City don’t expect the BoE to cut rates at its meeting on Thursday – the first cut is currently fully priced in for August. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: It looks like mortgage rates will continue to remain elevated with the Bank of England poised to keep interest rates at 16-year highs of 5.25% this Thursday. Financial markets have been pushing back their forecasts for the timing of the first rate hike this year, with August currently pencilled into the diary, although that could certainly change depending on the data.” Over in Germany, manufacturing orders have dropped unexpectedly…. but exports are improving. New data shows that German factory orders dropped by 0.4% in March, missing forecasts for a rise of 0.4%. Orders for new cars rose by 1.1%, but orders for ”other transport equipment” such as aircraft, ships, and trains fell by 2.3% month on month. Orders for fabricated metal products fell by 4.5%, but electrical equipment orders were up 5.9%. But, statistics body Destatis have also reported that German exports picked up by 0.9% in March, rising faster than imports (which were up 0.3%). This “confirms the return of the export-driven German growth model’, says Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, who is also concerned that industrial orders remain weak. Brzeski writes: The share of exports to the US increased to more than 10% of total exports in 2023, while the share of exports to China dropped to 6%, significantly below pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, Germany exported more to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary than to the US. However, banking on a return of the well-known success formula of the export-oriented growth model would be deceptive. The long list of geopolitical risks, potential trade tensions and increasing global competition should provide sufficient arguments against policy complacency. The German economic business model still needs to be much more balanced. To some extent, industrial orders this morning illustrated the high risk that the revival of the export-oriented success formula is only short-lived. In fact, after the first post-lockdown recovery, demand for German manufacturing goods has been weak. In fact, since the start of 2022, industrial orders have dropped on average by 0.5% every month. Commuters who are forced to work from home today due to the rail strikes can take comfort that at least the weather has improved, after some damp and chilly weeks (months?). That cold, wet weather has been bad news for retailers and restaurants this spring, the latest industry figures show. Sales were virtually flat across March and April against the same period a year ago, according to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body and advisory firm KPMG. That was despite prices continuing to rise with inflation, suggesting a drop in the volume of items sold in the key Easter period. More here. Boom! Britain’s FTSE 100 share index has hit a fresh alltime high at the start of trading in London. The Footsie has extended its recent rally, jumping by over 1.1% to hit 8311 points, a new intraday high. Traders are hitting their buy buttons as they return to their desks after the Bank Holiday break, catching up with a rally on Wall Street last night…. …. those traders who managed to reach their desks, anyway, given trains on some of the busiest commuter routes in the country are not running today, due to strike action. Saudi Arabia’s energy giant Aramco has just released its latest financial results, and like BP they show a drop in earnings in the last quarter. Here’s the details: Net income: $27.3bn (Q1 2023: $31.9bn) Cash flow from operating activities: $33.6bn (Q1 2023: $39.6bn) Free cash flow: $22.8bn (Q1 2023: $30.9bn) Income before income taxes and zakat fell to $54.67bn in the quarter, down from $61.12bn in the first three months of 2023. Saudi Aramco says: The decrease was primarily a result of lower crude oil volumes sold, weakening refining and chemicals margins, and lower finance and other income. This was partially offset by lower production royalties and an increase in crude oil prices compared to the same period last year. Campaign group Global Witness have calculated that BP shareholders have received “a staggering £22.3bn” since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Those payments have come through dividends – which BP raised by 10% last year – and through share buybacks, in which BP uses case to buy back and cancel shares, a process which lifts its share prices. Alice Harrison, Head of Fossil Fuel Campaigns at Global Witness, says: “These past two years have inflicted untold misery and pain on the people of Ukraine, while big energy firms that spent years doing business with Putin’s Russia have seen the cash roll in.” It’s obscene that anyone would profit from the Ukraine war, the energy crisis, or the climate crisis, but that’s what’s happening. With the biggest spoils going to one of the richest, most destructive industries in the world - the fossil fuel industry.” “Instead of helping to rebuild Ukraine, ease the burden of high bills or support countries suffering from the climate crisis, BP is making the rich richer. And this will continue to be the case until we make the urgent switch to a clean energy system.” Halifax’s UK house price report shows that annual price falls are predominately found in the south of England, maintaining the ‘North-South’ divide across English regions. The North West of England continues to see the strongest growth in England, with average prices up by 3.3% on an annual basis to £231,599. Prices in London are pretty flat over the last year up just 0.1% (with the average at £539,336). Properties in Eastern England recorded the biggest decline of -1.1%, with homes selling for an average of £329,723, a drop of £3,541 over the last year. Northern Ireland remains the strongest performing nation or region in the UK, with house prices up by 3.4% over the last year (taking the average to £192,502)) In Wales annual property price growth slowed to +1.1% in April, while prices in Scotland are up 1.5% year-on-year. Despite average house prices inching up in April, Halifax adds that affordability constraints are still a significant challenge. That applies to new buyers, and also borrowers who are rolling off fixed-term deals, and facing a jump in repayment costs. Amanda Bryden, Halifax’s head of mortgages, says interest rate cuts later this year should help borrowers: Mortgage rates have edged up again in recent weeks, primarily as a result of expectations around future Bank of England base rate changes, with markets now pricing in a slower pace of cuts. If, as is still expected, downward moves in Bank Rate come into play later this year, fixed mortgage rates should fall. Combined with the resilience displayed by the housing market over recent months, we now expect property prices to rise modestly over the course of 2024.” In the oil sector, energy giant BP has missed profit forecasts this morning. BP has reported a drop in profits, with underlying earnings falling to $2.7bn in the first quarter of 2024, down from $2.9bn in the final quarter of 2024. That’s below analysts forecasts for profits of $2.9bn, and sharply lower than the $4.9bn BP made in Q1 2023, when oil and gas prices were higher. BP says the drop in profits was due to weaker oil and gas trading, “significantly weaker” profit margins at its fuels division, and the disruption at its Whiting refinery outage in northwest Indiana which shut down for several weeks due to a power outage. But despite this drop in profits, BP is continuing to pump money to shareholders. It has annouced a new $1.75bn share buyback this morning. Kate Thomson chief financial officer at BP, says: bp reported solid financial performance in the first quarter with adjusted EBITDA* of $10.3 billion and underlying replacement cost profit of $2.7 billion. Our financial frame is unchanged, and we are delivering competitive shareholder distributions, announcing a $1.75 billion share buyback for the first quarter as part of our commitment of $3.5 billion for the first half of 2024. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of busines, the financial markets and the world economy. Another day, another healthcheck on the UK housing sector. And this morning, lender Halifax have reported that the market is “finding its feet” in the face of higher borrowing costs. Halifax’s monthly gauge shows that average house price rose by +0.1% in April on a monthly basis, after a fall of 0.9% in March. On an annual basis, prices were 1.1% higher than in April 2023 – a time when house price growth was weaker. This has lifted the average price to £288,949, slightly higher than the £288,781 in March, with growth fastest in Northern Ireland. This contrasts with rival lender Nationwide, which reported last week that prices dipped by 0.4% in April. Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax, says the average house prices have “largely plateaued” in the early part of 2024, adding: “This reflects a housing market finding its feet in an era of higher interest rates. While borrowing costs remain more expensive than a few years ago, homebuyers are gaining confidence from a period of relative stability. Activity and demand is improving, evidenced by greater numbers of mortgage applications so far this year, while at an industry level mortgage approvals have reached their highest point in 18 months. Bryden adds that first-time buyers have been compensating for higher borrowing costs by targeting smaller properties. That has left to the prices of flats rising faster than larger properties in 2024.

        "title": "P&O Ferries boss asked if he is ‘modern-day pirate’ for paying staff £4.87 an hour",
        "content": "The boss of P&amp;O Ferries has been asked if he is “a pirate” who appears to be “robbing staff blind” – as he confirmed to MPs that the group’s seafarers had been receiving pay rates even lower than he had previously told parliament. Peter Hebblethwaite previously appeared in front of a joint transport and business committee in March 2022 to respond to P&amp;O Ferries sacking 786 staff and replacing them with low-paid agency workers. At the time he told parliamentarians that the lowest-paid agency worker would receive £5.15 an hour – only for a Guardian and ITV News investigation this March to reveal how some P&amp;O seafarers were receiving an hourly rate as low as £4.87. On Tuesday, in an appearance before the business and trade committee, which was prompted by the reports, the chair, Liam Byrne MP, opened by asking Hebblethwaite: “Are you basically a modern-day pirate? … You seem to be robbing your staff blind.” The ferry group’s chief executive said without the mass sackings “P&amp;O would not be here today” – before admitting “the lowest, fully consolidated hourly pay is about £4.87”. The Guardian and ITV News had asked P&amp;O specifically about a £4.87 an hour figure less than two months ago, when a P&amp;O spokesperson said: “We do not recognise the pay rates that you are referencing. No member of our crew on our Dover-Calais vessels earns less than $2,400 per month, equivalent to £5.20 per hour.” The UK minimum wage is £11.44 an hour – but the rates do not apply to maritime workers employed by an overseas agency who work on foreign-registered ships in international waters. As P&amp;O uses that model, the pay rates onboard its vessels are legal. Asked whether he could live on £4.87 an hour, Hebblethwaite replied: “No, I couldn’t.” In March, as part of its response to the 2022 dismissals, France signed a decree that would force cross-Channel operators to pay their workers the French minimum wage of at least €11.65 (£9.95) an hour. A similar UK law is expected to come into force this summer and P&amp;O told MPs it would abide by both sets of legislation. The Guardian and ITV’s reporting also highlighted how the low-cost crew – who had been hired via a Malta-based employment agency and came from countries including India, the Philippines and Malaysia – were understood to have been working for months on the ships without a day off. The workers said they had to remain onboard until their contract ended, with one describing the experience as like being in “jail”. Hebblethwaite appeared to dispute this and told the committee P&amp;O “contracted” cross-Channel ferry staff on the basis of seven days off a month. Byrne said: “Both ITV and the Guardian found people working 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, for up to 17 weeks at a time without a day off, and without permission to leave the ship. You’ve just told the committee that people have seven days off a month.” Hebblethwaite replied: “The maritime labour convention requires seafarers to have a minimum of two and a half days off per month. On Dover-Calais, we contract for seven days off.” Bryne said: “So the conclusions of this investigation, from ITV and Guardian, are wrong?” After a four-second silence, Byrne pressed: “Is that a yes?” Hebblethwaite said: “I can only tell you what we do.” After the select committee session, a series of P&amp;O seafarers contacted the Guardian and ITV News to reiterate that they did not receive seven days off a month. One said they had “never had seven days off per month across the Channel, you can trust us”. After the committee session closed, the Guardian and ITV News asked P&amp;O how many days off a month seafarers working on P&amp;O cross-Channel ferries typically received – and if the company had misled parliament. P&amp;O did not provide a response to either question but Hebblethwaite had told the committee “the terms under which the crew is employed is set by the crewing agent”. P&amp;O’s chief executive said he earned a £325,000 basic salary and received an £183,000 bonus in April 2023. “I reflected on accepting that payment. But ultimately I did decide to accept it,” he said. “I do recognise it is not a decision that everybody would have made.” He also told MPs: “We recognise that we made a very difficult decision two years ago – one that was legal and one that I wish we had never ever had to make in the first place. “But we also have to acknowledge that without that difficult decision P&amp;O would not be here today and we would not have been able to preserve the 2,000 jobs we have been able to preserve, take the 135,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions that we have taken out of our carbon footprint, open up new routes and continue to serve the most important trade route between the UK and the continent.” Hebblethwaite added that P&amp;O “didn’t sack anyone [in 2022]. We did initiate a redundancy programme” and that the welfare of crew onboard the company’s ships was “second to none”.",

        "title": "Sizewell C in Suffolk granted nuclear site licence",
        "content": "A planned nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk has been granted the first site licence in more than a decade as investors and government officials race to finalise a deal for the multibillion-pound project this year. The licence from the nuclear regulator is considered a milestone for EDF, which plans to build Sizewell C as a replica of its Hinkley Point C project in Somerset, which has been dogged by delays and cost overruns. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has granted only two site licences to build new nuclear plants in more than 35 years: the first for Hinkley Point C in 2012, and the second for Sizewell. It was granted as EDF works to reach a final investment decision on the Sizewell C project by the end of this year, depending on a government framework to finance the project and fresh investment to cover its construction costs. EDF holds just under 50% stake in the project, while the UK government holds just over 50%. They are searching for further investment after EDF’s partner at Hinkley Point, China’s CGN, was barred from the successor project over security concerns. Mina Golshan, a director at Sizewell C, said the licence was a “show of confidence” from the UK’s nuclear regulator that the company had a suitable site and was ready to begin large-scale construction work on a safe design replicated from Hinkley Point C. “It’s a huge milestone and demonstrates that this project is firmly on track,” Golshan said. EDF has blamed inflation, Covid and Brexit for a four-year delay and cost overruns at the Hinkley Point C site. It believes that by learning the lessons from Hinkley it will be able to build Sizewell C in about nine years. Mark Foy, the ONR chief nuclear inspector and its chief executive, said the licence was granted after “extensive engagement and review” by the ONR team and would allow the regulator to take greater regulatory oversight and challenge the company as it progressed its plans. “The licensing process is fundamental in confirming that operators of a nuclear site are ready and able to meet their obligations under the nuclear site licence, to protect their workforce and the public,” Foy said. A group campaigning against the nuclear plant, Stop Sizewell C, said it was “appalled that a nuclear site licence has been issued when matters critical to the future safety of the site remain unresolved. “There isn’t even a final design of the sea defences, which will be necessary to keep this vulnerable site safe for the next century and a half, at the very least. This seems to us like kicking the can down the road, on the assumption that some future generation will be able to clear up the mess,” the group said.",

        "title": "Worried carmakers call for urgent UK help to reignite waning interest in electric vehicles",
        "content": "Car manufacturers have called for urgent action to reignite the switch to electric vehicles, after sales figures showed slowing demand among ordinary motorists for battery-powered cars. While overall UK registrations grew by 1% in April year-on-year to 134,000, the increase was caused by fleet sales, with private buyer sales down by almost 18% on last year. Manufacturers are alarmed by slowing sales growth in battery electric vehicles, which in the first four months of 2024 have only increased market share by 0.3% from the same period in 2023, to 15.7%, despite the rapid take-up in previous years. While the industry expects the figure to improve this year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that BEV sales would be below government targets of 22% of all new cars, and called for steps to “re-enthuse” buyers, including tax cuts, incentives and more chargers. The SMMT said incentives had increased take-up of battery electric vehicles in the fleet market, and similar moves for private buyers would hasten the transition. It urged a halving of VAT on new battery-powered cars, and changing the threshold for taxing luxury cars. The additional “expensive car” levy paid in vehicle excise duty is due to apply to electric cars from April 2025, which are still significantly more expensive than petrol equivalents despite manufacturers’ pledges to reduce production costs. The industry body said more work was needed to install charge points nationwide to improve consumer confidence – the UK still has one standard charger for every 35 plug-in cars, despite record numbers of installations last year and at the start of 2024. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “The absence of government incentives for private buyers is having a marked effect. Although attractive deals on EVs are in place, manufacturers cannot fund the mass-market transition single-handedly. Temporarily cutting VAT, treating EVs as fiscally mainstream not luxury vehicles, and taking steps to instil consumer confidence in the charge point network will drive the market growth on which Britain’s net zero ambition depends.” The government introduced a mandate last September for 22% of carmakers’ sales in 2024 to be zero-emission vehicles, but also extended the deadline for a ban on the sale of new fossil fuel cars until 2035. A grant scheme for private buyers of EVs was ended in 2022. Car dealers echoed the SMMT concerns. Ian Plummer, commercial director of Auto Trader, said EVs were typically 35% dearer than traditionally fuelled petrol and diesel models, adding: “The discounts we’ve seen manufacturers offer to incentivise consumers into new electric cars seems to be working … That said, we’ll need to see even more price action to achieve mass electric adoption.” Lisa Watson, director of sales at Close Bros Motor Finance said: “Manufacturers may have cause for concern that the number of new petrol vehicles registered continues to outdo the sales of battery electric vehicle registrations, bringing into sharp focus the work the UK government needs to do to improve inadequate infrastructure such as charging points, and allay motorist concerns to encourage adoption.”",

        "title": "‘Labour will surpass your expectations’: the leftwing thinktank boss standing on Starmer’s agenda",
        "content": "Miatta Fahnbulleh has been talking about economic transformation for as long as she can remember. After she and her family fled civil war in Liberia as a child, the main topics of conversation around the breakfast table in London were politics and economics. “When other people were talking about EastEnders, we were on about changing the economic settlement,” says the 44-year-old former chief executive of the New Economics Foundation (NEF), who is standing as Labour’s candidate in Peckham, south London, at the next election. “They are the two things that shape my views about economics: the poverty levels I saw in Liberia, and talking about how we change the economic settlement at breakfast or dinner. Then you see first-generation immigrants trying to make it in this country, and it just doesn’t work. That’s what drives me.” A rising intellectual star in Labour’s ranks, Fahnbulleh is working overtime in the run-up to the election as a senior economic adviser to Angela Rayner and Ed Miliband, as well as juggling campaigning in her own patch, charity work, and school pick-ups for her 10-year-old and her five-year-old twins. “It’s a handful. But it’s also a privilege and keeps me grounded. If you have a bad day, you go home, and you’re just Mum, whatever you were doing.” Despite her prominent role running a leading left-of-centre thinktank – including regular appearances on the BBC’s Question Time – she has spent most of her career since joining the civil service under the last Labour government behind the scenes. Now she hopes to jump from talking about economic change to enacting it, in a switch that could put her on a path to the frontbench. Still, the self-identified “policy wonk” worries the task is easier said than done, warning that Labour is facing a “dire economic inheritance” from the Conservatives should Keir Starmer’s party win power, as the polls predict. “We’ve got a massive job on our hands. It’s going to take 10 or 15 years,” she says, taking time out of campaigning to chat in a cafe in her prospective constituency, where Labour has a majority of 34,000 – meaning that, even with boundary changes for the election, she will almost certainly succeed the retiring MP, Harriet Harman. “You only need to walk around Peckham to feel it. Not just to see it but to feel it. People are really ground down. “And for me, it’s not just the fact that the economy has pretty much flatlined for 15 years. It’s the fact that it’s just not working. It’s staggering that living standards have not budged in that time.” Fahnbulleh was born in September 1979 in Liberia, half a year before a violent coup. Her father, Boimah, was a politics professor before serving in the government of military leader Samuel Doe, first as minister for education, then of foreign affairs. However, he became a vocal critic as Doe transformed Africa’s first republic into a violently repressive dictatorship, and the family was forced to flee first to neighbouring Sierra Leone – the country of her mother’s birth, and where her grandfather was Liberia’s ambassador – before arriving in the UK to claim asylum. “He was at the top of the hitlist,” Fahnbulleh says of her father. “Because he was vocal, and he had a big leadership with the student movement, they saw him as a threat.” Sharing her name with her aunt, a prominent musician and activist (“who can sing, unlike me!”), Fahnbulleh says the opportunity to represent Peckham and its diverse population, including many from the west African diaspora, is a huge privilege. But while joining a growing number of black British female politicians, she remains one of very few such figures in economics. “I can count my other female black economists on one hand. It’s a bigger problem than in politics,” she says. “It’s not diverse enough. And why does that matter? If we like it or not, so much of the rules of the game, so much of our politics, is dominated by economics. “It is a very closed shop, with a very particular view of the world. And unless you diversify that … [it] only brings us one perspective.” Although she grew up in north-west London, and attended a fee-paying school in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, Peckham played a big role in Fahnbulleh’s youth, with visits most weekends with her mother to its Sierra Leonean shops and restaurants. “It’s the hub for the community. It’s my home from home. “I think when I leave politics, I want Peckham to feel very different for the community. Because if we’ve done that in Peckham, we will have changed the country. That’s my test.” Fixing the cost of living crisis will, however, be no mean feat as millions of households suffer the worst hit to living standards on record, according to figures that date back to 1956 – particularly as Labour faces criticism that its toned-down tax and spending plans differ little from the Conservatives’. “You get a lot of ‘Labour has no ideas,’” says Fahnbulleh, who in her work for Rayner and Miliband is tasked with both developing bold new ideas and making sure they can be implemented in government. “But part of the challenge is that every time Labour has pushed out an idea, it’s been nicked. So you can forgive the team for saying: ‘We’re trying to give a sense of what we’re about, and a flavour of some of our policies, but we’re not going to give you the full thing now.’” Labour, in her view, will be more progressive than its critics anticipate, through plans for a transformation of workers’ rights and the creation of a state-owned energy company. Still, she admits unease over the decision to slash the party’s high-profile £28bn green investment plan. “I think every single person in the Labour party is disappointed, because it was part of our programme,” she says. “But in the end, it’s not the world we want; it’s the world we’ve been given. If it was a different inheritance, we would still have that policy.” Compromise in the face of tough economic questions, while promising a transformation of the economy, is a recurring theme in Labour circles. Not least for Fahnbulleh, who as the boss of the NEF for six years until December 2023 ran an organisation that heavily influenced Jeremy Corbyn’s economic agenda. “I think we were completely right in our analysis of the problem,” she says, reflecting on the period. “We were putting up solutions – by the way, some of which the government itself nicked – that were right for the times.” However, Labour’s 2019 manifesto was too ambitious, she says. “People aren’t stupid. Yes, they can see all the problems. But they also know governments don’t turn things around like this overnight. It was a 15-year programme for government in a five-year prospectus that no one believed.” She says the big lesson she has learned is not to ditch your principles, but to pace yourself. “Of course we have to be ambitious, but we also have to give people a prospectus they can believe. You’re better off saying ‘10-year projects’, so you know what we’re about. “I think we will surpass people’s expectations. There will be an offer there, and we will deliver more. But better that than to offer the sky and then disappoint.” CV Age 44 Family Married to Graham, who works in finance; three children.

        "title": "‘Big four’ accountancy firms PwC and EY fined over LC&F audit failures",
        "content": "“Big four” accountancy firms PricewaterhouseCoopers and EY have been fined a combined £9.3m for a series of failures in auditing the accounts of London Capital &amp; Finance, the collapsed mini-bond firm that wiped out the investments of thousands of savers. It concludes a near four-year investigation by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) into how auditors breached their duties while reviewing the firm’s finances in the years leading up to its demise in 2019. Jamie Symington, the regulator’s deputy executive counsel, said the auditors failed to understand the business and raised the possibility that there could be “material misstatements” in the company’s accounts. “These breaches are made considerably more serious by the fact that all of the auditors knew they were auditing an expanding business which was engaged in selling unregulated financial products to retail investors, and that potential investors might place reliance on the clean audit opinions,” Symington said. London Capital &amp; Finance (LC&amp;F) collapsed in 2019, after taking about £237m from 11,600 investors. Its mini-bonds promised stellar returns of up to 8% a year, but put only a small amount of cash into safe interest-bearing investments. The rest was funnelled into speculative property developments, oil exploration in the Faroe Islands and even a helicopter bought for a company controlled by LC&amp;F. The company collapsed in January 2019. The scandal has led to reprimands for the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, and prompted a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, which is still open. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and one of its staff members – who were appointed as auditors for the 2016 financial year – admitted to eight breaches, the most serious being a failure to adequately understand the nature of LC&amp;F’s business and internal controls. That year, the firm issued £9.2m in bonds and was growing even more rapidly by the time the audit report was signed, the regulator said. However, PwC did not apply “sufficient professional scepticism” while conducting its audit, the FRC said. EY took over as LC&amp;F’s auditor for the 2017 financial year, after PwC resigned. That year, LC&amp;F ramped up its operations, selling a further £53.4m in bonds. But EY fell short, having also failed to understand and properly scrutinise the business, particularly in light of the risk of fraud. EY and one of its employees has since admitted to six breaches of FRC rules. PwC and EY have been severely reprimanded for their failings and hit with fines worth £4.9m and £4.4m respectively. It marks the largest-ever fine issued against EY by the FRC to date, and the third largest for PwC. A smaller auditor, Oliver Clive &amp; Co, was fined a further £42,000 in relation to LC&amp;F’s 2015 audit. All three firms cooperated with the regulator, resulting in reduced fines. “We are sorry our work in 2016 did not meet the standards expected and that we expect of ourselves,” a PwC spokesperson said, adding that the firm had made “significant changes” to its processes and policies over the past eight years. EY said in a statement that it had fully cooperated with the FRC throughout the investigation. “Our 2017 audit of LC&amp;F fell short of our standards and for this we apologise. We have taken significant steps to address the issues identified and we are committed to learning from our mistakes.” Oliver Clive &amp; Co was contacted for comment.",

        "content": "Boeing faces a new investigation after the planemaker told US regulators it might have failed to properly carry out some quality inspections on its 787 Dreamliner planes. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was “investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records”. The regulator said that while the investigation was under way, Boeing employees would reinspect the Dreamliners that had not been delivered to airline customers yet, and the company would develop an “action plan” for the planes that are already in service. The FAA said Boeing “voluntarily informed us in April that it may not have completed required inspections to confirm adequate bonding and grounding where the wings join the fuselage on certain 787 Dreamliner airplanes”. The Boeing executive overseeing the 787 programme, Scott Stocker, wrote in an internal memo, seen by the Guardian, that the problem was reported by an employee and was an instance of “misconduct,” but not “an immediate safety of flight issue”. The memo said the company concluded that “several people had been violating company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed”. “We promptly informed our regulator about what we learned and are taking swift and serious corrective action with multiple teammates,” the memo added. Stocker said the company would “celebrate” the employee who spoke up. Last month, a whistleblower came forward with different quality allegations about several Boeing models and urged Boeing to ground every 787 Dreamliner jet worldwide, warning they were at risk of premature failure. The Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour claimed that the company took shortcuts to reduce production bottlenecks while making the 787. He also raised issues about the production of the 777, another wide-body jet. The FAA is investigating these allegations. Salehpour, who has worked at Boeing for more than a decade, said he faced retaliation, including threats and exclusion from meetings, after raising concerns over problem including a gap between parts of the fuselage of the 787. In January, a door panel was blown out of a Boeing 737 Max aircraft on an Alaska Airlines flight in mid-air, forcing the aircraft into an emergency landing.",

        "title": "BP to cut $2bn in costs as profits miss forecasts ",
        "content": "BP said it would cut $2bn (£1.6bn) in costs from its business by the end of 2026 after reporting worse than expected profits for the first quarter of the year. The oil company revealed that its underlying profits fell to $2.7bn for the first three months of 2024 even as it grew its oil and gas production. Its profits fell from $5bn in the first quarter of last year, to below analyst predictions of almost $2.9bn, in part owing to falling gas prices and an unplanned outage at a large BP refinery in the US. BP told investors it would maintain the pace of its share buybacks despite the worse than expected start to the year by acquiring $3.5bn of shares in the first half of the year. BP has paid a total of $27.4bn to shareholders since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 triggered a surge in global oil and gas prices and record profits across the industry, according to analysis by Global Witness. BP’s payouts have lagged behind its rivals after the company was forced to take a post-tax charge of $24.4bn after exiting its almost one-fifth shareholding in the Russian oil company Rosneft and its other businesses in Russia. The world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, set out plans to pay total dividends of $124.3bn this year, up almost 30% compared with last year, when it also increased payments by 30% to $97.8bn. The payouts are set to rise even after the company reported worse than expected net income of $27.3bn for the first quarter, down from $31.9bn a year ago, compared with an expected net income of $27.6bn. BP chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, told investors that the company would begin a programme to save $2bn in cash costs by 2026 compared with 2023 levels. The former chief financial officer, who replaced Bernard Looney after the latter’s shock exit last September, said he planned to make the savings by choosing fewer new projects to invest in over the coming years. “We have 32 projects to consider over 2024 and 2025,” Auchincloss said. “And 32 is too many – we don’t have the engineers or the capital to do them all. So we need to high grade our portfolio to focus on the best ones.” Auchincloss did not rule out scaling back BP’s planned spend of between $4bn-$6bn a year on low-carbon energy projects in the second half of the decade, and said investment decisions would be “returns driven”. He said BP would decide on which projects to pursue before deciding on whether to translate its stated “aim” to reduce oil and gas emissions by between 20% and 30% from 2019 levels by the end of the decade into a firm target. Auchincloss is under pressure to increase BP’s market valuation, which has suffered in the years since his predecessor set out a “net zero” plan that originally aimed to cut the company’s oil production by 2030 while its rivals plan to grow their fossil fuel production. He has promised a more “pragmatic” approach to BP’s green targets that can create a higher value company for shareholders by moving towards net zero “without wasting money”. BP’s lagging share price has underscored fears that oil companies may choose to abandon the London Stock Exchange in favour of a US listing, where oil companies command higher valuations. Shell created fears of an oil company exodus from the LSE after warning that it has considered moving to New York to improve its market valuation. “It’s not on our agenda,” said Auchincloss. “I believe that the way that we can drive our share price higher is through a laser-beam focus on safety and performance. That’s what drives value.” BP’s annual profits halved last year to almost $14bn after weaker oil and gas market prices caused revenues to fall across the industry. However, the annual profits were still the second-highest reported by BP in more than a decade.",

        "title": "UK AI startup Wayve wins $1bn funding for self-driving car software",
        "content": "The UK self-driving car technology startup Wayve has secured more than $1bn (£800m) of investment to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence-powered vehicles, with the funding round led by Japan’s SoftBank. The $1.05bn investment is backed by the Japanese conglomerate along with the California chipmaker Nvidia and Microsoft, and is the biggest investment to date in a European AI startup. Wayve, which was founded in London in 2017, will use the funds to develop and launch the first “embodied AI” technology for self-driving vehicles in the UK. Embodied AI will enable automated vehicles to learn from and interact with a real-world environment, including the ability to learn from situations that do not follow strict patterns or rules, such as unexpected actions by drivers or pedestrians. Alex Kendall, a co-founder and the chief executive of Wayve, said: “This investment will help us launch our embodied AI products and expand our operations globally. It sends a crucial signal to the market of the strength of the UK’s AI ecosystem, and we look forward to watching more AI companies here thrive and scale.” Kentaro Matsui, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, has taken a seat on Wayve’s board as part of the investment, and said Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s founder, was personally involved. Matsui said: “We have a vision of a peaceful world, free from traffic accidents. Once we learned that we shared a common vision, our team members and Masa were excited and felt we needed to help. We are very proud that we are taking part in this effort.” Wayve’s current technology is integrated into six vehicle platforms including electric cars such as the Jaguar I-Pace and the Ford Mustang MachE, as part of advanced driver assistance systems. All big carmakers are investing in autonomous cars, and a number of startups have sprung up in recent years, including the Alphabet-owned Waymo and the General Motors-owned Cruise in the US. In the UK, Wayve has carried out autonomous car trials, along with the Oxfordshire startup Oxa, formerly called Oxbotica, and the Academy of Robotics. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, has predicted that self-driving cars could be on Britain’s roads by 2026. The automated vehicle bill is expected to become law in the coming weeks and is designed to unlock a “transport revolution” by enabling the safe deployment of self-driving cars, according to the government. The self-driving vehicle industry in the UK is still in its infancy, but the government expects it to be worth £42bn and to create 38,000 skilled jobs by 2035. Between 2018 and 2022, the sector generated £475m of investment and created 1,500 new jobs. Rishi Sunak said the deal “anchors the UK’s position as an AI superpower,” adding: “The fact that a homegrown, British business has secured the biggest investment yet in a UK AI company is a testament to our leadership in this industry.”",

        "title": "Wet weather woes cause damp start to spring for retailers and restaurants",
        "content": "Cold wet weather and caution about spending amid high interest rates and energy bills have delivered a dismal start to spring for retailers and restaurants, the latest industry figures show. Sales were virtually flat across March and April against the same period a year ago, according to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body and advisory firm KPMG. That was despite prices continuing to rise with inflation, suggesting a drop in the volume of items sold over the important Easter period. In the four weeks to the end of April, sales were down by 4%, but this number was partly affected by Easter falling early this year at the end of March. Nonfood sales were the hardest hit, down almost 3% with in-store and online orders down. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said shoppers had delayed spring purchases despite retailers’ efforts to tempt them with heavy discounts: “Dismal weather and disappointing sales led to a depressing start to spring for retailers, even accounting for the change in timing of Easter.” She said a dull, wet April dampened sales growth for clothing and footwear, especially outdoor sportswear, as well as DIY items and garden furniture. Discounts on computers did boost sales as many sought to upgrade devices they had bought a few years ago during the pandemic surge in home technology sales for working and studying from home. The number of shoppers visiting high streets and other retail destinations slumped more than 7% in April, far worse than the 1.3% fall recorded in March, because of poor weather and the shift in the timing of Easter, according to separate data out last week from the BRC and monitoring firm Sensormatic Solutions. “Many retailers are hoping for brighter sales over the summer months as social events ramp up, and consumer confidence could improve with a potential cut in interest rates,” Dickinson said. The difficulties for retailers came to light as Britons remained cautious about “big ticket” outlays including DIY projects and furniture, but were splashing out on days out and trips to the pub, according to the latest Barclays consumer spending report released on Tuesday. It also found travel was being prioritised, with airline spending up by more than 6%. By contrast, clothing sales were down 2.1%, according to the lender, as spring showers deterred shoppers from visiting the high street, while restaurants had another challenging month, down 13%, a similar fall to that in February and March. The figures emerged as 49% of consumers told Barclays they were continuing to rein in discretionary spending, with more than half of that group cutting back on takeaways and dining out. Spending on mortgage and rental payments rose 3.6%, reversing a three-month trend in slowing housing cost inflation. Karen Johnson, head of retail at Barclays, said businesses had been braced for a subdued start to the year but had hoped that discretionary spending would bounce back by mid-year, buoyed up by falling inflation and the prospect of better weather. She said consumer confidence appeared to be improving but “as the summer season approaches, many retailers have adjusted their expectations, anticipating no real recovery until the autumn”. • This article was amended on 7 May 2024. In an earlier version, a number of statistics described as being from “the latest Barclays consumer spending report” were in fact from the previous month’s report. The correct statistics have now been used.",

        "content": "Olive oil prices are set to climb further this year – heading to more than £16 a litre for a bottle of extra virgin – amid a drop in global production to the lowest level in more than a decade. Lower production in Greece, Morocco and Turkey as part of the natural cycle of olive growth is expected to offset an improving situation in Spain and Italy, where trees have suffered from extreme heat and drought in recent years as the climate crisis wreaks havoc on harvests. Just under 2.3m tonnes are expected to be produced globally this year, according to the latest data from the International Olive Council, down from the 2.5m produced in last year’s difficult harvest and well below the 3.4m in 2022. For the second year in a row, demand is expected to outstrip supply, putting pressure on prices for shoppers. The price of a litre of mass-market branded extra virgin olive oil is expected to top £16 next month, according to industry insiders, after an increase to about £14 earlier this year. Some more premium brands such as Odysea and Belazu are already retailing at more than £18 a litre, while Napolina is selling for almost £15 a litre in some stores, with Filippo Berio just over £13. “Supply is difficult and not sufficient to meet demand,” said Walter Zanre, the UK boss of Filippo Berio, one of the world’s biggest olive oil producers, who warned that retail prices were expected to rise again in coming weeks. Some UK supermarkets have already begun putting bottles in security boxes to deter theft of olive oil, which has been named as the most wanted item for shoplifters in Spain. The latest available official UK data shows the average price of a litre bottle of olive oil had already soared by 39% in the year to March to just over £8, according to the Office for National Statistics. The price has more than doubled since 2018 and continues to rise. Production around the world is being affected by more extreme weather caused by the climate crisis. There are hopes that output this year could be helped by a return to more normal weather in Italy and Spain, where trees are just coming into bloom. However, production is expected to be up to 60% lower in Greece and down by more than half in Turkey, as trees in both countries recover from big harvests in 2023. Producer prices for olive oil soared more than 60% in Italy and Spain last month and more than 80% in Greece, according to the IOC. High prices have prompted switches to other oils such as sunflower and rapeseed. The Italian trade body the Associazione Granaria di Milano said bottlers were being forced to replenish depleted stocks, driving up wholesale prices again in recent weeks, after a period of stability since a big price jump in January. “When we get to the other side of the summer it could light the blue touch paper and [wholesalers] will be able to charge whatever they like for what is left,” Zanre said. Zanre said Filippo Berio would be bringing in oil from South America for the second year in a row to support production but added that buying up stock there was more difficult this year because of restrictions on supply in Argentina and Chile.",

        "title": "Bonza administrators worry that 20,000 out-of-pocket airline customers could attend creditors meeting ",
        "content": "Administrators determining the future of the troubled airline Bonza are bracing for as many as 20,000 out-of-pocket customers to join a creditors meeting this week with the federal court hearing that online voting options are being considered. On Tuesday lawyers representing Hall Chadwick, the administrators controlling Bonza after its planes were abruptly repossessed a week ago, appeared before the federal court justice Elizabeth Cheeseman seeking orders to streamline the process for the first creditors meeting on Friday. It will be held amid ongoing efforts to find a new owner for the budget carrier. Cheeseman, sitting in Sydney, heard that 57,933 customers who had future bookings with the airline for flights that had not yet been cancelled – and for which refunds were not available – would be considered contingent creditors for the administration process, along with 120 trade creditors and 323 employees. James Hutton SC, one of the barristers representing the administrators, told Cheeseman there were “serious practical difficulties” preparing for the first meeting scheduled for Friday in Sydney. The court heard that there would be the option for creditors to join virtually and appoint proxies. Hutton said there was a real prospect there could be 20,000 participants. “That would require a stadium,” he said. “There is [a] high degree of uncertainty” regarding the number of expected participants. The administrators were examining how to allow online access including a poll to count votes. Creditors and proxies would have to register a day in advance to be verified. The court also heard Bonza would remain grounded until at least 14 May and employees had been told they would be stood down until then at the earliest. A key reason for the grounding extension was the status of six leased Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft that Bonza operated, which are expected to return to North America. Of the six planes, four had been directly leased to Bonza by an arrangement 49% owned by the airline’s parent company, the US private investment firm 777 Partners. Two other aircraft were leased from another airline part-owned by 777 Partners, Canadian carrier Flair. But a reported breakdown in the relationship between 777 Partners and its financier, the US insurance giant Advantage Capital Holdings, known as A-Cap, led to a change in ownership structure of the leased aircraft last month. A new holding company owned by A-Cap, Phoenix Aviation Capital, took full ownership of the aircraft and subsequently issued orders to recall the planes from Australia so they could be leased to more profitable airlines overseas. Questions about 777 Partners’ financial reliance on A-Cap have led to the Miami-based owner of Bonza being accused of fraud and double-pledging of assets that it didn’t own, according to a lawsuit filed in New York on Friday. The revelations raised questions about the financial situation of 777 Partners and triggered discussion within Australia’s aviation community as to whether Bonza’s business plan had been sound, and close to a potential takeover from a local business figure, before the abrupt termination of its leases and it entering administration on 30 April. Five of the repossessed aircraft are located at Melbourne, the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast airports. The barrister said the administrators were proceeding on the basis that the aircraft leases had been validly terminated before the administrators were appointed. “We do not assert that we have possession of them,” Hutton said. “The lessors have clearly expressed their intention to take their aircraft out of Australian airspace.” Separately on Tuesday, the federal opposition transport spokesperson, Bridget McKenzie, called on the Albanese government to direct financial regulators to immediately investigate 777 Partners, noting their part ownership of the A-League club Melbourne Victory. “Hundreds of Australian Bonza workers and tens of thousands of Australian customers are out-of-pocket because of the decisions made by this foreign-owned company, not Bonza,” McKenzie said. She called on the government to offer financial support to Bonza’s staff and aggrieved customers, noting that when Labor was in opposition in 2020 when Virgin Australia entered administration, it had called for government support to save the carrier from collapse. “Now is the test for Labor – will the prime minister apply the same standards?” McKenzie said. During a radio interview on Tuesday Anthony Albanese dodged a question asking if the government would bail out Bonza. On Monday the competition watchdog chair expressed concern about Bonza’s potential collapse.",

        "content": "Workers at Condé Nast, the media empire behind Vogue, Vanity Fair and GQ, announced a tentative agreement has been reached for a first union contract after threatening to stage a walkout during the Met Gala on Monday evening. The Condé Nast Union, which represents about 540 editorial workers, has been bargaining for a union contract since September 2022. It is affiliated with the NewsGuild of New York. Condé Nast owns a string of leading magazines and publications, including Glamour, Bon Appétit and Teen Vogue. It also owns the New Yorker, although this has a separate union. Back in November, as the company bargained with the Condé Nast Union, it announced plans to lay off 5% of its workforce. It then proposed laying off 94 union members. The proposed layoffs further heated contention between both sides in bargaining, with the union threatening to walk off the job. The union also distributed flyers in New York City, criticizing the opulence of the Vogue editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour – the face and organizer of the fashion industry’s biggest night, the Met Gala – throughout her neighborhood to raise public awareness of the contract fight with the tagline, “Anna wears Prada, workers get nada”. Both sides finally reached a tentative agreement at 3am local time in New York on Monday: the day of this year’s Meta Gala, which some workers had threatened to disrupt. “We made a commitment to do whatever it takes to get our contract,” said Mark Alan Burger, Vanity Fair social media manager and a member of the Condé Nast Union bargaining team. “Our pledge to take any action necessary to get our contract, including walking off the job ahead of the Met Gala, and all the actions we took this week, pushed the company to really negotiate. “We made every effort this week to meet with them and get this contract completed and we’re thrilled to say we did it.” Workers will vote on whether to ratify the agreement – which includes $3.6m in wage increases, including a starting salary floor of $61,500 annually, an increase of two weeks of paid parental leave, just cause protections, conversion of subcontracted workers to staff, and negotiated terms of the previously announced layoffs – later this week. Condé Nast said it was “pleased to come to tentatively agreed terms” with the union. The contract “reflects and supports our core values: our content and journalism; our commitment to diversity and professional development; our industry-leading hiring practices and our competitive wages and benefits,” the company added.",

Then the list starts to make sense – these are the hundreds of suppliers required to keep a castle or two running smoothly. However, the list of near 750 companies who hold royal warrants granted by either the late Queen Elizabeth II or King Charles when he was Prince of Wales is undergoing a shake-up. A warrant becomes void after the death of the grantor, an event that sets in train a massive review that requires companies to reapply so they can continue boasting they provide their goods or services “by appointment to” a senior royal. A year on from King Charles’s coronation – and despite the recent health setbacks in the royal family, including the monarch’s cancer diagnosis – this extensive undertaking, which is managed by the Royal Warrant Holders Association, is well under way King Charles is said to be “looking through” applications from the 172 holders of warrants he granted when he was Prince of Wales who wish to obtain one from him as king now. The decisions on these are expected by the end of this month. Then the focus moves on to the 578 holders of warrants issued by the late queen, which range from the high-end grocer Fortnum &amp; Mason to the late Queen Mother’s favourite tipple, Dubonnet. Application packs for a warrant from the king have already been issued, with answers due in the autumn. For companies eager to get in on the act and – for the first time gain the patronage of Queen Camilla – completely new applications for warrants from the king and queen (who is becoming a grantor) are supposed to open this month. However, the awards will not be made until 2025. The history of the royal warrant can be traced back to medieval times, when competition for regal favour was intense. The process was formalised by the 15th century but it wasn’t until the 19th century it took off as a means to promote British business around the world. Queen Victoria granted 2,000 warrants during her 63-year reign. Craig Beaumont, the chief of external affairs at the Federation of Small Businesses, said companies had told the trade body they were “proud to display the royal arms” and it was an asset to those selling overseas. The Essex jam maker Wilkin &amp; Sons, which is behind the Tiptree brand, has applied for a warrant from the king in the hope of keeping a long tradition alive. It received its first warrant from George V in 1911 and subsequent monarchs have continued the tradition. Scott Goodfellow, the company’s joint managing director, said that a royal warrant “has, for us, always been the best indicator of quality and service and this is recognised by customers both at home and across the globe”. Warrants are only granted to individuals or companies that provide paid-for goods or services to the royal household for at least five years. They are allowed to use the appropriate royal arms on everything from their packaging and advertising to their premises and vehicles. A warrant is usually granted for up to five years and reviewed in the year before expiry. It is hard to gauge how much of sales fillip a royal stamp of approval is, with previous analysis suggesting it could be worth up to 5% of turnover. For British companies selling overseas there is particular excitement about the bankability of younger royals, with Prince William issuing his warrant from next year. Chris Jones, the managing director of Corgi Hosiery in Carmarthenshire, Wales – which makes luxury socks for humans rather than the late queen’s favourite breed of dog – hopes to hear back soon as to whether King Charles will turn the award he granted as Prince of Wales into a king’s warrant. “The warrant is very important to our business, especially in export markets like China and Japan,” Jones said. “It is seen as a mark of top quality and is something we have on our socks that nobody else has. “When we are meeting new retailers it is something that gives them confidence that we make a quality product, and stores like carrying products that carry the warrant.” However, the royal seal comes with strings attached, one of which is discretion. Roughly 20 to 40 warrants are cancelled each year, with a similar number of new ones granted. Benson &amp; Hedges, for example, had its royal warrant revoked in 1999 with the official reason “a lack of demand in royal households”. More recently, the lingerie retailer Rigby &amp; Peller lost its warrant in 2018, supposedly because the company’s director June Kenton revealed details of her work with the royals in her book Storm in a D Cup. If that is the case, warrant holders should tread carefully as the book is light on royal underwear intrigue. The biggest revelation to emerge from her first bra fitting with the late queen was the sovereign’s concern that it might rain and that she was due to host a garden party. (Although Kenton did also reveal giving posters to Diana, Princess of Wales for her sons to put up in their rooms at Eton.) The warrant review triggered by the queen’s death is said to have caused nervousness in some quarters, with fashion brands in particular said to be concerned they would not be able to satisfy the king of their environmental credentials. There has always been a sustainability requirement but applicants report having to set out what their business is doing to work towards net zero. “It’s good the warrants are being reassessed,” one applicant said. “Some big UK brands no longer manufacture here, so I expect they will lose their warrants, which is right. It should only be for proper UK companies.”",

        "content": "Heineken is to spend £39m on reopening about 60 UK pubs and sprucing up “tired” locals in suburban areas in an effort to attract more consumers working from home. The firm, which has 2,400 pubs through its Star pubs and bars arm, plans to reopen 62 long-term-closed venues this year and upgrade 612 outlets, with 94 of these earmarked for makeovers of about £200,000. It said it would concentrate its major refurbishments on suburban pubs, turning them into “premium locals” to take advantage of the shift away from office working since the Covid crisis, as well targeting people looking to save money on travel by drinking near to home. The latest investment will create an estimated 1,075 new jobs and broaden each pub’s use, and comes amid signs of rising consumer confidence as inflation and the cost of living crisis ease. Brewers and pubs were forced to close for months under pandemic restrictions and since then the sector has faced higher costs including energy bills and wages at the same time as consumers have cut back on discretionary spending. The number of pubs in the UK had dropped even before Covid hit, according to the British Beer and Pub Association. Figures from the industry body show a steady decline from 60,800 in 2000 to 47,200 in 2019. However, in recent weeks pub groups have announced plans for fresh investment in a sign of renewed confidence in the sector. Tim Martin, the founder and chair of JD Wetherspoon, said in March he had a list of 130 towns and cities where he wanted to open a pub, as he announced an eightfold rise in pre-tax profits in the six months to January 2024. Greene King announced last week that it would invest £40m in a new brewery in East Anglia. Heineken UK, which is the world’s second largest brewer, said its latest investment meant it would have reopened 156 long-term-closed pubs, including ones in Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Cumbria, between the start of 2023 and the end of 2024, which would reduce the number of closed pubs in its estate to levels last seen before Covid. Most of its 2,400 pubs are leased out to small firms and entrepreneurs. Lawson Mountstevens, the managing director of Star Pubs, said people were now looking for “maximum value” from visits to their local and wanted good-quality food and drink as well as additional reasons to go out such as sports screenings. “Pubs have proved their enduring appeal after all the disruption of recent years. Star is on track to have the lowest number of closed pubs since 2019,” he said.",

        "title": "M25 weekend closure: drivers told to stick to diversion to avoid London Ulez charges",
        "content": "Drivers tempted to bypass the official diversion for this weekend’s M25 motorway closure have been warned of potential ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) charges if they stray off course. The London orbital motorway is having its second ever planned closure, with a busy stretch in the south-west closed in both directions for works, potentially bringing long delays and congestion for thousands of drivers. National Highways has urged motorists to avoid travel if possible or stick to the official diversions. Drivers of non-Ulez-compliant vehicles entering the clean air zone will not be charged as long as they stay on the marked route, but will otherwise be liable for the £12.50 charge if they follow their satnav for an attempted shortcut. Only petrol vehicles more than 18 years old or diesels more than nine years old are normally liable for the charge, which was expanded to cover the whole of Greater London last year. The M25 will be closed in both directions between junctions nine and 10 in Surrey from 9pm on Friday until 6am on Monday while concrete beams for a new bridge and a gantry are lifted into place. The diversion for those who wish to rejoin the motorway runs for 19 miles along A-roads in Surrey and Greater London. Jonathan Wade, a National Highways senior project manager, told the PA news agency: “Although the (Ulez) cameras will be active, no enforcement action will be taken. However, if you ignore the diversion signs and do your own thing, then if your vehicle’s not compliant, you do run the risk of getting caught.” The traffic agency has urged drivers to follow the main route to minimise the risk of rural gridlock, with thousands of cars normally using the stretch of motorway every hour. This weekend is the second of five planned closures of the M25 in a £317m works scheme, after the first ever planned daytime shutdown in March on the neighbouring stretch from junctions 10 to 11. Fears that the zigzag diversion routes then used between Cobham and Woking would host epic jams were eventually unrealised, with only a third of the normal volumes of traffic using the roads after a widespread awareness campaign. However, Wade said there was a “very real” risk that the benign outcome of early March could make motorists complacent about the fresh warnings to reassess journeys. Other stretches of the M25 will also be disrupted this weekend, with work to retrofit more emergency refuges on its sections designated as smart motorway with no hard shoulder. The RAC also warned of more congested roads ahead, with this week’s national rail strikes potentially forcing more travellers into cars. The M25 will close for three more weekends this year, with the next one scheduled for August. The works will increase the number of lanes and improve junction 10, one of Britain’s busiest motorway junctions.",

        "title": "Boeing hopes to polish its reputation with Starliner crew capsule launch",
        "content": "Boeing has an opportunity on Monday night to restore some luster to its tarnished name, with the scheduled first crewed launch from Florida of Starliner, a pioneering new capsule designed to transform human exploration of space. Although the company’s space operations are entirely independent of its aviation wing, which has been plagued by a recent series of safety and quality issues, the spacecraft’s pathway to the Cape Canaveral launchpad, and planned 10.34pm ET liftoff, has been similarly bumpy. The two Nasa astronauts who will ride Starliner to the International Space Station should have taken flight in 2017, before supply and production hold-ups, hardware and software issues, and the failure of an uncrewed test flight five years ago skewered the schedule. While Boeing was working to fix its problems, its chief rival in commercial spaceflight, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, completed 340 launches, sent more than 50 astronauts into orbit and advanced its mighty Starship, the world’s largest and most powerful rocket, intended to carry humans to Mars by the end of the next decade. Boeing managers, however, are confident the setbacks have been overcome, due to the dedication of hundreds of its own employees, as well as almost 450 suppliers from 37 states. If successful, Monday’s week-long test mission will lead to six further astronaut rotation flights to the space station that Nasa has ordered as part of its commercial crew program. “No matter what is going on around us, no matter how difficult the situation, the people on this team just keep their heads down doing the things that, in the moment, can feel impossible,” Aaron Kraftcheck, senior manager for Starliner’s flight software, design and development, told reporters last month. “The whole company has rallied around us. I get emotional talking about it.” The Starliner capsule, officially called CST-100 (crew space transportation), has interior space similar to a midsize SUV, and has a capacity of seven, although it will be configured for four astronauts and cargo for space station flights. Each capsule can be flown up to 10 times, Boeing says, with a six-month turnaround between each mission. Innovation includes Starliner’s weldless design, which reduces the risk of structural failure, and highly developed software that allows the spacecraft to fly, navigate and course-correct autonomously. It means the American astronauts onboard Monday’s flight, Sunita Williams and Barry “Butch” Wilmore, each veterans of three space shuttle missions, will mostly be monitoring its progress in communication with ground crews, but can step in to take over manually if needed. “To do the cool stuff that Starliner does, there is lots of complexity in the system and in each component,” Kraftcheck said. “The most challenging and rewarding part is figuring out how to make it all work together. “[It’s] like an orchestra. Starliner has many instruments playing different, complicated parts, but it’s the timing and interaction between each instrument that is especially critical.” Boeing showcased the capsule during a final uncrewed test mission in May 2022, its successful docking with the space station making it the second privately built, human-capable US spacecraft to reach the outpost after SpaceX’s Dragon. The astronauts have been in quarantine at the Kennedy Space Center since 25 April to prepare for Monday’s flight, but their overall wait has been much longer. Williams was assigned to the flight in 2018, and Wilmore upgraded from a backup role two years later. Wilmore said the delays had only helped them become more familiar with the capsule, and prepared for the challenges of the mission. “We’ve been through training and we have our fingerprints on every single procedure that exists for this spacecraft,” he told a virtual press conference from Cape Canaveral. “We’re fully trained in all aspects of Starliner.”",

        "title": "Vanessa Hudson has provided a soft landing for Qantas as the airline cuts deal with ACCC",
        "content": "In agreeing to pay a $100m penalty and compensate tens of thousands of customers to the tune of $20m for selling them tickets on already-cancelled flights, Qantas has abandoned its farcical claim that as an airline it doesn’t sell seats on a specific service, but rather a “bundle of rights”. For new CEO Vanessa Hudson – who stepped into the top job eight months ago after allegations aired in the consumer watchdog’s legal action against Qantas hastened former boss Alan Joyce’s retirement – the landmark settlement is a retreat from her predecessor’s confrontational style that many argued had trashed the airline’s brand. While the move away from the “bundle of rights” argument – where Qantas claimed it did not sell customers tickets to any particular flight, but rather a “bundle of rights” that includes alternative options in the event of cancellations – is a positive step, the airline seems keen to deliver the headline of their concession without delving into the details of the settlement. For an airline that knows how to choreograph a media opportunity when there’s good news to trumpet, Hudson’s telephone-only conference call to address questions on Monday speaks volumes. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) case had initially been filed based on cancellation data during a May-July 2022 monitoring period – a window when 15,000 out of 66,000 Qantas services were cancelled – alleging it had advertised and sold tickets for more than 8,000 flights that it had already cancelled in its internal system, while taking up to 47 days to notify affected customers. However, Qantas acknowledged on Monday that through working with the ACCC on a settlement, it had unearthed thousands more instances of customers who were sold tickets to flights that had already been cancelled. Qantas has agreed to make compensation payments of between $225 and $450 to 86,597 consumers who, between 21 May 2021 and 26 August 2023, booked or were re‑accommodated on a domestic or international flights after a decision to cancel the flight had already been made. Both parties agreed the issue had been caused by a failure of Qantas’ internal systems, and this failure to invest in new technological improvements and customer improvements despite delivering healthy profits and treats for shareholders has been an imbalance that Hudson has already spoken about addressing. Notably, a compromise saw the ACCC agree to drop its allegation that Qantas had charged fees for no service, while the airline dropped its “bundle of rights” defence. “They are no longer going forward to defend on that basis. They are accepting and admitting that they misled customers by selling tickets represented on the basis of the continuation of a flight at a particular time,” ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. Qantas has also promised to stop selling cancelled flights within 24 hours of its decision to cancel, as well as to notify customers of cancelled flights no more than 48 hours from deciding to cancel the flight, in commitments that also apply to its budget carrier Jetstar. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Does this mean that travellers can now have more confidence in their booking? And will the warning that date and time of departure do not form part of a customer’s contract with the airline now vanish from Qantas’ booking websites? Hudson, when pressed on this, could make no guarantees. “Even on the ACCC’s website, it notes that airlines cannot guarantee specific flight times on specific dates,” she said. The total amount of the settlement may have left some of Qantas’ fiercest critics wondering if the airline got off lightly. Initially Cass-Gottlieb had been seeking $250m in penalties but on Monday said she was satisfied with the lesser penalty because it secured an early settlement, admissions of misconduct and the commitments to improve in the future. Qantas’ strong financial position of late – in February Hudson handed down a $1.25bn half-year pre-tax profit and rewarded shareholders with a $400m buyback, after a record $2.47bn full-year profit in 2022-23 – suggests the airline can absorb the $120m hit. In cutting a deal with the ACCC – which has identified Qantas as the most complained about company for two years running – Hudson has saved the airline potentially hundreds of millions of dollars and spared it from a protracted legal dispute with negative coverage. (The cost of the alternative, Joyce-era approach will play out shortly when Qantas learns how much compensation – expected to exceed $100m – it must pay over the illegal outsourcing of 1,700 ground handlers that it fought tooth and nail to overturn.) Despite this, the settlement is a clear success for the ACCC. Its allegations set the public debate about Qantas’ dominance into overdrive, triggered talk about increasing competition and consumer protections in aviation, with discussion of a mandatory cash compensation scheme for delays – something Qantas fiercely opposes – raised in Canberra ahead of the upcoming aviation white paper. To this end, even if they’re not one of the 86,597 customers set to receive payments from Qantas, the travelling Australian public are also set to reap the rewards of the ACCC’s case.",

        "title": "Farmer confidence at lowest in England and Wales since survey began, NFU says",
        "content": "Farmers’ confidence has hit its lowest level in at least 14 years, a long-running survey by the biggest farming union in Britain has found, with extreme weather and the post-Brexit phasing-out of EU subsidies blamed for the drop. The National Farmers’ Union warned there had been a “collapse of confidence” and that the outlook was at its lowest since the annual poll of its members in England and Wales began in 2010. Most farms are expecting to reduce food production next year, with arable farming particularly badly hit. Tom Bradshaw, the NFU’s president, pointed to extreme wet weather and the phasing-out of EU basic payment scheme (BPS) subsidies as key reasons for the downturn. “Our concern today is that if members don’t have confidence, then we as a country can’t deliver food security,” said Bradshaw. The annual survey of almost 800 farmers asks respondents to rate the prospects of their business, with the four responses all given weighted scores – very negative (-1), negative (-0.5), positive (0.5) and very positive (1). These are added up to give an overall confidence index score. The results saw short-term confidence, covering the next 12 months, score –25, while mid-term confidence, covering the next three years, hit –22. The previous low for short-term confidence was –18 in 2016, while for mid-term confidence, it was the –12 posted in 2018. England’s wettest 18-month period since the Met Office began collecting data in 1836 has left farms across the country flooded, and many unable to plant crops. The survey revealed that 82% had had their farms affected by the rain, with 30% saying they had experienced very negative impacts. Analysis by the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) last week forecast that crops could be down by nearly a fifth as a result of the wet weather, increasing the likelihood that the prices of bread, beer and biscuits will rise. The NFU survey found that overall production intentions scored –14 over the next 12 months, the lowest since the survey began. Arable farms appear to have suffered most, scoring -35 on the production index, while mixed farms scored -17, and poultry and eggs scored –7. The BPS payments were supposed to be replaced by the government’s own sustainable farming incentive (SFI) subsidies but the rollout of these has been delayed. Respondents to the survey identified this as one of the key issues shaping the year ahead, with 86% of farmers saying it would have a negative effect. Bradshaw said: “This year we’re going to be down to 50% or less of our previous BPS payments, and this comes at a time where farmer borrowing is increasing, where the cost of servicing that debt is higher. “And now we’ve had this incredible period of weather, which has meant that whichever sector of farming you’re in, your costs of production have increased and your outputs have decreased. It is the perfect storm of events.”",

        "content": "Qantas will fork out $100m as a civil penalty and pay $20m to customers in compensation, after striking a deal with the consumer watchdog over landmark legal action for allegedly selling tens of thousands of tickets to flights that had already been cancelled in its system. On Monday, Qantas announced it had come to an agreement with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to resolve the court proceedings lodged in August last year, alleging it had advertised and sold tickets for more than 8,000 flights that it had already cancelled in its internal system, revelations which precipitated the early retirement of the former CEO Alan Joyce. In a statement, Qantas said it would “commence a projected $20 million remediation program for impacted passengers, with payments to customers ranging from $225 to $450, and subject to the approval of the Federal Court of Australia, will pay a $100 million civil penalty”. It is the largest settlement for a corporate penalty the ACCC has ever agreed to. However, the record penalty for a breach of Australia’s consumer law was $125m – issued to Volkswagen in 2019 for deceiving customers over diesel emissions. The proposed penalty will need to be approved by the federal court, though Qantas will start the “remediation program in advance of the Court approval process”. The chair of the ACCC, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said as part of the settlement Qantas had admitted that it misled consumers. “Qantas’s conduct was egregious and unacceptable. Many consumers will have made holiday, business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled,” Cass-Gottlieb said. She said Qantas had also undertaken to “not engage in this type of conduct in the future”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Qantas CEO, Vanessa Hudson, said “today represents another important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier … we have since updated our processes and are investing in new technology across the Qantas Group to ensure this doesn’t happen again”. While the flight data during a May-July 2022 monitoring period formed the basis of the initial legal allegations – a window when 15,000 out of 66,000 Qantas services were cancelled – the airline said that through working with the ACCC on a settlement, it had unearthed thousands more instances of customers who were sold tickets to flights that had already been cancelled. As such, Qantas has agreed to make compensation payments to 86,597 consumers who, between 21 May 2021 and 26 August 2023, booked or were re‑accommodated on a domestic or international flight scheduled to depart between 1 May 2022 until 10 May 2024 after Qantas had already decided to cancel it. Only those who booked on a flight two or more days after the cancellation decision had been made will be compensated, with Qantas to contact eligible customers next month. The 26 August 2023 cut off is the date by which Qantas is confident internal issues were rectified so that its system would no longer sell tickets to flights that had already been cancelled. As part of the deal, Qantas has also agreed to notify customers of cancelled flights as soon as practicable, stipulated as no more than 48 hours from deciding to cancel the flight. It has also undertaken to stop selling cancelled flights as soon as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours of its decision to cancel. The undertaking also applies to its low-cost subsidiary, Jetstar. Of customers affected, 94% were flying on domestic or trans-Tasman routes, with the remainder flying on the international network. The financial hit of the penalty and remediation program would be recognised as an expense in the group’s statutory income statement for the current financial year. In August, the ACCC lodged proceedings in the federal court alleging Qantas was continuing to advertise and sell tickets for more than 8,000 flights on its website for an average of two weeks, and in some cases up to 47 days, after cancelling the flights. The watchdog also alleged that for more than 10,000 flights scheduled over the same period in 2022, Qantas did not notify existing ticketholders that their flights had been cancelled for an average of about 18 days, and in some cases for up to 48 days. Qantas, in its defence to the legal action, claimed it doesn’t sell customers tickets to any particular flight, but rather a “bundle of rights” that includes alternative options in the event of cancellations, as it responded to allegations it sold tickets to thousands of already cancelled flights. The airline also claimed the sales occurred due to its online booking system, and that informing customers that it had already cancelled flights they were booked on would have created “uncertainty and frustration” and overwhelmed its phone lines when they were all automatically notified of the cancellation without being allocated a replacement flight. Prior to the settlement, Cass-Gottlieb had said she wanted to see Qantas hit with penalties of at least $250m, twice the current record penalty. However, on Monday she said she was satisfied with the lesser penalty because it secured an early settlement, admissions of the misconduct by Qantas, and a commitment to improve in the future, including in its budget carrier Jetstar’s operations. “If we had gone through and Qantas had continued to contest and defend, in that case we would have sought multiple of hundreds of millions of dollars,” she said. In what was a compromise deal, the ACCC agreed to drop its allegation that Qantas had charged fees for no service, while the airline dropped its defence that it only sells a bundle of rights rather than a ticket to a specific flight. Hudson said this concession would not have implications for how it sells flights going forward, where sales terms and conditions stipulate that date and time of departure do not form part of a customers contract with the airline. “Even on the ACCC’s website, it notes that airlines cannot guarantee specific flight times on specific dates…There are always going to be instances where changes to flight times or cancellations need to occur,” Hudson said. In February, Hudson handed down a $1.25bn half-year pre-tax profit in her first financial results leading the airline, and rewarded shareholders with a $400m buyback after a tumultuous period that unseated her predecessor. The profit result was tracking 13% down from the record $2.47bn full-year profit posted in 2022-23.",

        "title": "Calls grow for urgent talks to protect future of Grangemouth oil refinery",
        "content": "The UK and Scottish governments have been asked to arrange urgent talks to protect the future of Scotland’s only remaining oil refinery at Grangemouth. Daniel Johnson, Scottish Labour’s economy spokesperson, has written to PetroChina, part of the joint venture that owns the site, seeking to discuss the future of the complex where oil refining is due to cease next year. He is also urging the Scottish and Westminster governments to arrange meetings. Petroineos has said it is preparing to shut the Grangemouth facility, where refining has taken place since 1919, to convert it into a fuels import terminal. Petroineos, a joint venture formed in 2011 between PetroChina, the state-owned Chinese oil company, and Ineos, which is controlled by billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, will operate the complex as normal until at least spring 2025. After that it would operate as an import oil terminal facility only, prompting concerns for the future of 500 jobs. Grangemouth, on the Forth estuary, is one of six remaining oil refineries in Britain and supplies much of the petrol and diesel for forecourts in Scotland and the north of England. “Grangemouth is one of Scotland’s key strategic assets, but neither of Scotland’s governments seems to be serious about protecting its future. Both of our governments must get round the table to discuss both urgent action and a real long-term plan to keep Grangemouth working,” Johnson said in a statement. He said that Labour’s green economy plans would aim to make the Grangemouth site “home to the industries of the future” by setting up a decarbonisation hub and a linked carbon capture and storage project. Johnson added that he wanted to know why oil refining was still likely to stop by 2025 when the most recent accounts from Petroineos show the site is profitable, and that it has now secured critical investment in the hydrocracker. Unite, the trade union, is among groups talking with Petroineos to explore ways to extend the lifespan of the oil refinery’s operations, and to develop alternative energy sources at the complex. Gillian Martin, the minister for energy, just transition and fair work, told the Scottish parliament last week that she had met Petroineos in March and the Scottish government continued to work with the company. She said the Scottish government was examining whether or not Grangemouth could become a biorefinery. It said: “The Grangemouth site and its workforce are crucial to Scotland’s economy and our transition to net zero. “The Scottish government is committed to working collaboratively with Petroineos, UK ministers and Unite the union to explore the options available to accelerate new employment opportunities.” A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “This is a commercial decision for the refinery owners, Petroineos. However, we know this is a concerning time for workers and their families, and are working closely with Grangemouth refinery on the long-term future of the site and how they are supporting staff.” Petroineos said: “We will continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders as we prepare for a transition at the Grangemouth refinery.”",

        "title": "UK installs record number of public electric vehicle chargers",
        "content": "The UK has installed a record number of public electric car chargers this year, as companies race to keep up with the growing number of battery vehicles on British roads. Nearly 6,000 new chargers were installed during the first three months of 2024, according to quarterly figures from data company Zapmap published by the Department for Transport. About 1,500 of those were rapid chargers, capable of charging a car in less than an hour. There were just under 60,000 public chargers installed in the UK by 1 April, a 49% increase compared with a year earlier. The number of public chargers of all speeds in the UK has doubled since the start of 2022. Some electric car companies, including global leaders Tesla and China’s BYD, are experiencing falling sales as higher interest rates hit disposable incomes. That has meant that the share of electric models in total car sales has stalled in the UK at 15.5% this year, after previously rapid growth. One of the most common reasons cited by people concerned about shifting to EVs is range anxiety, or the fear that their car will run out of power before they can find a charger. In many parts of the world – and notably in the US, the world’s second-largest car market – that concern can be well founded. However, in the UK the problem is being addressed and the number of black spots, at least in areas with high demand, is reducing rapidly. Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive, a thinktank focused on electric cars, said improvements were evident in many areas that had previously been poorly served. He said this was partly a result of councils gradually taking advantage of central government grants to install chargers. “I think there is a coming together of two things,” Nelmes said. “Some of the barriers have been mitigated. And the private sector has woken up to the opportunity.” More than 1m electric cars have been sold in the UK. Only 6% of EV drivers in England surveyed last year by the Electric Vehicle Association said they experience range anxiety either very often or fairly often, while 94% said they had range anxiety occasionally, rarely or never. The region with the fastest growth in charger numbers per person was north-east England, followed by the south-west. The situation also improved in Northern Ireland, although it remained by far the worst-served part of the UK in terms of charger numbers, with only 29 per 100,000 people. The best served region has always been London, which has 221 chargers per 100,000 people, as companies chase a wealthier population more likely to own an electric car. Many wealthy neighbourhoods in the capital do not have off-street parking, meaning EV buyers are reliant on public charging.",

        "title": "Scientists pour scorn on mushroom coffee, the latest ‘healthy’ food trend",
        "content": "Sipping mushroom coffee sounds like a weird camping trip anecdote but more Britons are embracing this alternative morning pick-me-up as “mushroom mania” sweeps the high street. With the food industry eager to cash in on demand for “functional foods” that promise extra health benefits, medicinal mushrooms – not the button kind you put in a stew – are turning up in hot drinks, supplements and even beer. While Britons seem receptive – health food store Holland &amp; Barrett says that searches on its website for “functional mushrooms” are up 50% on a year ago – a recent investigation by Which? put the products in the category of “health products you don’t need”. “There isn’t enough evidence yet to suggest they work and the vast majority don’t have authorised health claims in the UK,” the consumer champion concluded of products made from mushrooms including reishi, lion’s mane and chaga. Close reading of the packaging showed the benefits were often derived from other ingredients with authorised health claims, such as omega-3, and vitamins B12 and D. While mushrooms may contain beneficial nutrients such as antioxidants and beta-glucan, its researchers said, they were essentially “incidental” in many of the supplements. Mushroom-based hot drinks appeal to people who want to reduce their caffeine intake but also to the 35% of consumers, and half of 16- to 34-year-olds, who told Mintel they were interested in food and drink with “healthy ingredients based on ‘ancient wisdom’ such as Ayurveda and Chinese medicine”, said Kiti Soininen, its category director of UK food and drink research. Demand for these products is growing thanks to an advertising blitz on social media, word of mouth and the fact they are stocked more widely. While consumers often buy direct from brands such as Dirtea, Spacegoods and Reformed, they are an increasingly common sight in pharmacies and health stores, including Boots and Holland &amp; Barrett. “Functional mushrooms have been a growing category at H&amp;B, as our customers seek out the latest trending health and wellness products,” said a Holland &amp; Barrett spokesperson. “There is increasing awareness of the benefits of mushrooms for both internal and external use, with emerging evidence that the natural adaptogens they contain may support with overall wellbeing.” It said it had just added 13 new products to its range. “All of the products we sell are carefully selected by our team of experts and comply with food labelling legislation and permitted claims.” Neil Marrakchi, cofounder of Reformed, says people often get confused and think of magic mushrooms, asking questions such as: “Will I have weird dreams?” The answer, he said, is: “No.” The young entrepreneur set out to “create the healthiest coffee in the world” resulting in a heavily fortified blend that includes mushrooms (lion’s mane, chaga, maitake and shiitake), collagen and MCT oil, and costs £40 a packet. Its more established rival Spacegoods is growing fast and expects to turn over £10m this year as customers gravitate to its chocolate-flavoured Rainbow Dust which comes in technicolour packaging and promises “zero jitters/crashing”. Matthew Kelly, the Spacegoods founder, says the coffee replacement, loaded with 15 supplements and which recently went into Boots, avoids the need to “stack” vitamins. At present its customer base is split between men and women but long-term he expects the “Lululemon audience” of 25- to 45-year-old women will be its sweet spot. Spacegoods has not done its own clinical studies but would like to in the future, Kelly says, adding there is a lot of evidence around the specific ingredients it uses. “If it was bogus, we wouldn’t have 15,000 subscribers that buy the products every month and tell us how great it is.” While many of the brands share the testimonials of “happy” customers and promote positive reviews on their websites, the science community is scathing of the evidence base for the latest in a long line of wellness trends. Some experts point out that many people feel better when they switch to a mushroom blend not because of a fungi feelgood effect but because they generally contain less caffeine, with a large section of the population very sensitive to the stimulant. Prof Nicholas Money, a mycologist at Miami University in Ohio, who previously told the Guardian that some of the claims being made were “without scientific foundation and amount to little more than snake oil”, told a recent episode of BBC Radio 4’s Sliced Bread programme devoted to the topic that it was “complete BS”. “Mushrooms probably do contain some really, really useful compounds but I want to see the science,” said Money, who published a review on medicinal mushrooms in 2016 and whose book Molds, Mushrooms, and Medicines came out this year. “Show me the evidence – that’s my bottom line with all of these products. On the plus side, probably, these products are not harming any consumers … the placebo effect is so powerful if somebody feels better after drinking mushroom coffee, go for it.”",

        "title": "What is a US small business? One owner explains",
        "content": "Last week was National Small Business Week, which went virtually unnoticed by most business owners who were busy working. The Small Business Administration and big brands try so hard to celebrate small businesses with events like these. But what they miss are a few sobering facts. The number of actual small businesses is much fewer than reported. According to Pew Research, almost two-thirds of our country’s 33m small businesses have fewer than four employees, with most of them being solely owned and operated. Yes, the number of startups grew during and in the immediate aftermath of Covid. But these are mostly freelance, side gig or independent “businesses” for workers who need extra money. Is a side gig a small business? Maybe? To me, a real business is an employer-owned business, one that has paychecks and workmen’s compensation and HR policies. According to the US Census Bureau, there are only about 7m employer-owned companies in the country. That’s a far cry from 33m. Small businesses still aren’t very diverse. Black-owned businesses are regularly featured in the TV shows from Queen Sugar to Atlanta and Insecure. Anne Hathaway is the cool entrepreneur running an online fashion business in The Intern. Lorelai Gilmore owns and runs the Dragonfly Inn in Gilmore Girls. Mindy Lahiri starts her own fertility clinic in The Mindy Project. Things are changing but this is not reality. According to Pew Research, 85% of our nation’s business owners are white and 76% are men. And, according to the Small Business Administration, more than half are over the age of 50. I speak at many associations and groups representing industries around the country, and when I look out at the audience I have to look pretty hard to find a female or a Black or brown face in the crowd. The numbers are creeping up but there’s still a long, long way to go before we see the kind of the equal representation that we see on TV or on the Small Business Administration’s website. Most small businesses don’t earn much money. Do you ever walk by that coffee shop, or that boutique with three pairs of shoes in the window, or the store that just sells cookies and wonder to yourself how many cups of coffee, pairs of shoes or cookies they have to sell to earn enough profit to pay themselves? You’re not wrong to wonder. The fact is that most of these small businesses don’t make much money at all. According to research from the financing site Fundera, small businesses with no employees have an average annual revenue of $46,978, the average small business owner makes $71,813 a year, and 86.3% of small business owners make less than $100,000 a year in income. Opening up a retail location requires rent, utilities, insurance and payroll – and that’s even before you start buying the ingredients for coffee or cookies or inventorying shoes. The business owners who make money are generally the ones that have people, machines and multiple locations that generate a higher volume of revenue which, at a certain margin, can sustain a profitable cashflow above overhead. This requires capital and sweat and time and even then there are no guarantees that a Starbucks won’t open across the street or a slowing economy forces people to reconsider a $5 cookie. Profits are needed to sustain a business, not just sustainable materials. Finally, no one really knows how “small businesses” are faring. Not a week goes by for me without getting some survey or research gauging small business “optimism” or “sentiment”, and they’re all in conflict. The National Federation of Independent Businesses says that small business confidence is the lowest it’s been since 2012. The US Chamber of Commerce says that small businesses see a “stable” economic environment. Latino business owners are showing a “growing optimism” according to Verizon. A poll of 500-plus business owners from a marketing firm “paints a picture of cautious optimism and resilience”. The messaging platform Slack says that many small business owners are calling 2024 a “make or break year”. Republicans say small businesses are struggling. Democrats say they’re doing just fine. Just as opinions differ for the economy and the weather, no one really knows how small businesses in this country are doing. And you can’t blame them – we live in a big country. A roofing company can be crushing it in Texas yet a similar company can be struggling in Wisconsin. A tech company may be facing cashflow issues where an energy company is flush. You can’t just generalize.",

        "title": "Tory election hopes rest on the UK economy – they could go the way of the monasteries | Larry Elliott",
        "content": "Tory MPs have been busy this past week and probably not found the time to watch Shardlake, the adaptation of CJ Sansom’s book set during the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s, but once the dust has settled from last week’s elections they might want to take a look. This was a turbulent period. Having forced through his own version of Brexit through the break with Rome, Henry VIII then in effect nationalised the assets of religious houses dotted around England, Wales and Ireland. It was a seminal moment in the development of British capitalism and the nation state. But what should alarm Rishi Sunak is the speed with which the monasteries went from being a mighty presence in the land to extinction. A process that began in 1536 was pretty much over by 1540. Something similar could be happening to the Tory party today. Less than five years ago, the Conservatives won an 80-seat majority at the 2019 general election. On the basis of last week’s evidence from local elections they will do well to avoid a complete wipeout next time round. Andy Street’s defeat in the West Midlands mayoral race showed how bad things are for the prime minister. Sunak still hopes an improving economy will boost his party’s survival hopes and there are three pieces of economic news coming up in the next two weeks that ought to be helpful: the interest-rate decision by the Bank of England on Thursday, the growth figures on Friday and the inflation numbers the following week. The Bank’s monetary policy committee is not going to cut borrowing costs immediately but it is expected to send out a signal that a reduction will not be long in coming. The first move could come in late June, but mortgage rates will come down before that if the hint of an impending cut is strong enough. On the following day, Office for National Statistics figures will show that the UK emerged from last year’s shallow recession in the first three months of 2024, with the economy expanding by 0.3% or 0.4% in the first quarter of the year. Finally, the latest bulletin on the cost of living is likely to show the annual inflation rate in April dropping from 3.2% to somewhere close to the government’s 2% target, mainly due to the previous year’s big jump in domestic energy bills not being replicated this year. The exit from recession and the fall in inflation will allow Sunak to say the economy has turned a corner, something the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will dispute in a speech this Tuesday. Reeves says there is a gulf between the message from Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and what voters think is happening, and that the public doesn’t buy the idea that things are getting better. There are reasons for that, Reeves will argue. The first is that numbers on a graph – this one going down, another going up – mean very little to people. The inflation rate is falling but that means prices are simply rising at a slower rate. The cost of the weekly shop for the average family is 25% higher than it was two years ago. A second reason why the Conservatives are not seeing any benefit from the economy is that Hunt and Sunak are celebrating a distinctly average performance. The UK, according to the latest forecast from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, will grow by just 0.4% in 2024, which would make it the second worst in the G7 group of large industrial nations after Germany. Likewise, an inflation rate of 2% might look good in comparison with its 11.1% peak in October 2022 but merely means the Bank of England is doing what it is supposed to do. There is obviously an element of political calculus in the timing of Reeves’s speech. She wants to get her retaliation in first, before ministers hit the news studios to trumpet that happy times are here again. While the shadow chancellor intends to leave nothing to chance, she has little to worry about. Quarterly growth of 0.3-0.4% would be fine for a government 20-25 points behind in the polls if this were midterm, but not for a government fast approaching a general election. There is always a lag before better news feeds through into the public consciousness and on this occasion there are reasons – Partygate, Liz Truss’s brief premiership and NHS waiting lists for example – why the process is taking longer than usual. The Conservatives say that voters don’t seem particularly keen on Labour either – and they are right about that. There is none of the enthusiasm for Sir Keir Starmer that there was when Tony Blair was leader of the opposition before the 1997 election. This, though, is worse news for Sunak and Hunt than it is for Starmer and Reeves. Voters are unwilling to give the Conservatives a hearing under any circumstances and expectations are so low for Labour that it wouldn’t take much to exceed them. There will be no victory from the jaws of defeat, as there was in 1992. The economy is going to remain in a low gear at least until the election, so the best the prime minister and chancellor can hope for is damage limitation. The Conservative party has proved to be a formidable election-winning machine but the lessons from history are there. Following their split over the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 it took 28 years for the Conservatives to form another majority government. The result of the general election is not in doubt. A more intriguing question is whether the Tories survive defeat or go the way of the monasteries.",

        "title": "Why Labour leapt on board with private open access train providers",
        "content": "A direct train from London to Wrexham? The chance to whiz to Scotland for less than £50? Trains run by a firm specialising in a single route, competing to lure customers away from the expensive big operators? What’s not to like? Given the promise of cheaper fares to under-served UK destinations, it is perhaps little wonder that Labour’s plan for a “pragmatic” renationalisation of the railways matches the Conservatives’ policy on “open access” train providers. It also signals that the party remains open for business. That means likes of Lumo, which in 2021 joined Hull Trains and Grand Central on the east coast mainline, can rest easy after the local elections, even while parent companies FirstGroup and Arriva face ejection from main national rail routes under a Labour government. Privately owned open access operators are a curiosity. Rightwing thinktanks would love to see a multitude of them competing on the railways. But their scope is limited by physical constraints such as depots, track space, timetables, stations and connections. So far, only the east coast trio have stayed (as well as, technically, Heathrow Express and Eurostar), accounting for 3.8m journeys in 2022-23 (the nationalised London North Eastern Railway accounts for 23.4m). As well as demonstrating that the party is not wedded to ideology, retaining open access suits Labour because it primarily benefits northern regions and “red wall” constituencies, bringing local jobs and cheaper direct trains. But the industry has long been divided, with some maintaining that the taxpayer would be better off without them. One senior railway source argued that, given capacity constraints, open access operators undermined the wider public good. That limited capacity was the reason for massive outlay on building HS2 and expensive upgrades on the conventional railway. In their view, open access operators were “gaming the system”, and rules meant to protect the main contracted train company were exacerbating the problem. To win a contract with the Office of Rail and Road, an open access operator has to show that its trains would not be “abstracting” revenue (taking fare income from the incumbent). But that required a particular pattern of station stops, the source said. “You get people stopping randomly to meet the regulatory threshold for abstraction – it just further restricts efficient utilisation of the railway.” Proponents argue that it allows different stations and routes to get a decent showing. Ian Yeowart, founder of Grand Central, has now started Grand Union to run open access services from London to Stirling and Carmarthen from next year. He said: “It has opened up the market. We were amazed by how many people couldn’t afford to travel by train when we started. Ask the leaders of councils in Hartlepool, Bradford or Halifax if they’d be without us. There is a huge amount of support at grassroots level.” That was underlined when, on the day Labour announced its rail nationalisation plan, state-run LNER confirmed the end of its daily direct London-Sunderland service, citing low passenger numbers. Yeowart said: “When things become difficult it is the extremities that lose out. I think people on the east coast would be horrified if they lost their alternatives.” But critics doubt how much those destinations contribute to profits, with the Carmarthen service, say, perhaps taking fares from passengers travelling to already well-connected Swansea. Yeowart insisted open access operators brought more people from road and air to rail. While total UK passenger numbers are below 2019 levels, mainly as commuting has fallen, usage across all the east coast operators was up on pre-Covid levels, he said. “What’s it got that’s different? Competition. And a little competition keeps everyone honest.” Others have been encouraged to join: France’s Alstom is looking to set up a direct London-Wrexham service, which it hopes can better an ill-fated predecessor by using the jealously guarded west coast main line to offer shorter journey times. Andrew Haines, Network Rail’s chief executive, said: “Some open access has proven to be valuable. If you’re going to do more, you have to be honest about the true costs of running it. In some places the benefits will outweigh the costs; in others it needs quite close scrutiny. “As an ex-chair of Hull Trains, I’m a massive advocate where it works well… but we should be transparent about the downsides if it ends up eating up capacity inefficiently.” While high fares, rigid central control and strike disruption persist, open access operators appear to offer an attractive alternative to both government and opposition. However, Labour’s policy document suggests some scepticism: open access “will remain where it adds value and capacity to the rail network”, and future applications will be decided “on the basis of an updated framework and guidance issued by the secretary of state”. Until the whole of the Great British Railways vision becomes reality – with a “guiding mind” running a fully integrated, functioning system – it may remain unclear whether open access trains are a cure for, or a symptom of, Britain’s fragmented railway.",

        "title": "Europe must find a way to help fund the fight against Putin – for its own sake | Phillip Inman",
        "content": "Europe has plotted an elegant decline that suits the needs of its ageing population, and the Ukraine war cannot be allowed to interfere with that plan. That is how it seems when EU countries consider circumventing the financial rulebook to offer Ukraine what it needs to overcome waves of drones and break the deadlock on its eastern front. Leaders in Europe’s capitals, who understandably want to be left alone to tackle mundane, domestic tasks, find themselves confronted by a defining moment in post-second-world-war history. Britain – as much a part of Europe as it was in 1939 – stands with its continental neighbours at the same crossroads. In one direction is a path leading to the defeat of Vladimir Putin and, among other things, the restoration of peace, a return to stable food and energy prices, calmer financial markets and a possible improvement in living standards for millions of low- and middle-income families. In the other direction is a future in which Putin secures a large slice of Ukraine and plots his next move knowing that Europe, including Britain, has failed to fully grasp the nature of the threat he poses. Already, elections are being manipulated and rogue foreign powers supported, undermining efforts to bring settled peace agreements where disputes break out. For Europe, self-interest should be allied to the charitable urge to prevent Ukrainians from being rounded up and sent to the gulag in their hundreds of thousands. There is a fatalistic view that says Europe’s destiny lies in the hands of whoever is in the White House. And it is obviously true that Washington matters. Yet, together, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the UK have the firepower and resources to support Ukraine and help it re-establish pre-2014 borders. Germany, though, is confused about its role. When asked about the need to use Russian assets in European financial centres to fund the war, it says the postwar international order must be observed. It’s not alone in this view, but Berlin is at the heart of the debate about using an estimated $300bn of Russian central bank assets, much of them residing in Belgium’s Euroclear exchange, to pay for the war effort. A spokesperson for Berlin said: “The federal government’s actions are guided by the need for our support for Ukraine to be in line with the principles of international law. “Hence it is important that these principles of international law are adhered to in connection with sanctions as well. Otherwise, we will jeopardise our credibility, including in the global south.” Another defence is that a “register of damage” has been established to make Russia pay for the destruction of Ukraine when the war is over. This is sweet music to Putin’s ears. As Timothy Ash, the Chatham House expert, says: “Forget any thoughts one might have about recovery and reconstruction. Ukraine needs to win the war first, which means giving it the money to buy arms wherever it can get them.” Germany had “done everything within its legal powers to track down Russian state assets and those of sanctioned individuals and companies, limit their use and freeze them”, Berlin’s spokesperson added. Yet German exports continue to pour into Moscow via countries such as Armenia, handing Putin’s supporters the high-end cars they desire and the mechanical and electrical parts they need to produce or maintain consumer goods. Armenia rightly points out that the export of goods to Russia cannot be blocked “unless those goods are under sanctions and included in the common high priority [CHP] list”. Putting items on the CHP list is the EU’s job, and Germany could be doing more to make that happen. More broadly, there is strong evidence that sanctions are strangling the Russian economy, but the slow pace means more needs to be done. Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says a legal way to use $300bn of Russian assets has already been established by experts; only a lack of will stands in the way. He says the west should go further, implementing a general prohibition on trade with Russia. “As with other sanctions regimes, exceptions may be carved out,” he says. “But the presumption should be that no western company helps a regime that threatens vital western security interests.” The exceptions, he says, could allow private Russian funds to find a home elsewhere in the world, in effect bleeding Moscow’s financial institutions dry. Without the means to pay China for its wares, Beijing’s helping hand would be withdrawn. The Ukraine war is not a side issue, demanding a few extra billion pounds from stretched finance ministries. It is a fundamental threat to European economies that politicians must address with greater urgency.",

        "title": "Capacity crunch: why the UK doesn’t have the power to solve the housing crisis",
        "content": "Oxford has a severe housing problem. With house prices 12 times the average salary, it has become one of the least affordable cities in the country. Its council house waiting list has grown to more than 3,000 households, with many having to live in temporary accommodation. An obvious solution is to build more homes, but those trying to do this face a big barrier: electricity. “When I talk to developers or potential developers, one of the first questions they now ask me is about grid capacity,” says Susan Brown, leader of Oxford city council. With housing developments competing for power against energy-hungry tech companies and the city’s increasingly electrified transport network, connection prospects are a matter of concern for housebuilders. “The problem [for developers] is securing sufficient energy, and the time it takes to connect to the grid,” Brown says. The council estimates that 26,000 new homes will be needed in and around the city by 2040, but it fears any building plans could be delayed by capacity constraints. In the nearby market town of Bicester, this has already happened. “The latest expansion in Bicester was supposed to see an additional 7,000 homes and a large commercial zone built, but they’ve been put on pause because grid reinforcements are needed to get them further,” says Brown, who is also a vice-chair of the District Councils’ Network, a cross-party group of 169 district and unitary councils in England. “I don’t think Oxfordshire is unique at all. I know it is becoming quite a big issue across the country.” This inability to build enough homes is not a new problem. For the past decade, sluggish building rates have meant the government’s target of 300,000 homes a year has been repeatedly missed, while the housing crisis has worsened. Funding and planning issues are routinely blamed for the country’s supply issues; a lack of electricity supply has rarely been given as a reason why homes are not built – until recently. “Securing capacity has always been a priority, but over the past 18 months, it has become a significant roadblock and a real challenge for developers across the country,” says Vicki Spiers, chair of the Independent Networks Association, whose members are responsible for connecting 80% of new UK homes to the grid. And as households move away from using fossil fuels to heat homes and power cars, the challenge will only grow. “We can see examples of developments being knocked back because of grid capacity,” says energy expert Adam Bell of Stonehaven Consulting. “That problem will only get worse in the future without expansion of the distribution network.” Just like the capacity issues facing housing developments, the country’s electricity system is complex, and growing more so. National Grid is responsible for the transmission network, which acts as a motorway transporting electricity from power sources to other parts of the country along high-voltage lines. After this come 14 distribution network operators (DNOs), the equivalent of A-roads, all responsible for distribution within a region. These connect either directly to housing developments or, more often, through independent network operators. In a country where electricity use is expected to increase by 50% by 2035, as millions of electric cars and domestic heat pumps are plugged in, the transmission network will require significant upgrades, at a cost of tens of billions of pounds. But it is at the distribution level, the A-roads, that the biggest roadblocks come for housing developments. The operators are often left waiting for major National Grid transmission upgrades to provide extra capacity to their network, but the five-year funding cycles set by regulator Ofgem mean local upgrade plans can become outdated as demand changes. Bell says: “These [cycles] made sense in a slow-paced world where demand grew through economic growth and population growth, but now that we are electrifying stuff, more data centres are coming online and the view taken five years ago is going to be wrong.” Even when upgrades or new connections are agreed on, completion can take years. Spiers says this is forcing more and more developers to mothball building projects. The Observer has spoken to several developers who have had to scale down, change or scrap plans because of electricity capacity issues. One developer was forced to shrink a development of more than 80 homes to fewer than 20 because it could not secure enough electricity. Another said capacity limitations meant it had had to cut the number of electric car chargers on a site. In an extreme example, one building firm scrapped a planned development of almost 100 homes after a £570,000 charge to secure a new connection made the scheme unviable. The most high-profile example of electricity shortages causing housing delays is in the west London boroughs of Hounslow, Hillingdon and Ealing. The area has become popular over recent years with data centre developers, thanks to the fibre optic cables that run along the M4 corridor to the Atlantic. Crucially, for an area with a large housing shortage, they have sucked up capacity that could have been used for vital housing schemes. In 2022, the Greater London Authority sounded the alarm over the power shortages, warning that all developments in the area could be paused until 2035, when new transmission connections would be constructed. Building of new infrastructure has now restarted and the National Grid and Scottish and Southern Electricity Network (SSEN) have come up with solutions to flatten out demand. These have included accelerating smaller housing developments, and striking deals with developers to build developments in phases to better match the extra capacity added to the network. But while progress has been made and 7,800 homes are now connected, 3,900 planned units, including 1,855 affordable homes, are still waiting to secure a power supply. Situations like the one in west London will become more common as the government’s Future Homes Standard legislation turbocharges the electrification of homes. The new law, which will come into force next year, will reduce the maximum permitted carbon emissions of all new homes by 75%-80%. David Adams, strategic adviser at the Future Homes Hub (which was set up to develop a long-term delivery plan for the sector) says this will effectively ban the use of fossil fuels in homes, and make electric heat pumps the only option. According to the National Grid electricity system operator (ESO), the body that ensures supply meets demand on the network, heat pumps will require 80 terawatt hours a year by 2050, if the country is to hit its decarbonisation goal. This is four times the current usage, but achieving this could be hampered by capacity constraints. Last year, Reading borough council raised concerns that its net zero housing ambitions could be curtailed because of SSEN restrictions on new connections. On a planned development of more than 220 homes with heat pumps, nearly two-thirds converted back to gas after capacity concerns were raised. “We had a developer that was willing to fit air source heat pumps, fit electric car chargers, but couldn’t get the capacity, and had to come back to planning so it could fit gas boilers,” says Micky Leng, the council’s planning lead. “This is a massive issue that has the potential to put the country’s race to net zero at risk.” The Energy Network Association, the body that represents district network operators, says connection issues are rare for housing projects, but where they do occur operators are working to find solutions. It adds that in most cases connections usually take a little over a year from a request being made, and that the past year has seen its members deliver enough additional capacity to power a million homes. But the Home Builders Federation says this is becoming a bigger issue for its members, and will only get worse. A spokesperson says: “Moving away from gas for heating will increase electricity usage and we have seen elsewhere that if there isn’t the grid capacity, the answer is to not allow any new housing.” Upgrading infrastructure at both National Grid and the distribution network will be key to this. Adams at the Future Home Hub suggests that smart energy technologies could provide a solution by using existing capacity more efficiently, and that installing batteries in housing schemes could also help. DNOs are also increasing adopting “flexibility models”, in which they buy excess energy from local generators of power, for example homes or businesses with solar panels, to increase grid supply. For Brown, the solutions for Oxfordshire can’t come soon enough. She says: “What concerns me is that it is delaying housing, making it more expensive, and it is affecting our ability to make housing zero carbon, which is so important.”",

        "title": "Should the Bank of England cut interest rates with Britain’s economy in bloom?",
        "content": "It would come as a shock to most economists if the Bank of England opted to cut interest rates at its policy meeting this week. Financial markets, which were baying for a cut last May, are these days betting that August or possibly September will be the point at which the Bank starts to lower interest rates from their current level of 5.25%. The reason for the delay can be found in the UK’s improving economy, which some on the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) believe could trigger the return of inflation later in the year. Higher shop prices would be embarrassing if victory in the fight against inflation had already been declared. Would the central bank have to raise interest rates again if that happened? Inside the Grade I-listed Threadneedle Street edifice that houses the Bank of England’s headquarters, a U-turn is considered unconscionable. And if the economy can grow when interest rates stand at 5.25%, why hurry to bring down the cost of borrowing? In an election year, the government might feel more of a sense of urgency about a reduction. After the historic swing against the Conservatives in the Blackpool South byelection and the loss of many council seats, a return to some kind of normal economic progress is considered by many ministers to be their best hope in the battle with Labour. With inflation forecast to fall below the 2% target as early as next month, pressure on the Bank to cut rates, and by more than once this year, is likely to intensify as Tory frustration grows. The independent Bank will be more focused, however, on the dismay among businesses and mortgage-payers needing to refinance their loans. If consumer and business confidence, which has improved in recent months, goes into reverse, the economy will suffer and dramatic cuts in interest rates will be needed to spur a revival. How robustly the UK has recovered from its recession last year will be revealed by the Office for National Statistics when figures covering the economy’s performance over the first three months of this year are published on Friday. The ONS is expected to say the economy grew by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024, after shrinking by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2023 and by 0.1% in the quarter before that. A bounce-back in consumer spending, driven by higher wages, is expected to be offset by poor trade figures and the general lack of momentum that led to the economy shrinking in the second half of 2023. Taken together, the likelihood is that growth will struggle to achieve a quickening pace this year. Among the forecasters, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is gloomy about the UK economy, downgrading growth forecasts for 2024 to 0.4% from 0.7% and predicting the UK will be the slowest-growing G7 economy in 2025. At the more optimistic end of the spectrum, the government’s independent forecasting unit, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has pencilled in growth of 0.8%. Neither estimates measures up to the 2.6% rise in GDP that the OECD expects in the US this year. That forecast explains why the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, signalled last week that it could be some time before the US’s central bank sanctioned an interest rate cut. Those who worry about the money supply, including Prof Costas Milas at the University of Liverpool management school, argue that high interest rates and tight government spending could tip the UK back into recession. It is unclear what strategy the Bank intends to follow. On the one hand, its governor, Andrew Bailey, says it should not simply follow the Fed, indicating early rate cuts are possible. On the other, several members of the MPC have talked tough, arguing that even if GDP is increasing only modestly, that still does not warrant a rate cut when there is a lack of skilled workers in many important sectors of the economy. Worker shortages could be the impulse for higher wages throughout the year, and that could, they say, spark the return of the inflation that the Bank fears.",

        "title": "VW owners claim ‘poor design’ left cars open to parts theft costing £1,600",
        "content": "Volkswagen owners targeted by thieves who have stolen cruise control sensors from cars across London are furious after discovering the car’s “poor design” that makes them so easy to steal is set to cost them £1,600 each. The sensors, which cost about £700 each, are fitted behind the VW badge, and appear to be a popular target for thieves. A VW specialist in the Midlands said he had experienced a big jump in sensor thefts “in the last few months”, and in recent weeks, motorists across the capital have been reporting thefts on social media groups. Tara O’Driscoll, from Clapham in south-west London, said she had fallen victim to the crime and had heard of more than 50 other reports of thefts in the borough since posting on social media about her experience. On some London roads, owners have reported that every VW car that features the sensor has had it taken. She has been told it will cost about £1,600 to replace the sensor on what she described as her “very ordinary” VW Golf. “Every VW car in our area that has this sensor has been targeted and it has been the talk of the community on WhatsApp and other media, not least as the bills to fix it are so big. It seems the part itself is expensive and only VW can calibrate it to work with your car,” she said. “People face having to make expensive insurance claims which will only push up their premiums for years to come, or pay the £1,600 upfront.” The part is vital to the car’s adaptive cruise control (ACC) as it measures the distance to the vehicle in front, and adjusts the driving speed accordingly. However, it is easily accessible and is held in place by three screws. VW owners first began reporting the theft of ACC sensors in 2016, and some have been hit by a second theft after the first was replaced. Owners are questioning why VW has not fixed this known problem. They now want VW to come up with a cost-effective solution – and an improved design to stop it happening again. The company has, so far, refused. O’Driscoll said: “Given that it is clearly such a poor design, we feel that VW should be making a contribution – or at least doing the work at cost. If we have the work done, what’s to stop it being stolen again the next week?” Rebecca Phillips, another Clapham resident whose VW Passat was similarly targeted recently, said she was furious that the manufacturer was not offering a cheaper solution. “When we searched online, it soon became clear this has been happening for years,” she said. “There are videos showing how easy it is to steal these sensors, and yet nothing has been done. Our car is now beeping safety warnings at us and VW has told us not to drive it until it is repaired.” A VW spokesperson said: “We are sorry to hear about the issues being faced by this group of customers and we have advised them that this is, first and foremost, a matter all victims should discuss with local police. This does appear to be a localised crime issue and we are not aware of similar incidents happening elsewhere in the country.” The company said it does not believe that this problem can be attributed to a design flaw or defect, and therefore it will not be offering any financial help to the owners. It said that a missing radar sensor would not result in an MOT failure, as owners have feared. “As this part is chassis-stamped, it can, once reported to us via the police, be locked so that it is inoperable on another vehicle – and as a result worthless on the black market,” the spokesperson said. The VW sensors are the latest expensive car parts to be targeted by thieves. There have previously been similar spates of Land Rover headlight and hybrid car catalytic converter thefts. • The caption to the second image in this article was amended on 6 May 2024; it shows Rebecca Phillips with her VW Passat, not Tara O’Driscoll with her VW Golf as an earlier version said.",

        "title": "Geopolitical tensions and Covid crisis: tightrope walk on China and Trump facing new HSBC boss",
        "content": "HSBC’s chief executive, Noel Quinn, is seen by many as ending his five-year tenure on a high note. The 62-year-old stunned the banking world this week by saying he planned to retire after an “intense” five years in the role to get a better work-life balance. Quinn has slimmed down a sprawling global bank, paid out $19bn (£15bn) to shareholders last year and successfully staved off calls to break up the lender. But Quinn’s fans were clearly not in attendance at HSBC’s annual meeting in London on Friday, where angry pensioners heckled bosses for clawing back their retirement payments and campaigners pushed bosses on climate commitments. On the sidelines, shareholders such as Geoff Gaskin said that Quinn had “done well as far as the dividend is concerned”, while another conceded that HSBC “couldn’t make money by acting on principles alone”. Their hopes for Quinn’s successor? Perhaps a more dynamic leader to take his place. “He’s no Jamie Dimon,” another shareholder of 20 years, John Threlfall, said of Birmingham-born Quinn. But HSBC is no JP Morgan. And if there is one thing that bankers and investors can agree on, it is that helming a bank such as HSBC is not for the faint of heart. Headquartered in London, but making the bulk of its profits in China, the 159-year-old bank has always had to tread a fine political line between east and west. That tightrope walk will get exponentially harder if Donald Trump returns to the White House and imposes new sanctions on China. It will need to be someone who possesses “a really, deep emotional intelligence … someone who understands the reality of managing geopolitical risks, while still coming back to its core: someone who understands how a bank works,” one former adviser to HSBC bosses said. They will also have to be a seasoned crisis manager such as Quinn, who launched his career at the UK’s Midland Bank, before its takeover by HSBC in 1992. “Starting off your career at a tough time means that when you get into a cycle of complexity in business … those formative experiences help you have discipline and an understanding of how things work,” they said. It helped Quinn win over a tough chairman, his board, as well as the respect of staff. Having worked as a commercial banker, colleagues say he truly understood relationship banking and cross-border finance, key functions for a bank such as HSBC. In August 2019, after more than three decades at the bank, the father of three was thrown into the chief executive role, initially on an interim basis, after the surprise departure of John Flint. His predecessor resigned just 18 months into the job amid tense disagreements with chairman Mark Tucker. It put Quinn in a challenging position: parachuted in to lead one of the world’s largest lenders under a chairman whose tough and domineering reputation preceded him, while knowing he was not Tucker’s first choice for the permanent job. One banker, for example, recounts a story of colleagues entering a meeting room to find Tucker – a former trainee professional footballer – holding someone in what appeared to be a friendly headlock. Chief financial officer Ewan Stevenson also quit in 2022, when it was made clear that Tucker did not see him taking the top job anytime soon. Tucker was at pains to state that Quinn’s exit is amicable, saying the “only point of difference” between them was their respective football club allegiances. But a source said Quinn’s departure was at odds with his recent message to staff that he would stay for a few more years, and pointed to boardroom tension around HSBC’s results in February, when profits and shares plunged on a $3bn write down in China. Tucker was the first outsider to chair HSBC, having previously led Asia-focused insurer Prudential in the late 2000s. Some suggest the gruff approach was Tucker’s way of getting a handle on a bank that for years picked its leaders internally, with entrenched internal hierarchies and bureaucracies. Tucker quickly got his way, persuading Quinn into an ambitious cost-cutting agenda involving about 35,000 job losses – something that Flint is rumoured to have opposed. Meanwhile, Quinn was forced to navigate growing geopolitical tension, just as Beijing started to tighten its grip on Hong Kong. Matters escalated when HSBC bosses controversially accepted China’s authoritarian crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong in 2020. Quinn was soon expertly dodging questions from US and British politicians over HSBC’s willingness to work with an increasingly authoritarian Beijing. Critics say Quinn was “diplomatic to the point of being ineffectual, trying to please everyone while pleasing nobody,” said Andrew Harper, chief responsibility officer of HSBC investor Epworth Investment, which holds £7.7m in shares. By then, the Covid pandemic was in full swing, stifling dealmaking and pushing interest rates to record lows. UK regulators forced HSBC to cancel dividends, infuriating Asian investors. It prompted calls from HSBC’s top investor Ping An to break up the business and spin off its more profitable Asian operations to boost returns to shareholders. HSBC resisted, but Quinn got to work: accelerating a pivot towards Asia while selling off less profitable retail operations in western countries such as France and the US. Quinn and Tucker eventually won the war with Ping An, but split opinion along the way. One senior banker, who has worked closely with HSBC bosses, said pulling bank capital out of western democracies and into China was one “obvious misstep”. “It’s not just the Hong Kong crackdown. It’s the way [Chinese president] Xi [JinPing] is becoming increasingly authoritarian in terms of the domestic economy in China, and continues to demonstrate that if you put capital in China, it’s not really yours.” Meanwhile, Quinn’s sold the US and French retail bank before interest rates spiked. He “got the least possible value, and sold at the absolute bottom. This is why the share price is below where it was when Tucker took over as chair seven years ago,” they said. HSBC shares were trading around 706p on Friday, down from 737p when Tucker joined in October 2017. “It’ll be fascinating to see who they get next. It’s one of the most consequential jobs, and definitely not the easiest,” one former adviser said. But with Tucker’s time running out as chair, he will want someone willing to take directions, but also step up when he departs. The finance chief, Georges Elhedery, and Nuno Matos, the head of the wealth management operation, are viewed as leading contenders. Former HSBC executives, including Lloyds Banking Group boss Charlie Nunn and BlackRock vice-chairman Mark McCombe, have also been named as potential runners. “He’ll want someone who’s willing to be the ‘number two’ executive in the institution,” a senior banker said. “I suspect he’ll also be yearning for a star banker, but I’m not sure you’re going to get the combination of the two.”",

        "title": "Mining industry braces for multi-billion pound Anglo American bidding war",
        "content": "The global mining industry is braced for a multi-billion pound bidding war for Anglo American amid growing speculation that mining companies are preparing rival bids. The Australian miner BHP is understood to have sent senior executives to Anglo’s base in South Africa to meet key company stakeholders after an initial offer of £31bn was rebuffed by Anglo’s board last week. A revised bid from BHP is expected to face competition from Swiss mining company Glencore, which is understood to be considering its own approach. Meanwhile, the British-Australian miner Rio Tinto has also been linked to the multi-billion pound tug-of-war over Anglo’s vast reserves of copper, a key building block of low-carbon technologies including solar farms and electric vehicles. The market speculation prompted a 3% jump in Anglo’s share price on Friday, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100 and helping to drive the index to an all-time high of 8,215 points. Anglo’s share price rise gives the miner a market valuation of about £37bn, well above the proposed takeover price offered by the Australian miner BHP, which was rejected by Anglo’s board last week as an “opportunistic” and “unattractive” offer. Industry analysts at Jefferies said this week that they expected BHP to return to the bargaining table with a “sweetened offer” but added that they “would be surprised if other bidders didn’t emerge”. One industry source said: “Glencore is definitely looking at an Anglo bid. There is no doubt that banks are already advising on what structure and price might make sense for them. I really can’t see them not doing anything.” A spokesperson for Glencore said the company did not comment on “market rumour or speculation”. The source added that Anglo was also likely to attract interest from Rio Tinto, which could set the stage for a three-way bidding war for the 107-year-old company. “This has a long way to run,” the source said. “It will take some time.” The Rio chair Dominic Barton remained tight-lipped on whether the company was considering making a play for Anglo when questioned during the company’s annual general meeting in Brisbane on Thursday. “Our policy is that we don’t speculate or comment on M&amp;A activity. So that would be my comment,” Barton said. The Anglo chair, Stuart Chambers, was also constrained from commenting directly on the takeover speculation at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. But he signalled that the board expected further offers for the company. “It’s the shareholders who will decide whether they believe the offer should be accepted or not,” he told the AGM in London. “The board doesn’t buy or sell the company – the shareholders decide.”. Chambers said he would be meeting with Anglo’s largest shareholders “and listening very carefully” to “hear what they feel” about the future of the company. Glencore and Rio could prove to be a better fit for Anglo than BHP, which made clear in its approach that the takeover would require Anglo to spin off some of its South African businesses, including the Kumba iron ore mine and Anglo’s platinum business, Amplats. The BHP approach received a frosty reception in South Africa, which is Anglo’s largest shareholder through its Public Investment Corporation and home to many of its mines. Christopher LaFemina, an analyst at Jefferies, said last week: “Unlike BHP, Glencore could benefit from keeping Kumba and marketing iron ore, and Glencore may face less political pushback in South Africa, especially if it were to propose a straightforward all-share deal that does not include Kumba and Amplats demergers.” Rio was approached for comment. Anglo declined to comment.",

        "title": "Interest rate cut bets rise as US job creation slows; FTSE 100 at record high – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to recap… Hiring in the US slowed in April with the workforce adding another 175,000 jobs and wage growth slowing. The news cheered investors hoping that a cooling labor market will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – which have been driven to a 20-year high as the US fights stubbornly high inflation. All the major US markets rose in early trading. Last month, the labor department reported the US added a revised 315,000 jobs in March, far higher than the 192,000 jobs economists had forecast. April’s figure was lower than forecast and the unemployment rate ticked up from 3.8% to 3.9% over the month but the figures underlined the continuing strength of the jobs market. It was the 40th straight month of job gains in the US and the 27th consecutive month with the unemployment rate below 4% – the longest such streak since 1953. But the slowdown in job creation is fuelling expectations that US interest rates could be cut sooner than expected, with a September cut looking more likely. Here’s the full story: With stock markets rallying across Europe and in the US, the UK’s FTSE 100 share index is on track for a new closing high tonight. With less than an hour’s trading to go, the Footsie is up 41 poinst at 8212, having surged over 8,200 points for the first time today. Here’s the rest of today’s stories so far: Back in London, HSBC shareholders have rejected the resolution to scrap the pension clawback which has cost its retired workers thousands of pounds per year. As we covered earlier, the Midland Clawback Campaign argues that HSBC is acting unfairly by cutting their company pension on the grounds that they also receive the state pension. Resolution 17 said: This Special Resolution seeks shareholders to instruct the board to align pension inequality with their commitment to reduce the gender pay gap, by removing the impact of State Deduction from the members of the post 1974 Midland Section of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme. HSBC had advised investors to vote against this resolution, and they heeded this advice, with just 4% of votes cast in favour. A motion to allow HSBC to remove its cap on bankers bonuses was passed with 99% support… Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman has slightly dampened the mood in the markets, by predicting that US inflation will likely remain elevated for “some time”. In remarks prepared for the Massachusetts Bankers Association Annual Convention in Key Biscayne, Florida, Bowman says: “I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time. “My baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook.” The latest US jobs data has further fueled expectations of impending interest rate cuts and paints a picture of a soft landing on the economic horizon, says Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. But if today’s report is revised lower in a month’s time, there be more concerns over the health of the US conomy. Innes says: According to the BLS release on Friday, the US economy added 175,000 jobs in April, a figure that could be deemed within the “Goldilocks zone.” Leading up to the release, there was a subtle and odd uptick in the “whisper” number, consequently, the 175,000 figure was perceived as a wider miss compared to the “official” consensus set at 240,000. Of particular encouragement for the Federal Reserve was the subdued reading of Average Hourly Earnings (AHE). AHE increased by only 0.2% from March (0.2019% when unrounded), falling below consensus expectations. Similarly, the year-over-year (YoY) growth rate of 3.9% was cooler than anticipated. This data should help alleviate concerns about “stagflation” prompted by the headline nonfarm payrolls (NFP) miss, as well as ease worries exacerbated by the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and Unit Labor Costs (ULC) overshooting in the first quarter. While the extent of the headline miss might fuel concerns about a recession, for the time being, 175,000 represents a fundamentally robust pace of hiring. Any significant downward revisions next month alongside another substantial miss may warrant cause for concern. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, agrees that today’s weaker US jobs numbers boost expectations of a September rate cut. Knightley explains: Job creation was weaker, unemployment higher and wage growth more subdued than expected in the April employment report. With Fed Chair Powell leaning dovish at Wednesday’s press conference this has breathed new life into Federal Reserve interest rate cut calls Stocks have surged at the start of trading in New York, after traders learned that hiring across America slowed last month. News that the US non-farm payroll only rose by 175,000 in April, weaker than the average monthly gain of 242,000 over the last year, has driven investors into a frenzy of of stock buying. They are excited by the prospect that US interest rates may fall quicker than expected – and putting aside concerns that slowing job creation may show the economy is weakening. The Dow Jones industrial average, of 30 large US companies, has rallied by 1.4%, gaining 543 points at the open to 38,769 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 1.2%. And the tech-focused Nasdaq has surged by 1.9% (interest rate cuts being good for the share price of technology companies). City traders are also more confident that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this year. The money markets are now pricing in two quarter-point cuts by Christmas – previously, the second cut was not fully priced in. A cut in August is pretty-much priced in (although it could slip to September), with a second expected in November or December. Today’s jobs report has opened to door to a cut to US interest rates in September, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at brokerage XTB. She report that there has been “a huge movement in US interest rate expectations”, helped by the slowdown in job creation in April. There is now a 50% chance of a rate hike in September, up from 31% in April. Earlier this week there was only 1 rate cut priced in from the Fed for 2024, as we end the week, there are now nearly two cuts priced in. Overall, risk sentiment has been given a boost this week from a less hawkish Fed and payrolls data that is moving in the direction needed for interest rate cuts in the US. The combination of payrolls and the Fed have helped to increase rate cut expectations for 2024, with no chance of a rate hike for this year expected. What a difference a week makes. Today’s US employment report shows a ‘historic jobs market’, says Heather Long of the Washington Post, who cites the low unemployment rate (which rose to 3.9% in April, from 3.8%). America’s health care system was responsible for almost one in three of the new jobs created in April. Health care added 56,000 jobs in April, today’s repost shows, out of 175,000 new additions to the Non-Farm Payroll. Employment in social assistance increased by 31,000 in April, while transportation and warehousing added 22,000 jobs, and retailers made 20,000 new hires. While weakening jobs growth may mean lower interest rates soon, it may also signal that the US economy is weakening. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, says: “This is the jobs report the Fed would have scripted. The first downside payrolls surprise in several months, as well as the dip in average hourly earnings growth, will bring the rate cutting dialogue back into the market and perhaps explains why Powell was able to be dovish on Wednesday. Of course, today’s weaker numbers need to mark the start of a new slower trend for multiple rate cuts to seriously be back on the agenda - but, by then, the new fear could be a slowing economy.” Reaction to the slowdown in US job creation is flooding in. Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: “Investors will interpret today’s weak jobs report as a sign that demand is slowing in the labour market. Both markets and central bankers have been looking for evidence that disinflation may be ahead, and today’s figures could indicate that the economy is slowing down. In recent months, it has become clear that the Fed is happy to move slowly in the cutting part of the rate cycle, but unwanted and unexpected weakness in the economy, as we are seeing today, may cause a shift in this approach. A dive in the labour market may be what it takes to push the Fed from a stroll to a sprint.” Mahmoud Alkudsi, senior market analyst at ADSS, says: “This is a rare miss for the US jobs market which could potentially spell the end of the ‘higher for longer’ rhetoric we have become accustomed to. This will have surprised the Fed following Wednesday’s decision to hold interest rates further.” “Though the Fed will see this as a step towards getting comfortable with a cut in interest rates, the relative strength of the jobs market remains too high for them to consider a cut before late Q2.” And here’s Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors: “What will the Fed make of this? At last there is evidence of some weakness in the US jobs market. Rate cuts will move back up the agenda as a result and there is little doubt that markets will take this as good news. While we shouldn’t make too much of single data prints, this could be the start of a positive trend for the Fed.” Wage growth across America has slowed – a blow to workers, but just what central bankers want to see. Average hourly earnings growth slowed to +0.2% in April, down from 0.3% in March. On an annual basis, earnings rose by 3.9%, down from 4%. That means real wages (adjusted for inflation) are still rising (as US inflation was 3.5% in March). In London, the FTSE 100 share index has jumped to a new alltime high. The blue-chip share index has rocketed to 8248 points, a new intraday high, mirroring the jump in Wall Street futures. Ocado, the grocery technology business, is up 7%. Takeover speculation continues to push up Anglo American by over 3% too. The dollar has tumbled by a cent against the pound, as April’s weak jobs report fuels hopes of an early cut to US interest rates. Sterling has jumped to $1.2624, the highest in over three weeks, up from $1.2531 last night. Newsflash: job creation across the US economy has slowed, news that has weakened the US dollar and driven up share prices. April’s non-farm payroll shows that US employment increased by 175,000 in April, less than the 243,000 expected. That’s a sharp slowdown on March, when an upwardly revised 315,000 jobs were created, while February’s NFP was revised down from +270,000 to +236,000. The report says that job gains occurred in health care, in social assistance, and in transportation and warehousing. The US unemployment rate has risen to 3.9%, from 3.8%. The report has knocked the dollar, while shares are higher in pre-market trading in New York. Here’s Simon French, chief economist at City bank Panmure Gordon, on today’s disappointing public sector productivity stats (see 10.20am): Here’s more details of the shareholder criticism at HSBC’s AGM: Another HSBC shareholder qustions how the bank can claim staff were fully aware of the pensions clawback issue. Q: If that was true, why are there 10,000 people in a Facebook campaign group? And was CEO Noel Quinn fully informed when he was a Midland Bank staff member? Quinn says he was “well aware” of clawback – a reply that is greeted by hoots of derision from the floor of the AGM. HSBC are hearing the anger of former employees who argue the bank is simply wrong to have clawed back part of their pensions. The Midland Clawback Campaign group have proposed a resolution at today’s AGM to end the practice, and are unhappy that chair Mark Tucker is advising shareholders to oppose it. The clawback was introduced in the 1940s and allows workers to pay lower contributions into their occupational pension plans, and for employers to deduct some - or all - of the basic state pension amount from their pension payments. One campaigner, Nancy Ball, tells the AGM of examples of HSBC pensioners who have lost over 20% of their pensions due to the clawback. In contrast, she points out, CEO Noel Quinn’s pay almost doubled last year. Quinn, who announced his retirement this week, should reflect on whether he could, and should, have supported his Midland Bank colleagues in their retirement [Midland was taken over by HSBC in 1992]. Ball also points to the irony that HSBC is refusing to end the clawback, while also asking shareholders to remove the cap on its bankers’ bonuses. Ball insists that it is “balderdash” to say that the clawback was clearly explained to staff, calling the situation “a shambles”. Chairman Mark Tucker tells the AGM that the clawback was lawful, not discriminationary, and was properly communicated. Midland Clawback Campaigners don’t agree, and shout back at Tucker from the floor. The Clawback campaign explain here that the policy is unfair because pensioners lose the same monetary amount, regardless on whether they’re on a large or small pension. The chair of HSBC has predicted that the Bank of England will cut interest rates in June, for the first time since early in the pandemic in 2020. Speaking at HSBC’s annual general meeting in London today, Mark Tucker explains that inflation data is “key” to the global interest rate outlook. He predicts that the BoE will lower interest rates by one and a half percentage points by the end of next year. That would lower Bank Rate to 3.75%, from 5.25% today. Tucker says: Central banks are closely and carefully watching the data and need to be confident that inflation will continue to head down to target on a sustainable basis before lowering rates. Our economists continue to anticipate a gradual reduction in inflation with our global inflation forecasts at 5.8% in 2024 and 3.8% in 2025. We expect the ECB and Bank of England to cut rates in June, cutting by 150bps by year-end 2025. We expect the Fed to cut in September, cutting by 100bps by year-end 2025. The City money markets do not expect the BoE to cut as early as June, though – today, the first cut is only fully priced in for September, although there’s a 66% chance it could come in August. Tucker adds that it is hard to achieve “relative certainty in the central banks’ decision-making process”, given that both growth and employment numbers are holding up and inflationary pressures are lingering. As he puts it: It may not be a steady path. New experimental statistics show that UK public sector productivity dropped in the final quarter of last year, and is almost 7% below its pre-pandemic levels. The Offiec for National Statistics has reported that public service productivity fell by 1% in October-December 2023 compared with July-September, the third quarterly decline in a row. This left public sector productivity 2.3% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2022. Annual estimates suggest that public service productivity showed no growth (0.0%) in 2023, following a partial “bounce-back” of 6.5% in 2021 and 3.0% in 2022 following the pandemic in 2020, the ONS reports. Productivity rises if output increases faster than inputs, and vice versa. The ONS reports that inputs (such as wages) rose by 1.2% in the quarter, while output only rise by 0.1% Inputs increased on the quarter for all service areas, however, output fell for healthcare and education, the two largest areas by expenditure share, the ONS adds. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, says the “huge drop” in productivity since the pandemic is “pretty worrying”, and shows public services are struggling. Over in Oslo, Norway’s central bank has left interest rates unchanged. The Norges Bank decided to maintain its policy rate at 4.5%, and predicted that rates will “likely be kept at that level for some time ahead”. Newsflash: The UK’s services sector has posted the fastest business activity growth in almost a year, reinforcing hopes that the recession is over. Data firm S&amp;P Global has reported that its UK Services PMI, which tracks activity in the sector, has jumped to 55.0 in April, up from 53.1 in March. That’s the highest reading since May 2023, and shows growth accelerated in a sector that makes up around three-quarters of the UK economy. Services firms reported that activity and new work rose at the fastest rates for 11 months, with reports that optimism about the economic recovery boosted companies. However, staff hiring remained subdued, with some companies reporting difficulties finding suitable candidates to fill vacancies. Others cited wage pressures, given last month’s near 10% annual rise in the National Living Wage. Input cost inflation was the highest since August 2023 Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, explains: “Service providers benefited from improving business and consumer spending in April as more favourable demand conditions underpinned the greatest improvement in activity since May 2023. The latest survey results are consistent with the UK economy growing at a quarterly rate of 0.4% and therefore pulling further out of last year’s shallow recession. “Relief at a turnaround in the economic outlook was commonly cited as a factor supporting sales pipelines in April. However, there were also reports that clients remained somewhat risk averse and under pressure from elevated inflation. Next Friday we will learn if the UK recession is over, when GDP data for the first three months of this year is released. Economists predict a return to growth in January-March, of around 0.4%. Today’s Services PMI suggests that the second quarter of the year got off to a good start too. Moore adds that business activity expectations for the year ahead were upbeat: Election uncertainty and fading prospects for interest rate cuts were cited as headwinds on the horizon, but survey respondents still mostly reported positive sentiment towards their business investment plans and longer-term growth opportunities.” Boom! Britain’s FTSE 100 share index has hit a new alltime high in early trading, as its rally continues. The Footsie has risen over 8,200 points for the first time, touching 8205 points, above Tuesday’s intraday high of 8199.95 points. This extends the FTSE 100’s recent rally, which has seen it gain 6% so far this year. And as covered earlier, analysts believe it has further to rise. Mining company Anglo American remains the top riser in London, up over 3% on bidding war hopes – after Reuters reported that Glencore was considering a takeover approach. The FTSE 100 has benefited this year from traders switching out of tech stocks and into commodities. Hopes of easing tensions in the Middle East also lifted stocks last month, as have signs that the UK economy is pulling out of recession. Global food prices inched up in April, due to rising meat prices and small increases in the cost of vegetable oils and cereals. The United Nations food agency’s world price index rose in April, for the second month in a row, to 119.1 points, up from 118.8 points in March. That still leaves prices 9.6% lower than a year ago, though. Cereal prices rose by 0.3%, amid concerns about unfavorable crop conditions in parts of the European Union, the Russian Federation and the United States of America. Vegetable oil prices rose by 0.3%, driven by costlier sunflower and rapeseed oil. Meat prices increased by 1.6% last month, with international poultry, bovine and ovine meat prices all rising. But there were some price falls too – among sugar and dairy products. Sugar prices fell by 4.4%, due to larger-than-previously-anticipated outputs in India and Thailand and improved weather conditions in Brazil. Dairy prices dipped by 0.3%, ending six consecutive months of increases. This was due to “sluggish spot import demand for skim milk powder”, and lower world cheese prices. Butter prices rose, though. UK supermarket chain Asda has successfully refinanced over £3bn of debt. Asda reports that it saw “strong demand from investors” for new debt sold yesterday, which has pushed out the majority of its maturities into the next decade. The sals, it says, included the biggest sterling high-yield bond this year and the second-largest sterling bond in the European leveraged finance market. Michael Gleeson, Asda’s chief financial officer, says: “The positive reaction followed Asda’s strong FY23 results – and Moody’s upgrade of its corporate rating to B1 from B2 last week citing a material reduction in leverage and growth in underlying free cashflow. The takeover of Asda by private equity firm TDR Capital and billionaire brothers Moshin and Zuber Issa added billions of pounds of debt to Asda – with refinancing costs jumping as interest rates have risen. The Evening Standard reports that Asda is now paying higher interest rates on its new debts, saying: The firm said it successfully raised £1.75 billion of senior secured notes and refinanced its £900 million Term Loan B. The Term Loan B was secured at a EURIBOR+4.25% interest rate, an increase on the previous loan of EURIBOR+2.75% Rail ticket platform Trainline are the top riser on the FTSE 250 after doubling its operating profits in the last year. Trainline reported that its operating profits rose by 101% in the year to 29th February, from £28m to £56m. Trainline, which says it is now Europe’s most downloaded rail app, grew its net ticket sales by 22% in the last year. And interestingly, the company tells shareholders that the Labour party have told Trainline that they have “no plans to revive the current Government’s previous proposal for a national retailing website and app”. Last December, Trainline’s share surged when the Department for Transport scrapped plans to create a Great British Railways ticketing website and app. With Labour pledging to fully nationalise the train network within five years of coming to power, there had been thoughts that the app plan could be revived. Trainline’s shares are up almost 7% this morning, as those fears are shunted aside. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, suggests the London stock market has further to climb: US markets may have lost some of their mojo but the same cannot be said for a flourishing FTSE100, where opening strength lifted gains in the year so far to 6%. The mixture of technical factors, such as rising commodity prices and higher interest rates underpinning the likes of the mining, oil and banking sectors has been combined with improving sentiment towards the premier index. Even at these elevated levels at or around record highs, the valuation of the index remains undemanding in comparison to many of its peers which could suggest that the recent rally still has some way to go. In the City, the blue-chip share index has nearly hit a new alltime high at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 index has jumped by 24 points, or 0.3%, to 8197 points – only slightly below the intraday high of 8199.95 points set on Tuesday. Anglo American is the top riser riser, up 3.3%, after Reuters reported last night that commodities group Glencore was studying an approach for Anglo. Such an approach could spark a bidding war for Anglo American, which rebuffed an approach from fellow miner BHP Group last month. Glencore is the top FTSE 100 faller, down 1.7%. The main highlight today will be the US jobs report for April, predicts Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank. He explains: This will be an important release for the Fed as well, since the resilience in the labour market has enabled them to keep the focus on inflation. Indeed, the March report showed nonfarm payrolls rise by a 10-month high of +303k, whilst the 3-month average growth was at a 12-month high of +276k. However, even as the nonfarm payrolls numbers have been strong, other indicators have pointed to growing weakness in the labour market, and this week’s JOLTS report for March showed that both job openings and the quits rate were down to their lowest in over three years. In terms of what to expect today, our US economists expect nonfarm payrolls growth to moderate to +240k in April, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 3.8% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The oil price is on track for its biggest weekly losses in three months, bringing relief to consumers and central bankers alike. Crude oil prices have fallen by over 6% so far this week, helped by easing tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty about demand for energy. That would be its worst week since the start of February. After hefty losses early this week, Brent crude is trading around its weakest level since mid-March, at below $84 per barrel, having ended last week near $90 per barrel. Hopes for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, and free the remaining hostages held there since the October 7 attacks, have risen this week. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told Israel and Hamas that “the time is now” for a deal, during his seventh visit to the Middle East since last October. A ceasefire, if agreed, would cut risks to oil supplies from the region. The oil price also weakened after US stocks of crude oil climbed unexpectedly this week. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that energy firms added a surprise 7.3 million barrels of crude into stockpiles during the week to April 26. The EIA also reported a surprise 0.3-million barrel build in gasoline inventories; analysts had expected gasoline stocks would decline by 1.1 million barrels. David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, says: Added together, the data show that the US market has plenty of supply, and crude prices fell to reflect this. Oil has also been hit by fading hopes for early cuts in US interest rates. Lower borrowing costs should boost oil demand, but that seems less likely given the stickiness of US inflation. Also coming up today Financial markets are bracing for the latest US Non-Farm Payroll – the monthly healthcheck on America’s jobs market, due at 1.30pm UK time. Economists expect a slowdown in job creation; the NFP is expected to rise by 238,000, down on the 303,000 gain in March. The jobless rate is tipped to remain at 3.8%. Attention will also focus on wage growth, which is expected to slow slightly to 4%, from 4.1% in March.

        "content": "Hiring in the US slowed in April with the workforce adding another 175,000 jobs and wage growth slowing. The news cheered investors hoping that a cooling labor market will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – which have been driven to a 20-year high as the US fights stubbornly high inflation. All the major US markets rose on the news. Last month, the labor department reported the US added a revised 315,000 jobs in March, far higher than the 192,000 jobs economists had forecast. April’s figure was lower than forecast and the unemployment rate ticked up from 3.8% to 3.9% over the month but the figures underlined the continuing strength of the jobs market. It was the 40th straight month of job gains in the US and the 27th consecutive month with the unemployment rate below 4% – the longest such streak since 1953. Gains were broad-based, with healthcare, social assistance, transportation and warehousing, manufacturing and construction all adding jobs. The growth in the jobs market has continued even as the Fed has maintained its rates policy. The Fed said this week that inflation remained high and that it did not plan to cut interest rates until it has “greater confidence” that price increases are slowing to the goal of 2%. Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said the slowdown in price increases was taking longer than expected, but that he expected inflation to “move back down” this year. Wage gains in April – which are also closely watched by the Fed – were also lower than forecast, increasing 3.9% from a year earlier after rising 4.1% in March. “Despite missing expectations, signaling an economic cooldown, the labor market has still maintained a pattern of growth and consumers can be cautiously optimistic that the Fed will be able to successfully lower inflation while also avoiding a recession,” said Steve Rick, chief economist at TruStage. ADP, the US’s largest payroll supplier, reported this week that private sector employment was up 192,000 jobs in the month of April and that annual pay was up 5% year-over-year. “Hiring was broad-based in April,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. “Only the information sector – telecommunications, media, and information technology – showed weakness, posting job losses and the smallest pace of pay gains since August 2021.”",

        "title": "Northumbrian Water told to publish raw sewage discharge data it tried to hide",
        "content": "A water company that tried to keep secret details of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of raw sewage discharges into the sea has been ordered by an appeal tribunal to release the data in the public interest. Northumbrian Water has repeatedly refused to release details about the scale of raw sewage discharges into the North Sea from an outflow at its pumping station in Whitburn, after a campaigner asked under freedom of information and environmental information regulations. Campaigners say the pollution has been going on for years, but the Environment Agency, Northumbrian Water and the government all dispute their findings. In 2012 the European court of justice ruled the sewage discharges at Whitburn put the UK in breach of its legal obligations to treat wastewater and gave the government five years to remedy the situation. Steve Lavelle, the vice-chair of the neighbourhood forum in Whitburn, south Tyneside, has been investigating the scale of raw sewage discharges in an attempt to show the pollution is continuing many years after the ECJ ruling. Lavelle said: “We need this information to show this pollution is still going on. We want the data to feed into our neighbourhood plan so that we can provide the details about the capacity of sewage treatment in the area when any future development is proposed. “At the moment they do not have the infrastructure in place to deal with the volume of sewage.” The Environment Agency permit for the plant states raw sewage discharges must only take place during intense rainfall or snowmelt. But data unearthed by Lavelle over many years has exposed what he says is sewage dumping outside periods of intense rainfall. In 2019 when the north-east of England received slightly above average rainfall of 750mm of rain, more than 760,000 tonnes of untreated sewage was discharged from Whitburn Steel pumping station directly into the North Sea, Environment Agency data obtained by Lavelle shows. In 2020, when rainfall was 610mm, within the annual average range, the long sea outfall discharged more than 460,000 tonnes of untreated sewage into the Northumbria Coast special protection area. A year later when rainfall was 660mm, the water company discharged a record high of 821,088 tonnes into the sea. Lavelle said these discharges contributed to the pollution in the North Sea at Marsden, where there is a beach designated as bathing water, and the pollution to the beaches and rock pools at Whitburn. To retrieve 2022 data, he asked the water company via environmental information regulations and FoI to provide a detailed description of all of the sewage discharge records, the times of discharges and the volumes of sewage discharges. The regulator Ofwat and the Environment Agency are investigating more than 2,000 treatment works across the water network for suspected illegal sewage dumping. The investigations, which are likely to report this year, could impose significant fines or lead to the prosecution of some companies. Citing the investigations as a reason, Northumbrian Water refused to release the 2022 data to Lavelle, saying to do so “would adversely affect the course of justice, the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature”. When Lavelle asked for an internal review, Northumbrian Water argued that to release the sewage data could cause adverse public opinion to influence the regulators as they carried out their investigation. The Information Commissioner’s Office, asked to examine Lavelle’s request, supported the water company and said it was in the public interest for the company to keep the information secret. But after an appeal to the first tier tribunal, the panel found in favour of Lavelle and told the water company it was not satisfied that releasing the information would affect the course of justice. The tribunal found it was in the public interest to release the information, and the water company had not adequately considered the need for transparency in its refusal to provide the information. “It has been like pulling teeth,” said Lavelle. “They are more intent on closing down my requests for information than being transparent and providing the information which is in the public interest.” Northumbrian Water said in a statement: “We are committed to protecting and enhancing coasts, rivers and watercourses in all areas of our operation and have proactively published a number of industry-leading pledges to generate further improvements. “We have a strong track record when it comes to the environment and have retained the excellent or good rating from the Environment Agency in each of the last three years. We note the tribunal court’s decision regarding the Whitburn pumping station and are considering our next steps.” The ruling came as seven water companies published near-real-time maps of their sewage discharges from combined sewer overflows, which was required under the Enviornment Act. Those companies are Dwr Cymru (Welsh Water), Yorkshire Water, Severn Trent, Northumbrian Water, Anglian Water, Wessex Water and United Utilities.",

        "content": "Joshua Dean, a Boeing whistleblower who warned of manufacturing defects in the planemaker’s 737 Max, has died after a short illness, the second Boeing whistleblower to die this year. Dean, 45, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) alleging “serious and gross misconduct by senior quality management of the 737 production line” at Spirit. In 2018 and 2019, two 737 Max planes were involved in fatal crashes, which killed 346 people. Dean was fired by Spirit last year, and filed a complaint with the Department of Labor alleging that his termination was in retaliation for raising safety concerns. According to the Seattle Times, Dean was hospitalized after having trouble breathing. He was intubated and developed pneumonia and a serious infection before dying two weeks later. “He passed away yesterday morning, and his absence will be deeply felt. We will always love you Josh,” Dean’s aunt, Carol Dean Parsons, said via Facebook. Dean was represented by the same law firm that represented Boeing whistleblower John “Mitch” Barnett. Barnett, 62, was found dead in March from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Barnett spent almost three decades at Boeing, and told the New York Times in 2019 that he had found “clusters or metal slivers” hanging over the wiring of flight controls that could have caused “catastrophic” damage if they had penetrated wires. He alleged that management had ignored his complaints and moved him to another part of the plant. Last month, another Boeing whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, told Congress there was “no safety culture” at Boeing, and alleged that employees who raised the alarm were “ignored, marginalized, threatened, sidelined and worse”. He said he feared “physical violence” after going public with his concerns. US regulators are now investigating Boeing after a mid-air door-panel blowout in January on a Boeing 737 Max 9. Reuters reported last month that the justice department is now weighing whether Boeing violated an agreement that shielded it from criminal prosecution over the fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.

        "content": "Paramount Global’s share price soared on Thursday following a report that Sony Pictures and Apollo Global Management had made a $26bn offer for the troubled media giant. According to the Wall Street Journal, the offer was made on Wednesday by Sony’s chief executive, Tony Vinciquerra, and Aaron Sobel, a partner at Apollo. Paramount’s shares rose 12% on the news. Paramount is home to some of the world’s biggest media assets including Paramount Pictures, CBS, MTV, the UK’S Channel 5 and Australia’s Channel Ten. The movie studio’s blockbuster hits include the Mission: Impossible franchise and The Godfather. But Paramount has struggled with the transition to streaming media and has been riven by internal power struggles. This week Bob Bakish, Paramount’s chief executive and one of the longest-serving media bosses in the US, was ousted amid reports that he had clashed with Shari Redstone, Paramount’s current controlling shareholder, over her plans to sell the company. Paramount has been considering a merger with Skydance Media, a production company led by David Ellison, the producer and son of Larry Ellison, the billionaire tech tycoon. Skydance has backed Paramount movies such as Top Gun: Maverick, but the deal has reportedly infuriated some shareholders who have argued it short-changes shareholders and is too generous to Redstone. Skydance has now increased the amount of money that could go toward Paramount’s balance sheet to $3bn, from $1.5bn. A combination of two of the most famous studios in Hollywood would attract the attention of the Biden administration which has recently displayed a more aggressive stance to big corporate mergers. Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan has sued to block several high-profile mergers, including Kroger’s $24.6bn takeover of rival grocer Albertsons, and Nvidia’s $40bn takeover of the chip designer Arm Holdings, a bid that was later abandoned.",

        "title": "Gazprom slumps to first annual loss in 22 years as trade with Europe hit",
        "content": "The Kremlin-owned gas company Gazprom has plunged to its first annual loss in more than 20 years, after gas sales more than halved following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The company made a net loss of 629bn roubles (£5.5bn) in 2023 amid dwindling gas trade with Europe, once Gazprom’s main sales market, as a result of sanctions and the throttling of pipelines to the continent. The results highlight the dramatic decline of the company, which since the collapse of the Soviet Union has been one of Russia’s most powerful, with its gas supplies often used as a leverage in disputes with neighbours such as Ukraine and Moldova. Analysts had expected net income of 447bn roubles, according to the Interfax news agency. According to analysis by Reuters, it was Gazprom’s first annual loss since the late 1990s/early 2000s, when Alexei Miller, an ally of the then newly installed President Putin, took over the company in 2001. Gazprom’s 2023 loss followed a net profit of 1.2tn roubles the previous year. The company, which is now headquartered in St Petersburg, made heavy losses in the late 1990s after it racked up foreign-currency debt, inflated in rouble terms by the financial crisis of 1998. Gazprom shares in Moscow were down about 4% on Thursday. Russia’s gas exports to Europe, once its primary export market, have slumped because of the political fallout from the conflict in Ukraine, while Gazprom, which has a monopoly on piping gas abroad, has been the most tangible victim of western sanctions. In mid-2022, Gazprom began throttling supplies of gas to Europe through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline, and that September announced it was indefinitely shutting down the conduit from Siberia into northern Germany via the Baltic Sea. The following month the pipeline was damaged by undersea explosions, the cause of which is still being looked into by German investigators. While the disruption pushed the whole gas price up to near-record highs, European countries had greater success than expected in finding alternative sources of supplies, with the US and Qatar helping to refill storage on the continent. Gazprom’s core profit, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), fell to 618.38bn roubles last year, down from 2.79tn roubles in 2022, according to Reuters’ calculations. Ronald Smith from the Moscow-based brokerage BCS Global Markets said: “The full-year Ebitda of $7.2bn was the worst in 22 years, since the company reported $7.6bn in 2002.” According to Reuters’ calculations, Gazprom’s natural gas supplies to Europe fell 55.6% to 28.3bn cubic metres (bcm) last year. Gazprom has not published its own export statistics since the start of 2023. • Reuters contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Goldman Sachs to scrap cap on bonuses for hundreds of UK staff",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs has told hundreds of its top UK bankers that it is eradicating a cap on bonuses, in a move that will allow its star performers to earn up to 25 times their annual salary. Richard Gnodde, chief executive of Goldman Sachs International, made the announcement during a video message to staff on Thursday. It comes months after UK regulators confirmed they were formally scrapping EU rules that previously limited bonuses to twice an individual’s base salary. UK lenders including HSBC, Barclays and NatWest are planning to follow suit. Gnodde said in the video that ending the UK cap would help level the playing field across its international workforce. “We are a global firm and to the extent possible we adopt a consistent global approach across everything we do. The bonus cap rules were an important factor preventing us from being consistent in the area of compensation.” He said Goldman had advocated for changes that would give banks the flexibility of weighting payouts more heavily towards bonuses rather than fixed salaries. The move gives lenders more control over staff pay, depending on performance. It will also be easier to defer pay, and potentially claw back bonuses from bankers when things go wrong. The changes will apply to hundreds of Goldman’s 6,000 UK staff – known as material risk takers – who will now be able to earn up to 25 times their salaries in bonuses. “Going forward, we will be aligning UK material risk takers’ compensation mix more closely with the firm’s global compensation principles – meaning lower fixed pay, but a higher proportion of discretionary compensation,” Gnodde said. “This also reflects the prudential objective of our regulators,” he added. The change will not apply to Goldman’s EU-based bankers, and unlike UK regulators, American watchdogs do not require any guidance on maximum payouts. The bonus cap was originally part of changes introduced after the 2007-08 banking crash, and aimed to stamp out a bonus culture blamed for encouraging short-term profits over longer-term stability. The hope was that, with less of an individual’s pay riding on performance, there would be a lower incentive for risky behaviour. However, they were opposed by some UK politicians as well as the Bank of England, who argued that the clampdown would make it harder to attract skilled bankers, who would instead flee to rival hubs in New York, Singapore or Zurich. The then chancellor, George Osborne, tried to overturn the measure at the European court of justice in 2014. Former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng then took advantage of Britain’s exit from the EU, and announced plans to scrap the cap in September 2022. The changes were later approved by his successor, Jeremy Hunt, with regulators formalising the change in November last year. Goldman said in a statement: “This approach gives us greater flexibility to manage fixed costs through the cycle and pay for performance. It brings the UK closer to the practice in other global financial centres, to support the UK as an attractive venue for talent.”",

        "title": "Fraudsters editing vehicle photos to add fake damage in UK insurance scam",
        "content": "A surge in fraud cases in which photos are manipulated to show fake car crash damage is alarming insurers and helping to push motor insurance costs up to record levels. The insurer Allianz said incidents where apps were used to distort real-life images, videos and documents increased by 300% between 2021-22 and 2022-23, and it added that this had “all the signs of becoming the latest big scam to hit the insurance industry”. Rival insurer Zurich UK said it was also seeing more and more claims that had been doctored using so-called “shallowfake” technology, and that this was “becoming one of the most emerging threats from a counter-fraud point of view”. While deepfakes are hoax images, videos or documents typically created using AI, shallowfakes can be created using conventional editing software on a phone and apps such as Photoshop. Allianz, which includes the general insurance arm of LV=, said in one case an individual had a photo of his van posted on his social media page as part of his business and ended up having a claim pursued in his name for an accident that never took place. LV= received images of his vehicle from the fraudsters that seemed to show the front bumper had been cracked in the alleged accident, along with a fake repair invoice for more than £1,000. The LV= fraud team investigated and found the photo was identical to the one on the social media page, except for the fact that the image had been doctored to show the fake damage. Allianz said the rapidly changing nature of fraudulent activities such as shallowfake technology and the rise of deepfakes “pose big risks to UK consumers”. Scott Clayton, the head of claims fraud at Zurich UK, said recently that shallowfakes were most prevalent in motor insurance. He highlighted how fraudsters were using image editing software to add fake registration numbers to vehicles that had been written off. “We have seen an increase in people locating total loss vehicles on salvage agents’ websites and then implanting a registration number on to that car. There are then claims made for that vehicle, and a claims handler assessing this claim would take that at face value – that it is that actual vehicle,” Clayton said. Zurich said claims that had been completely manipulated using deepfake technology – often involving totally fake engineer reports and repair estimates – were also on the rise. Clayton said that in the past, criminals who intended to scam insurers with “crash-for-cash” claims needed to physically have vehicles crash into each other. “People can now create a fraudulent claim entirely from behind their computer and extract significant sums of money because these cars are total losses.” he added. Rising levels of fraud have been one of the factors contributing to higher motor insurance premiums. This week it emerged that the average price paid for comprehensive motor insurance in the UK was about a third (33%) – or £157 – higher in the first quarter of this year than in the same period in 2023. The data was issued by the Association of British Insurers.",

        "title": "OECD forecasts will be blow to Sunak’s claims UK economy is improving",
        "content": "A lack of skilled workers in the country is pushing up UK wages. The dearth of affordable housing has seen landlords put up rent by an average of 9% in a single year, weighing on inflation. New costs and controls at the border after Brexit are creating headaches for exporting companies. This cocktail of pressures on the UK economy has prompted analysts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to undercut the UK’s own national forecasts for growth. By 2025, the Paris-based thinktank says, UK growth will be below that of any advanced economy in the G7. The OECD has pencilled in a increase in gross domestic product of just 0.4% in 2024, a lower rate than any G7 member apart from Germany. By 2025, the UK slips to the back, with just 1% growth compared with an average of 1.5% in the eurozone. Up to now, the government could at least rely on Germany to own the title of sick man of Europe, after some updates to the national statistics showed the UK recovered more quickly from the pandemic and Brexit than was previously thought. The Treasury is a little more optimistic. Its April 2024 survey of independent forecasts showed an average of 0.5% for 2024 and 1.3% for 2025. The OECD verdict will come as a blow to Rishi Sunak and his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, who claim the UK economy is improving, even though it slumped into a technical recession at the end of 2023. Hunt was quick to blame high interest rates for the OECD’s assessment, signposting statistics from the International Monetary Fund that showed the UK would grow faster than other advanced economies in the next six years. But all G7 countries have grappled with higher interest rates. While persistent inflation haunts many eurozone economies, making it harder for central banks to cut the cost of borrowing, other governments have taken a different approach to stimulating economic growth, particularly when it comes to business investment. Britain has consistently sat at the bottom of the OECD league tables for business investment. If UK business investment had matched the average of France, Germany and the US since 2008, Britain’s GDP would be nearly 4% higher today, improving wages by about £1,250 a year, analysis from the Resolution Foundation thinktank shows. The thinktank argues that rising foreign ownership of companies, alongside the lack of workers’ voices on boards, means the managers of UK companies are under less pressure to realise returns on investment when it comes. Giving workers a stake in a business creates greater engagement and personal investment in long-term profitability. The OECD outlook serves as an opportunity for the next government to offer more than just certainty about the direction of travel. If Labour is handed a mandate in the general election, it will need to bring to an end the uncertainty around border costs hitting UK exporters, increase apprenticeships to address the skills shortage, and change planning rules to get housebuilding on target. The party has outlined some ideas, but it will have to offer more detail on the industrial strategy it has promised in order to stimulate investment. An idea to create “technical excellence colleges” to address the skills shortage was light on details of what the status would bring. Meanwhile, the Sunak government is sticking to its mantra that the UK economy is getting stronger, despite figures suggesting it is still lagging behind. But moving back up the G7 rankings will require investment and fresh ideas.",

        "title": "Shell reveals $3.5bn share buyback as it faces AGM showdown over emissions",
        "content": "Shell will shower its shareholders with another $3.5bn (£2.8bn) in share buybacks over the next quarter after reporting better than expected profits of almost $8bn for the first three months of the year. The company announced it would hand investors the multibillion-dollar payouts as it prepared to face a shareholder battle over its climate agenda at its annual general meeting later this month. Shell’s “staggering cashflows” resulted in adjusted earnings of $7.7bn for the first quarter, below the $9.6bn earned in the same quarter last year but still well above the $6.5bn predicted by analysts. Its chief executive, Wael Sawan, said the results released on Thursday had given the company the confidence to start another $3.5bn buyback programme for the next three months. Its shareholder payouts in the first quarter came to $5bn, of which $2.2bn was dividend payments and $2.8bn was share buybacks. The oil company, which handed investors $23bn in payouts last year, had one of its most profitable years on record in 2023 when it reported better than expected profits of more than $28bn for the year. Shell paid £1.1bn in overall tax in the UK for 2023, of which £240m was taxed under the government’s windfall tax, known as the Energy Profits Levy. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow energy and climate minister, said: “These results show yet again why it is so damning the Rishi Sunak refuses to bring in a proper windfall tax on the oil and gas giants. These are companies that have made record profits at the expense of working people. Labour says tax these companies fairly so we can invest in clean homegrown energy that will end the cost of living crisis and make Britain energy independent.” Despite the payouts the oil company is coming under growing pressure from some shareholders to address its carbon emissions. A group including French asset manager Amundi, insurance giant Axa, and the UK government’s National Employment Savings Trust (Nest) have warned Shell that is not aligned with the Paris climate agreement. The company has been accused of watering down its green ambitions in an attempt to increase the company’s valuation by growing its liquified natural gas business and holding its oil production rates steady for the rest of the decade. Shell’s latest results showed overall oil and gas production rose by 3% in the quarter to 2.91m barrels of oil equivalent a day. The group of large European investors, coordinated by the campaign group Follow This, plans to bring a climate resolution to Shell’s AGM to push the company to do more to reduce its emissions. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: “Large shareholders hold the key to tackling the climate crisis with their votes at shareholders’ meetings. Shell will only change if more shareholders vote for change. The resolution is designed to give Shell a shareholder mandate to drive the energy transition.” The company signalled this year that it could slow the pace of its emissions reductions for this decade by setting a new plan to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade, compared with its previous target of 20%. The plan, combined with cost-cutting from its low-carbon business units, has helped to improve Shell’s share price relative to European rivals including BP. Shell’s share price reached a record high of just over £29 a share earlier this week, in part due to geopolitical upheavals of recent years that have supported higher gas and oil prices. But the company believes it could be worth more. Its former chief executive, Ben van Beurden, last month stoked fears that the oil company would quit the London Stock Exchange in favour of a New York listing because US investors were “more positive” about fossil fuels. Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Shell made bigger operating cashflows for the first quarter than Exxon – after adjusting for working capital, and a similar spending budget – but still lagged behind its larger US rival in terms of market valuation. “The valuation disconnect continues to look extreme to us,” he said. The comments reignited concerns in the City over an exodus of London’s largest listed companies to rival exchanges. These concerns were compounded this week when shareholders of Flutter, the owner of Paddy Power, voted to move its primary listing to New York. It follows the Australian miner BHP’s unsolicited takeover bid for Anglo-American, which could mean the miner disappears from the London Stock Exchange.",

Shipping giant Maersk has raised its profit guidance today, as Middle East tensions lift its earnings. Maersk told shareholders that earnings in the first quarter of this year had shown “a strong recovery” compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This was due to a good performance at its terminals business, plus higher demand and the “prolonged Red Sea crisis”. Maersk predicts that these conditions will continue well into the second half of the year, meaning it has lifted the lower end of its profit guidance range. It now expects underlying EBIT to be between -$2bn and $0bn. Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has forced many ships to reroute around Africa, rather than travel through the Suez Canal. That has pushed up shipping costs. Vincent Clerc, CEO of Maersk, explained: Demand is trending towards the higher end of our market growth guidance and conditions in the Red Sea remain entrenched. This not only supported a recovery in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter, but also provide an improved outlook for the coming quarters, as we now expect these conditions to stay with us for most of the year. Six months after the UK scrapped its cap on bankers’ bonuses, Goldman Sachs staff are about to reap the benefits. Sky News’s Mark Kleinman reports that Goldman staff have just been told that it will abolish the EU cap on bonuses for hundreds of its top UK-based staff. This will allow it to make multimillion pound payouts to its best-performing traders and dealmakers. The old bonus rules capped banker bonuses at two times their annual salary, and were brought in after the financial crisis – where a bonus culture was blamed for encouraging short-term profits over longer-term stability. Just in: The number of Americans filing new jobless claims remained low last week. There were 208,000 “initial claims” for jobless support – a proxy for layoffs – last week, matching the previous week’s level. This remains a historically low level of jobless claims, suggesting that US companies are holding onto workers. That tight labour market is one reason the US Federal Reserve is reluctant to start cutting interest rates yet. There’s a shake-up at Peloton, the one-time pandemic lockdown fitness darling. Peloton has anounced that CEO Barry McCarthy will be stepping down just over two years after he took over from founder John Foley. The exercise kit maker is also cutting its global headcount by approximately 15%, which will effect roughly 400 Peloton staff, as part of a cost-cutting plan that aims to save more than $200m per year. Peloton says: This restructuring will position Peloton for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling the company to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business. Karen Boone, current Peloton chairperson, and Chris Bruzzo, a Peloton director, will serve as interim Co-CEOs while a replacement for McCarthy is found. Peloton boomed during the at-home exercise boom during Covid, but suffered as many of its users returned to gyms. In February, Peloton’s shares tumbled when it cut its sales forecast. The oil price has risen from its lowest levels since mid-March today, amid reports that the Opec+ cartel could extend their production cuts. Brent crude has gained around 0.5% today to $89.30 per barrel. Last night it touched a seven-week low of $83.29 per barrel. Reuters reported this morning that OPEC and its allies have yet to begin formal talks on extending 2.2 million barrels per day of voluntary oil output cuts beyond June, but three sources from OPEC+ producers who have reduced production said they could extend if demand fails to pick up. Opec, and allies including Russia, are due to next meet on 1 June to set output policy. Hong Kong’s economy picked up pace in the first quarter of the year, new growth figures show. Hong Kong’s GDP grew by 2.3% in the January-March quarter, as a rise in tourists boosted services exports, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter. On an annual bases, GDO was up 2.7% – which is towards the lower end of the government’s forecast. More than 10,500 of London’s black-cab drivers have launched a £250m legal case against Uber, accusing it of breaking the capital’s taxi booking rules and deliberately misleading authorities to secure a licence. The case, which has been filed in the high court in London by the litigation management firm RGL, resurrects a claim first raised five years ago, related to the way the ride-hailing app operated in London between 2012 and 2018. Cabbies allege that Uber allowed drivers to take bookings directly from customers rather than through a centralised system like those used by minicab services, in a direct breach of private hire rules. They allege Uber was aware of the rules and deliberately misled Transport for London (TfL) about its booking model in order to obtain an operating licence and take business from black-cab drivers. The UK will be the worst-performing economy in the G7 next year, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, as high interest rates and the lingering effects of last year’s surge in inflation weigh. In a downbeat assessment, the Paris-based thinktank also downgraded its forecast for UK growth this year to 0.4% from a November forecast of 0.7%. The UK will fall to the bottom of the G7 growth league in 2025, the OECD predicts, with growth of 1%, just behind Germany at 1.1%. US and Canada are forecast to be the fastest growing economies the G7 next year, both growing 1.8%. More here. The OECD also points out that 2023 was a difficult year for many countries, including the UK: A rising number of economies experienced a technical recession in 2023, with two or more consecutive quarterly output declines. Output declined in 12 OECD economies over the year to the fourth quarter, including Germany and the United Kingdom, and stagnated in the euro area. This weakness in Europe reflects the lingering effects from the large energy price shock in 2022 and the slowdown in credit growth in economies with a relatively high dependence on bank-based financing The encouraging message from the OECD today is that the world economy is likely to avoid a stagflationary rut. Today’s economic outlook upgrades the forecast for global growth this year to 3.1%, from 2.9% in February, with the US and India’s forecasts lifted the most. Global growth is then seen inching up to 3.2% in 2025. Inflation is expected to drop, though, from an OECD average of 5% this year to 3.4% next year. The OECD says that the overall risks around the outlook are becoming “better balanced”, but flags there is “substantial uncertainty”. It adds: High geopolitical tensions remain a significant near-term adverse risk, particularly if the evolving conflicts in the Middle East were to intensify and disrupt energy and financial markets, pushing up inflation and reducing growth. The latest economic data from the eurozone isn’t too cheering, either. The euro area’s manufacturing sector took a turn for the worst last month, shrinking at a faster rate than in March, according to the monthly poll of purchasing managers from S&amp;P Global. The eurozone manufacturing PMI fell to 45.7, down from March’s 46.1, which is a four-month low. However, the PMI’s output index did rise to a 12-month high of 47.3, still below the 50-point mark splitting expansion from contraction. That indicates factory production fell at the slowest pace in a year. Factories reported that new order declined at a faster rate, suggesting weak demand is hurting the manufacturing sector. Dr Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, says: “What is going to rescue the Eurozone economy? While this is a difficult question, one thing is clear: It’s not the manufacturing sector. Instead, this sector is prolonging its drawn out recession into April. Output shrank at a similar pace as in the months before and companies have reduced their purchases at an accelerated rate. Compounding the issue, there is no sign of a turnaround in the inventory cycle, but instead we saw a sustained trend of depleting stockpiles of both purchased and final goods in April. Data yesterday showed the UK manufacturing sector slipped into a small contraction last month, with the PMI falling to 49.1, from 50.3 in March. The latest real-time data tracking the UK economy is out, showing a dip in consumer spending last week and lower job adverts than a year ago. The Office for National Statistics reports: SPENDING/BEHAVIOUR - Aggregate UK spending on credit and debit cards decreased by 1% in the latest week and fell by 8% when compared with the equivalent week of 2023; while, when compared with the previous week, retail park footfall increased by 3% and transactions at Pret A Manger stores increased in 8 of 10 location categories. JOB ADVERTS - Figures from Adzuna show the total number of online job adverts on 26 April 2024 remained broadly unchanged when compared with the previous week but was 20% below the level seen for the equivalent period of 2023. Today’s OECD forecasts show the UK is stuck in the ‘slow growth’ lane, warns Barret Kupelian, chief economist at PwC UK Kupelian explains: “The OECD expects UK economic activity to grow by 0.4% this year and 1% next year. However, the OECD’s forecasts show the UK is stuck in the ‘slow growth’ lane, when compared to other large European economies. This is also supported by our own in house forecasts. “In the short-term, we expect economic activity to pick up, mainly led by private sector activity and consumer spending. Some of this will be helped by the Bank of England likely gradually easing its monetary policy in the second half of the year. The report suggests there is momentum to the UK’s economic turnaround in key economic areas, including house purchase activity and a rise in both consumer and business confidence. “Long term, the UK will need to build a comprehensive industrial and services plan which addresses its main economic shortcomings, i.e. planning rules, skills reform, and issues surrounding the provision of public services. Building a framework to address these areas whilst also dealing with the green and digital transitions will be key to grow private and public sector productivity and resilience.” The OECD expects the Bank of England will start to cut interest rates by the autumn. It says: Monetary policy is assumed to start easing from the third quarter of 2024, with Bank Rate gradually lowered from its current peak of 5.25% to 3.75% by the end of 2025, as inflation continues converging towards target. Incidentally, the OECD’s chief economist, Clare Lombardelli, is joining the BoE this summer as deputy governor. The OECD also predicts that UK unemployment will rise “as the labour market cools”. It also expects that rising wages will support consumer spending over the next two years. While that’s better news for workers, it could also add to inflation pressures – making it harder for the Bank of England to lower interest rates. The OECD’s report says about the UK: GDP growth is projected to remain sluggish at 0.4% in 2024 before improving to 1.0% in 2025, reflecting the waning drag from past monetary tightening. Stronger real wage growth will support a modest pick-up in private consumption. Headline inflation is expected to continue moderating towards target as energy and food prices have eased substantially, but persistent services price pressures will keep core inflation elevated at 3.3% in 2024 and 2.5% in 2025. Unemployment will continue increasing and reach 4.7% in 2025 as the labour market cools, although the actual degree of slack remains uncertain. Here’s another chart showing the OECD’s new inflation forecasts: Here’s Darren Jones MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, on the OECD’s warning that Britain will be the slowest-growing member of the G7 in 2025. “Today’s news that growth has been downgraded again reminds the British people what they already know: after 14 years of failure, the Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken. “It’s time for change. Only Labour has a long-term plan to grow the economy and make working people better off.” Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical company behind the Wegovy weight loss drug, has beaten profit expectations as demand booms. Novo Nordisk’s sales increased by 22% in the first quarter, while operating profit rose by 27%. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen says: “We are pleased with the sales growth in the first three months of 2024, driven by increased demand for our GLP-1-based diabetes and obesity treatments,” Booming demand for Wegovy – which was made available in the UK last September – drove up Novo Nordisk’s share price to record levels and making it Europe’s most valuable company. The company has lifted its forecasts for the year. It now expects sales growth this year of between 19% and 27% in local currencies, compared to the previously guided range for 18% to 26% growth. Operating profit growth this year is now seen at between 22% and 30% in local currencies, slightly up from its previous forecast of 21% to 29%. However, Novo’s share price has dipped by 1.5% this morning. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has said the OECD’s forecast isn’t a surprise. Responding to today economic outlook, Hunt says: “This forecast is not particularly surprising given our priority for the last year has been to tackle inflation with higher interest rates. But now we are winning that war, growth matters which is why it is significant that last month the IMF predicted the UK will grow faster over the next 6 years than any European G7 country or Japan. To sustain that we need to stick to our plan - competitive taxes, a flexible labour market and far-reaching welfare reform.” However, the OECD’s forecasts shows inflaton will be HIGHER in the UK this year than in the US, Germany, France, Italy or the European Union, although lower than the OECD average. UK inflation is forecast to average 2.7% this year and fall to 2.3% next year – still above the Bank of England’s target – Argentina, though, could suffer 200% inflation this year: The OECD blames high interest rates for Britain’s weak growth outlook, after the Bank of England lifted borrowing costs to a 16-year high. It says: “GDP growth is projected to remain sluggish [in the face of a] waning drag from past monetary tightening.” The OECD’s new forecasts (see here) suggest the UK will be the second-weakest growing advanced economy this year, and the slowest next year. For 2024, Germany is expected to be the slowest G7 member with just 0.2% growth, behind the UK’s 0.4%, and Japan at 0.5%. France and Italy (and the eurozone) are seen growing by 0.7% this year, while Canada is expected to grow by 1%, with the US (again) in the lead with 2.6% growth. But for 2025, the UK slips to the back, with 1% growth, behind Germany at 1.1%. The OECD also forecasts a very deep recession in Argentina, followed by a recovery in 2025, as president Javier Milei drives though his free market reform package. The OECD says: Developments continue to diverge across countries, with softer outcomes in many advanced economies, especially in Europe, offset by strong growth in the United States and many emerging market economies. Newsflash: Britain’s economy will grow slower this year and next than previously thought, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned. New OECD forecasts also show the UK will suffer higher inflation than its peers. The OECD cuts its British economic growth forecast to 0.4% for 2024, down from 0.7% forecast in February. UK growth next year is expected to rise to 1.0%, compared with a previous forecast of 1.2%. It means the OECD expects Britain’s economy will grow more slowly in 2025 than France or Germany. Consumer prices are expected to rise more quickly in Britain during 2024 and 2025. Looking more broadly, the OECD says global activity has proved surprisingly resilient so far. Global GDP growth is projected to be 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025, compared with 3.1% growth in 2023. The OECD says: Global growth in 2023 continued at an annual rate above 3%, despite the drag exerted by tighter financial conditions and other adverse factors, including Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and the evolving conflict in the Middle East. Global GDP growth is projected at 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025, little changed from the 3.1% in 2023. This is weaker than seen in the decade before the global financial crisis, but close to currently estimated potential growth rates in both advanced and emerging market economies. The Fed has set the stage for “a volatile summer ahead”, says BNY Mellon’s macro strategist John Velis. He told clients: The outcome of this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting turned out to be less hawkish than we – and apparently markets – expected. The key phrase in the statement was unchanged, “The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.”, so the Fed continues to affirm its bias towards easing policy. Velis added: To us, this decision to hold, and to still view an eventual cut as the most likely future move, sets the stage for a volatile summer ahead. Effectively, the Fed is data dependent, meaning every data release – especially as relates to inflation – acts as a referendum on where the Fed will go (or not go). There hasn’t been a lot to suggest inflation is going to moderate. One of Jerome Powell’s predecessors, Alan Greenspan, once remarked: “If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.” And today, investors seem to broadly agree that the Fed wasn’t as hawkish as it could have been… Goldman Sachs are in the dovish camp – they still expect two rate cuts this year: Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, says “it’s hard to say it was a dovish meeting”: The main flashes from the Fed last night was that while the FOMC made several hawkish tweaks, Powell signalled that rate hikes remained unlikely and the Fed announced a slightly-larger-than-expected slowing of QT. It’s hard to say it was a dovish meeting but given the recent inflation prints it could have been a lot more hawkish. Kyle Rodda, analyst at capital.com, argues that the Fed’s tone was “less-hawkish-than-feared”. Ultimately, the bar was set high for a hawkish surprise last night, and the central bank did not attempt to leap it, striking an overall neutral tone and leading to a brief flurry of bullishness in the market. Slightly more than one cut was baked into the futures curve going into the meeting, with the odds of another increasing at the margins after last night’s meeting. As a result, yields edged lower, and the US Dollar dropped, with gold also rallying. Energy giant Shell has beaten City expectations this morning by reporting adjusted earnings of $7.7bn for the first quarter of 2024. Shell’s earnings were lower than a year ago – it made a bumper $9.6bn in Q1 2023 – but well above analyst predictions of $6.5bn. Shareholders will – again – benefit, with Shell announcing a new $3.5bn share buyback programme this morning. CEO Wael Sawan says: “Shell delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance, demonstrating our continued focus on delivering more value with less emissions,” Alexander Kirk, fossil fuel campaigner at Global Witness, says such huge profits show the energy system simply doesn’t work: “Shell continuing to rake in huge sums of money shows us that huge polluter profits were not a one-off but are the twisted reality of an energy system that benefits climate-wrecking companies to the cost of everyone else.” “Companies like Shell saw record profits while the energy crisis dragged millions of families into poverty through unaffordable energy bills. Meanwhile fossil fuel giants fought hard against paying more tax. “This is the sad irony of the global energy system in which those causing chaos are the ones getting rich. This spiral won’t stop until we make the urgent switch to a fairer renewable energy system that puts both people and planet first.” Back in 1971, the US Treasury Secretary John Connally caused a stir by declaring that “The dollar is our currency, but it’s your problem.” And the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rate also has global implications. If US interest rates stay higher for longer, it’s hard for other central banks around the world to cut interest rates without weakening their currencies against the greenback (which is inflationary). Investors have been cutting back on their forecasts for early cuts to UK interest rates. Currently, the money markets are pricing in around 42 basis points of cuts to UK rates this – that means one quarter point (25bp) cut is certain and a second is possible. In early trading this morning, the first Bank of England rate cut is fully priced in for September, although there’s a greater than evens chance it will happen in August. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Hopes of early interest rate cuts are fading today after America’s central bank left borrowing costs on hold last night and chafed at the ‘lack of further progress’ on inflation. Last night, the Federal Reserve left its policy rate unchanged, as expected, given inflation rose back to 3.5% in March – further from its 2% target. The Fed was clear that recent data has not given it the confidence it needs that inflation is moving sustainably toward target. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told reporters last night: It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for as long as appropriate. Powell added that the Fed was “prepared to respond” if the jobs market weakened unexpectedly. The Fed chair indicated he simply didn’t know when interest rate cuts will be justified, but felt it unlikely that the Fed’s next move would be to hike rates. The Fed did make one change – it slowed the pace of its quantitative tightening programme, under which it sells bonds bought under its stimulus programmes. After a volatile session on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 index closed down 0.35%. Powell’s message was that current policy was in a good place, explains ING’s economics team. They told clients this morning: At the press conference, Powell reiterated that he feels monetary policy is “restrictive” and that an interest rate hike is “unlikely”, but that will be up to the data to determine – he would need “persuasive evidence” that monetary policy isn’t tight enough. He then repeated that 16 April comment that gaining confidence inflation is coming down and they can cut interest rates is taking “longer than thought” and he doesn’t know if it will be achieved this year. However, with inflation having moved below 3% he argues that the employment goal of the Fed comes back into focus. He says the current policy stance “is in a good place” and in response to a question of a risk of stagflation – weakening growth and high inflation – he doesn’t see “the Stag or the Flation”. US interest rates are currently set at a 5.25-5.5% range. According to the CME Fedwatch tool, there’s now a 31% chance that the Fed will have cut interest rates twice by the end of this year – to 4.75%-5% – and a 38% chance of only one rate cut. At the start of this year, investors expected six quarter-point cuts, but persistent inflation has dampened those expectations.

        "title": "Danish firm behind weight-loss drug Wegovy raises profit forecast to £15.3bn",
        "content": "Strong sales of diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy have prompted the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk to raise its 2024 profit forecast to up to £15.3bn, with supply shortages starting to ease. Europe’s most valuable company, whose stock market value exceeds the size of the Danish economy, has struggled to keep up with runaway demand for the two weight-loss jabs. They have been endorsed by celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, although others such as the US comedian Amy Schumer have spoken of having to stop taking Ozempic because of the side-effects. Novo Nordisk made sales of 65bn Danish kroner (£7.5bn) in the first three months of the year, up 24% at constant exchange rates. This propelled pre-tax profits 29% higher to nearly 32bn kroner. The drugmaker is now expecting sales to grow between 19% and 27% this year, up from its previous estimate of between 18% and 26%. Operating profits are now forecast to increase between 22% and 30%, up from a previous estimate of 21% to 29%. Last year it made an operating profit of 102.6bn kroner. Novo’s chief executive, Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, said 27,000 people were starting to use Wegovy injections for obesity every week in the US, up from 5,000 each week in December. The company is spending billions to expand its manufacturing capacity. The success of the drugs has resulted in “periodic supply constraints” and shortages. However, in January Novo Nordisk said it had doubled supply of “starter doses” for new Wegovy patients in the US after constraints forced it to restrict the release of the injections last May. Wegovy and Ozempic are part of a new class of weight-loss and diabetes drugs known as GLP-1, which are injected once a week and suppress people’s appetite. The GLP-1 agonist mimics the action of a hormone that is naturally released by the stomach when people eat food. They have helped some people lose significant amounts of weight but can cause unpleasant side-effects such as nausea. Novo Nordisk said higher sales volumes and competition with rival drugs had pushed down the price of Wegovy, leading to lower revenues than analysts had expected. However, this was offset by sales of Ozempic. Pressure is mounting on the company to reduce its prices further. Bernie Sanders, who chairs the US Senate health, education , labor and pensions committee, launched an investigation last week into “outrageously high prices” of Ozempic and Wegovy. He noted that Novo Nordisk charges $969 (£775) a month for Ozempic in the US, but just $155 in Canada and $59 in Germany. For Wegovy, the monthly cost is $1,349 in the US, $140 in Germany and $92 in the UK. Novo Nordisk’s main competitor, the US drugmaker Eli Lilly, raised its annual sales forecast by $2bn this week on the back of the success of its weight-loss injection Zepbound and its diabetes drug Mounjaro, which are also in short supply because of a surge in demand. The Indianapolis-based company’s market value has jumped to nearly $740bn, far ahead of Tesla and Walmart. Wegovy is available on the NHS and can also be bought privately at pharmacies. The list price for a month’s supply in the UK ranges from £73.25 to £175.80 depending on the dose. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Competition is growing in the market but demand is so high that Novo Nordisk is still racing to keep up with supplies, not fretting about what a rival like Eli Lilly is doing. “However, the more products on the market and broader availability of each treatment, the greater the chance that prices will come down. This is already happening in the US. It means Novo Nordisk is facing the likelihood that weight-loss treatments become lower margin in time, hence why it needs to ramp up volumes as fast as possible as the dial shifts from earnings quality to earnings quantity.”",

        "title": "Peloton CEO steps down as beleaguered company cuts 15% of workforce",
        "content": "Barry McCarthy has stepped down as CEO of Peloton, the company said on Thursday, as it decided to cut 15% of its workforce to tackle a post-pandemic slump in demand for its connected fitness equipment. In a note, McCarthy said: “Hard as the decision has been to make additional headcount cuts, Peloton simply had no other way to bring its spending in line with its revenue.” McCarthy said Peloton was now “on the right path”. “You have a GREAT lead team, and although the stock market hasn’t recognized this yet, they will. It’s simply a matter of time,” he wrote. Shares of the beleaguered New York-based company rose as it announced it is also planning to cut back its retail presence, owing to weak demand that has forced Peloton to push back its goal of returning to profit. Karen Boone, Peloton’s chairperson, and Chris Bruzzo, Peloton’s director, will serve as interim co-CEOs. In addition, the company named director Jay Hoag as the chairperson of the board. The company’s board has started a search process to identify the next CEO. McCarthy will remain a Peloton adviser through the end of the year. The company’s sales had boomed during the pandemic as gyms closed and people tried to stay fit from home. Sales collapsed as the world reopened and McCarthy attempted to revamp Peloton as a subscription business and cut thousands of jobs. Once valued at over $50bn, the company is now worth $1.1bn. McCarthy is a former Netflix and Spotify executive and joined Peloton in February 2022, replacing co-founder John Foley. Under McCarthy, Peloton tried numerous tactics to revamp its business. The company ended its app’s free membership option, expanded into corporate wellness and brokered deals with brands including Lululemon and Hyatt hotels. As well as making big job cuts, Perloton has taken several other cost-cut measures such as changing bike prices, offering its products through third-party retailers and focusing on digital subscription plans. But the losses have continued to mount. Peloton has not made a net profit since December 2020. On Thursday the company announced that revenues had fallen again in the last quarter, its ninth consecutive quarter of declining revenues. Peloton said on Thursday it expects connected fitness members for the full year to be between 2.96 million and 2.98 million, lower by 30,000 members from prior forecast. “Peloton has discovered that fitness trends come and go and staying ahead of the curve is incredibly difficult,” Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce at research firm Insider Intelligence said. For the three months ending on 31 March, Peloton lost $167.3m, down from $275.9m for the same quarter last year. Peloton shares jumped 11% in early trading. Reuters contributed to the story.",

        "title": "Investors push to rein in Dollar General CEO pay and perks",
        "content": "Dollar General investors are pushing for shareholders to vote against executive officer compensation proposals at the company that raise “serious concerns regarding Dollar General’s governance, corporate priorities, and treatment of its workforce”. In a letter to shareholders the SOC Investment Group, formerly known as the Change to Win Federation, pointed out that the median salary for a Dollar General employee in 2023 was $18,657 annually, or over $9 an hour, while Dollar General’s CEO, Todd Vasos, received nearly $183m in compensation from 2015 to 2021. SOC is calling on investors to vote no on a “Say on Pay” resolution at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on 29 May that includes a rehire stock option package for the CEO, hefty severance agreements for executives and a substantial allowance for the CEO’s personal use of the corporate jet. Vasos served as CEO of the company from June 2015 to November 2022, when he became a senior adviser to the company before retiring in April 2023. A few months later in October 2023, Vasos returned as CEO of the company. His compensation for 2024 totals about $9.7m, but also includes several perks that could yield him substantially more through stock options. “Our critiques on the pay package are twofold,” said Tejal Patel, the executive director of the SOC Investment Group. “It’s the way they’re granting it because it’s tied to options and this new term that they sort of created called ‘rehire options’ that we’ve never really heard of before.” Patel noted the structure poses significant transparency issues, in addition to the stock options awarded by the board not being tied to performance and the exercise price for the options being set at a much lower share price than that at which the company’s stock is typically traded. Also included in the CEO’s proposed pay package is $500,000 in reimbursement for personal use of Dollar General’s corporate jet. “The company’s own peer group doesn’t even offer perks of this level,” added Patel. “I would say unusual and large perk packages can be indicative of larger problems with the executive compensation program design.” The investment group is also urging shareholders to vote no on the company’s “Say on Pay” proposal due to the severance agreements for executives, which, Patel argues, basically guarantee severance will be paid. Patel noted the terms of the agreement make it difficult to calculate the exact amount of the severance packages. “What that means is the company is effectively committing to paying these executives increasingly higher salaries either through renewing the employee agreement or through the severance if they don’t renew the agreement,” said Patel. “I think it’s important to point out the discrepancy between what the company is paying these executives to stop working at Dollar General versus what they’re paying their employees.” The letter urging shareholders to vote down Dollar General’s executive pay proposal cited that the cash severance payment to the departing CEO Jeffery Owen in 2023 was $5,625,000, the equivalent of the company’s median annual pay for more than 300 employees. In 2023, investors successfully pushed for an independent third-party audit at Dollar General on worker safety given the company being placed on Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s severe violator program due to numerous safety violations and fines at stores across the US. “It’s the company’s responsibility to basically make sure the pay packages for their leadership team are aligned with better performance overall, and that includes better oversight of their workforce and making sure they are addressing the poor working conditions in a concrete manner,” concluded Patel. Dollar General did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the effort for shareholders to vote down the company’s executive pay packages.",

        "title": "More than 10,000 London black-cab drivers launch £250m Uber lawsuit",
        "content": "More than 10,500 of London’s black-cab drivers have launched a £250m legal case against Uber, accusing it of breaking the capital’s taxi booking rules and deliberately misleading authorities to secure a licence. The case, which has been filed in the high court in London by the litigation management firm RGL, resurrects a claim first raised five years ago, related to the way the ride-hailing app operated in London between 2012 and 2018. Cabbies allege that Uber allowed drivers to take bookings directly from customers rather than through a centralised system such as those used by minicab services, in a direct breach of private hire rules. They allege Uber was aware of the rules and deliberately misled Transport for London (TfL) about its booking model in order to obtain an operating licence and take business from black-cab drivers. Uber has denied the allegations and says the claim is unfounded. The drivers, who are being advised by the law firm Mishcon de Reya, argue in their suit that they faced unfair competition, and lost out on customers and income, as a result. Garry White, a black-cab driver of 36 years, said: “This claim seeks justice and fair compensation on behalf of cab drivers across London. Uber seems to believe it is above the law and cabbies across London have suffered loss of earnings because of it. It is time they were held to account.” RGL said that if the cabbies were successful in their claim they could secure more than £250m, with individuals potentially winning £25,000 or more. An Uber spokesperson said: “These old claims are completely unfounded. Uber operates lawfully in London, is fully licensed by TfL, and is proud to serve millions of passengers and drivers across the capital.” It marks the latest bout of legal trouble for Uber. In March, the San Francisco-based company reached an A$272m settlement (£142m) to compensate taxi and hire-car drivers who said they lost out when the company “aggressively” moved into the Australian market. That class action, which was launched five years ago, was filed on behalf of 8,000 taxi and hire-car owners and drivers, who argued that Uber X launched in Australia with the intention of hurting their business. The suit also alleged that the company used unlicensed cars with unaccredited drivers in a “conspiracy by unlawful means” and misled regulators. Dale Forwood, a black-cab driver of 12 years, said he hoped the London case would bring justice for local cabbies. “I am delighted to see this claim being filed today and that we will finally have our day in court,” he said. “Having seen for myself the harm that Uber’s unlawful behaviour has caused to hard-working cabbies, I look forward to justice being served.”",

        "title": "UK will be worst performer in G7 next year, OECD forecasts",
        "content": "The UK will be the worst-performing economy in the G7 next year, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, as high interest rates and the lingering effects of last year’s surge in inflation drag on growth. In a downbeat assessment, the Paris-based thinktank also downgraded its forecast for UK growth this year to 0.4% from a November forecast of 0.7%. The UK will fall to the bottom of the G7 growth league in 2025, the OECD predicts, with growth of 1%, just behind Germany at 1.1%. US and Canada are forecast to be the fastest growing economies the G7 next year, both growing 1.8%. The OECD said Britain’s growth rate would be dampened by persistent price rises in the services sector and shortages of skilled staff that will push back expected cuts in interest rates. The thinktank expects the Bank of England to delay the first cut in interest rates from 5.25% until the autumn after fears that prices growth could rebound. The assessment followed a more optimistic outlook for the global economy, which the OECD said was gaining in strength despite the threat of worsening conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. “There are some signs that the global outlook has started to brighten, even though growth remains modest,” it said in a half-yearly health check. Global GDP growth is projected to be 3.1% in 2024, unchanged from 2023, before edging up at 3.2% in 2025 helped by stronger growth in household incomes and lower interest rates. IGrowth rates in France and Germany were also downgraded while the US economy has accelerated according to the OECD. Germany was expected to grow by 0.2% this year, down from last year’s forecast of 0.6%, while France is expected to grow by 0.7%, down from the 0.8% predicted last November. A recovery is expected in the eurozone while growth moderates in the US, India and other emerging-market economies. Annual consumer price inflation in the G20 economies – which includes the UK, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, France and Mexico – is projected to ease gradually, helped by fading cost pressures, declining to 3.6% in 2025 from 5.9% in 2024. “By the end of 2025, inflation is projected to be back on target in most major economies,” the report said. Governments representing much of the world’s output are expected to keep a tight rein on spending, even as interest rates begin to decline, allowing the effect of cheaper money rather than public spending to ease the cost of living crisis facing many low- and middle-income groups. In a warning to the UK government, the OECD said the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, “should remain prudent and focus on productivity-enhancing public investment”. Any loosening of the public purse strings should happen only after interest rates have fallen back, it said, predicting that the Bank of England will reduce the cost of borrowing from 5.25% to 3.75% by the end of next year. “Fiscal prudence is required as inflation remains above target, and spending is to be directed towards supply enhancing investment, including infrastructure, the National Health Service, and adult skills,” the report said. “Proceeding with the childcare reform will help tackle economic inactivity, but requires contingent planning to address potential bottlenecks, in particular likely staff shortages.” Cuts to Whitehall budgets already in the pipeline would reduce the government’s spending deficit from 4.6% this year to 3.5% next year, it added. Hunt said: “This forecast is not particularly surprising given our priority for the last year has been to tackle inflation with higher interest rates. “But now we are winning that war, growth matters which is why it is significant that last month the IMF predicted the UK will grow faster over the next six years than any European G7 country or Japan. To sustain that we need to stick to our plan – competitive taxes, a flexible labour market and far-reaching welfare reform.” A bounce back in GDP during 2025 of 1% would be half that projected by the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The OBR has forecast that the UK’s growth rate will rise to 1.9% next year after a steep fall in interest rates and inflation.",

        "content": "In his first public comments since his hostile Senate inquiry appearance, the Woolworths chief executive, Brad Banducci, has delivered worse-than-expected March quarter financial results and admitted the supermarket can “unequivocally improve”. Sales across the group, which includes New Zealand and Big W stores, increased by 2.8% to $16.8bn in the quarter, while its Australian food sales were up 1.5% to $12.6bn. Average prices dropped 0.2%. With the supermarket recording a modest rise in sales, customers were feeling the shock of material increases in mortgages, rent, utilities, insurance and other key household expenses this year, he told reporters on Thursday morning. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “It was a challenging quarter across the group with a noticeable shift in customer sentiment and shopping behaviours since Christmas,” he said. Investors viewed the results poorly, sending Woolworths shares 4% lower in morning trading compared with a 0.3% increase for the overall market. Overall, the share price has lost about a fifth of its value since the beginning of the year. In April, Banducci was threatened with imprisonment by the Greens senator Nick McKim at a fiery Senate inquiry hearing. He said on Thursday that Woolworths took the federal inquiry “very seriously”. The inquiry was designed to investigate how big supermarkets set prices for shoppers and use their market power when dealing with suppliers. Together, Coles and Woolworths control two-thirds of the market. “Reading all of the submissions, I took some very practical actions as to how Woolworths can deliver value to customers,” he said. Clearly communicating unit prices was a key area that needed improvement, he said, as was focusing on providing price transparency to fruit and vegetable growers to enable them to make better decisions. “The only way to approach it is constructively and there are clear learnings and areas that we can unequivocally improve,” he said. Third-quarter sales figures showed that affluent customers were shopping more often and buying less in each shop, he said. For non-food based items – including household care and pet care – customers were more “promotionally sensitive” and were looking at rival retailers, including Bunnings and Kmart, when buying those “higher ticket price” items. He said there was a trend towards dining in, and that while promotions were working well, they were “not a panacea for how we should deliver value to consumers”.",

        "title": "The budget reveals what Australia's governments actually care about. And Labor has chosen to keep jobseekers in poverty | Greg Jericho",
        "content": "In 2022 Josh Frydenberg gave the budget game away when he was reported justifying the many billions of dollars spent on Aukus by saying, “everything is affordable if it’s a priority”. Julia Gillard in 2014 also revealed the budget reality when she told the audience at the Joan Kirner justice oration “Budgets are made of choices. They make us … think about what we care about the most”. When we put those two lines together it becomes what I call the Budget Commandment: “Everything is affordable if we choose to care about it”. Over the next two weeks we are going to hear a great deal from the government about not being able to afford everything. What it means is that it has decided not to spend money on something because it has decided it is not a priority that it cares about the most. This is relevant because last week the government’s Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee (EIAC) released its second report. It recommended help for those in poverty, especially those who were unemployed. The first recommendation was to raise the level of jobseeker to 90% of the age pension. Unemployment benefits used to be around this level but in 1997 the Howard government “benchmarked” the age pension to 25% of “male total average weekly earnings”, while unemployment benefits were raised in line with inflation. Because earnings usually rise faster than inflation, the age pension has grown much faster than unemployment benefits. One of the easiest things the government could do is index jobseeker to whichever is highest of the CPI or wage price index. Doing so would cost only about $600m over the next four years. In 2009 the Rudd government also implemented recommendations from the “Harmer review”, which greatly increased the age pension but not unemployment benefits. If the graph does not display click here The other issue is that age pensioners also receive a “pension supplement” – now a maximum of $81.60 a fortnight. They also get $14.10 a fortnight for the “energy supplement” while those on jobseeker get just $8.80. It means the total age pension is now $558.15 a week while jobseeker is $385.75 – only 69% of the age pension. To get it to 90% of the pension would require a $116 a week boost to $502.34. The first thing to note about this is that it would still mean those on jobseeker are in poverty: If the graph does not display click here The second thing to note is this would cost about $4.6bn in the first year. A lot of money, yes. But remember the Budget Commandment – the government chooses what it cares about, and, if it cares about it, it is affordable. During the pandemic the Morrison government chose to temporarily double jobseeker to keep people out of poverty. And then it chose to send people on jobseeker back into poverty and the Albanese government has chosen to continue that state of affairs. If that sounds harsh, I refer you to the lines above – everything is affordable if it’s a priority. Also remember increasing jobseeker will not be a cash splash that raises inflation. Jobseeker is not a labour cost so no one needs to raise their prices. And those unemployed will not think “Woohoo, flat screen TV for me!”. No they’ll think they might be a chance to pay the energy bill and rent on time. If the government were to raise jobseeker to 90% of the age pension and index it to the higher of either CPI or the wage price index, the budget would be forecast to be in surplus a year later than is currently estimated: If the graph does not display click here Is that really a case of “cannot afford”? And consider the capital gains discount is set to deliver about $12.7bn in 2024-25 to the richest 10% of taxpayers, and the mining industry is estimated to receive the same amount it would cost to increase jobseeker in fuel tax credits. If the graph does not display click here Right now, the government chooses to keep jobseekers in poverty. The government also chooses to keep jobseekers subject to the horrors of the privatised employment services industry where 70% of people have had their payments automatically suspended, despite a parliamentary committee last year finding that number “ridiculous” given the actual levels of welfare fraud are “minuscule”. The government also chooses to subject jobseekers to “mutual obligations” which deliver no discernible economic benefit but do treat the unemployed with a level of degradation. The EIAC found that mutual obligations are “killing unemployed people’s intrinsic motivations and efforts to seek work, by drowning them and those paid to help them in a mountain of red tape, compliance requirements and pointless mandatory activities”. They recommend “immediate reform”. Personally, I would just dump them for the bad idea they are. The government also chooses to allow those on the age pension to earn $2,436.60 a fortnight before the pension cuts out, whereas those on jobseeker can only earn $1,453.50. The government chooses to do these things. This budget is not about what the government can afford but what it chooses are the things it cares about. We should not allow it to get away with saying it cannot afford things but rather demand the government own the choices it makes, and demand it makes better ones. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

        "content": "The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it is holding interest rates steady at 5.25% to 5.5%, their highest level in two decades, as inflation continues to dog the US economy. Though some had hoped the Fed would soon cut interest rates, which are at their highest level since 2007, the annual rate of inflation has stubbornly remained above 3%. The Fed’s target rate is 2%. “The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” the Fed said in a statement that was largely unchanged from its statement after its previous meeting in March, when it also kept rates steady. “The committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” While the inflation rate hit 3% last June, the lowest rate since early 2021, inflation has continued to fluctuate between 2% and 4% over the last several months. In January, inflation fell to 3.1%, down from 4.1% in December, making investors hopeful about potential interest rate cuts later in the year. But the rate rose in February and March, reaching 3.5% in March. Inflation peaked in June 2022, when the inflation rate hit 9.1%, a 40-year high. In April, after March’s inflation figures were released, Joe Biden noted that inflation had fallen 60% from its peak, “but we have more to do to lower costs for hard-working families”. “Prices are still too high for housing and groceries, even as prices for key household items like milk and eggs are lower than a year ago,” the US president said. In April, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, confirmed that Fed officials were skeptical of changing rates given the recent inflation data. Earlier in the year, some economists believed the Fed would cut rates as much as three times before the end of the year. But March’s inflation data cemented doubts about any cuts in the foreseeable future. “The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it is likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,” Powell said at the time. Powell echoed the Fed’s lack of confidence that inflation is cooling enough to cut interest rates at a press conference following the announcement. “In recent months, inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2% objective,” Powell said, noting that inflation this year has been higher than expected. “It is likely that gaining confidence will take longer than previously expected.” Powell said the Fed is willing to maintain interest rates for “as long as appropriate”. When taking questions, Powell noted that it is unlikely that the next interest rate move will be a rate hike, rather officials are thinking of how much longer they should maintain the current rate. “Inflation is moving sideways,” Powell said, noting that the Fed is also keeping a close eye on the labor market, which has remained strong despite higher rates. The Fed’s next Federal Open Market Committee will take place on 11 June and 12 June.",

        "title": "Nearly half of Smith & Nephew investors revolt against CEO pay rise ",
        "content": "Smith &amp; Nephew had a shareholder revolt on Wednesday when nearly half of voting investors rejected the medical device manufacturer’s plans to raise its chief executive’s pay packet to $11.8m (£9.5m). But the company’s pay policy, which will increase the maximum payout for Deepak Nath – who is based in Texas – by nearly a third, was narrowly approved, despite 43% of votes cast against the proposals at its annual general meeting in Watford. The firm is among a growing number of companies that have been arguing for an increase in executive pay to match US peers. Smith &amp; Nephew’s chair, Rupert Soames, who is also chair of the business lobby group the CBI, has said that the proportion of revenues a company makes overseas should be taken into consideration, meaning it should not be benchmarked against UK-listed rivals. Smith &amp; Nephew is now promising to hold discussions with aggrieved shareholders in the coming months in hopes of easing tensions over pay demands. “The board is grateful for the engagement of shareholders and proxy agencies in our extensive consultation exercise ahead of the AGM and is pleased that all resolutions were passed at today’s annual general meeting,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. “We will continue to engage with shareholders and proxy advisers, and provide an update on further consultations within six months of today’s AGM in accordance with the UK corporate governance code.” Under the pay proposal passed on Wednesday, its chief executive’s pay will hit $11.8m next year if all targets are met, which would be a 29% increase from his current maximum pay packet of $9.2m. Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said: “The arguments for executive pay hikes on this scale imply quite a depressing view of how wealth is created – namely that it’s all down to superstar CEOs and there’s a fixed supply of them, necessitating a bidding war over recruitment and an escalation in top pay. We ought to be a bit more sceptical of some of these claims.” The revolt follows a damning report by the proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which called the policy “excessive” and said shareholders should reject the pay proposals. ISS said it had “material concerns” about the size of the rise and the structure of the new policy as it handed US-based executives more shares in the company irrespective of their performance. However, Glass Lewis, another proxy adviser, supported the remuneration deal, saying there was a “compelling rationale” for increasing pay for its US-based leaders. The revolt took place just weeks after a shareholder rebellion at AstraZeneca’s annual meeting in April, where 35.5% rejected the company’s remuneration policy, which included a maximum £18.7m pay packet for the pharmaceutical company’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot. Hildyard said: “When companies succeed, it’s through the efforts of the workforce as a whole, not to mention the wider socioeconomic context. The people who reach executive roles do so in large part because they’ve been imbued with the education, networks and confidence that other people haven’t. It follows that businesses should invest a bit more in their wider workforce rather than lavishing such disproportionate resources on individual executives.”",

        "content": "Our performance has been so bad that we must pay our executives more. If this corporate pitch for an increase in top-level rewards strikes you as laughably unconvincing, you’d be surprised. At Smith &amp; Nephew, the FTSE 100 medical devices group whose shares were touching £20 in 2019 but are now £10, 57% of votes on Wednesday were cast in favour of the new remuneration scheme. The rebellion was large, but ultimately the company won. Instead of chasing a potential $9.5m (£7.6m) a year – he actually got $4.7m last time – the chief executive, Deepak Nath, can now shoot for $11.8m. At least the head of the remuneration committee, Angie Risley, didn’t try to disguise the severe limp in the artificial hip-maker’s share price. “We understand that some investors would ideally wish to see the financial performance meeting expectations in advance of increasing LTI [long-term incentives],” she wrote in the annual report. Yes, “ideally” the horse comes before the cart. The board’s argument was that the changes must happen now to “incentivise long-term stability”, a reference to the fact that Nath is the fourth chief executive in five years and every switch has caused what Risley calls “an increase in downstream senior leadership attrition”. So pay up if you don’t want more chaos. In other circumstances, one suspects even pusillanimous City fund managers would have kicked out this proposal. But the clinching factor was that the plan came draped in stars and stripes. Smith &amp; Nephew is “British in listing only” – a Brilo – as the chair, Rupert Soames, puts it, because less than 4% of its revenues are generated in the UK and more than half in the US. Since most of the executives, including Nath, work in the US, home of megabucks rewards, Soames could argue that that’s the hiring pool that matters. It is, one has to concede, a point that can’t simply be ignored. The pay numbers are absurd in the abstract, but there’s no denying that the gap between boardroom pay norms in the UK and US has widened in recent years. Smith &amp; Nephew can also point out that one of its revolving cast of chief executives did indeed quit over pay. And note that the finance director, who will continue to count the numbers from Watford, will stay on a more conventional UK package. None of which makes the sums easier to swallow. But we’ve now had three high-profile votes in which Footsie companies, against a backdrop of panic about defections from London, have played the US card as an ace and they have won every time. At the London Stock Exchange Group last month, 89% were in favour of a scheme to double the boss’s max to £13m. At AstraZeneca, 64% approved a boost for Pascal Soriot to a potential £18.7m, with implied uplifts for US-based research chiefs. At 3-0 to the Brilos (or semi-Brilos as the other two really are), there’s little point in grumbling that the system is a racket and that a chief executive, wherever he works, ought to be able to get out of bed for $9.5m a year. Smith &amp; Nephew approached this vote from a position of extreme weakness, and it still got over the line. The boardroom pay game in the UK has changed for ever.",

        "content": "George Monbiot is, as always, spot-on with his analysis of the brutal outcomes of water privatisation (How the overseas owners of England’s water companies clean up by polluting our rivers, 26 April). We, the people, were robbed by Margaret Thatcher’s heist, never consulted or asked if we wanted to sell our prized publicly owned assets. Water and the other utilities were hoovered up by new owners slavering at the prospect of extracting all the cash from the companies – “leveraging” to give it a technical term, straightforward legalised money laundering in popular parlance. The post-Brexit sewage crisis highlighted by people like Monbiot and Feargal Sharkey is the most visible result of the great stinking turd of water privatisation. Ofwat is pointless, just going through the regulatory motions while allowing the pollution to continue. Thatcher achieved privatisation with the stroke of a pen and a large majority. Keir Starmer will have the same circumstances to rectify this miscarriage after the election. I hope he has the guts to do it. Peter Timberlake Chichester • George Monbiot’s indignation about the water industry in England and Wales can’t be faulted. However, I would caution against rushing to bring water companies into public ownership. There are many models for their ownership and operation, whether public, private or mixed. It is possible to find good and bad examples of each. Ultimately all are monopolies, and a core need is for much more effective regulation to protect consumers and the environment from private-sector greed or a parsimonious public sector – both of which lead to underinvestment in assets, resulting in their declining condition and performance. It’s time to start a broader debate about sectoral reform, covering a full range of institutional, technical, financial and regulatory issues. This might include reconsidering the size of the companies, which are based on an outdated model of integrated river basin management. Regardless, public ownership alone is not going to help us.

        "content": "That’s all for today. Our US colleagues will be covering the Federal Reserve decision in a couple of hours… Here’s today’s main stories: “Sell in May and go away” is a well-known City motto. After a choppy, and rather quiet day, the London stock market has closed slightly in the red. The FTSE 100 has ended the session down 22 points at 8121 points. That takes it away from the alltime high of 8199.95 points struck yesterday morning. Trading was subdued due to Europe being closed for Labour Day. Ocado was the top faller, down 3%, tracking losses in US teck stocks. GSK was among the top risers, up 1.67%, after lifting its profit forecast (see earlier post). Stocks on Wall Street are mixed today, after today’s PMI report showed US manufacturing shrinking. The S&amp;P 500 index of US stocks has lost 0.25%, dipping by 12 points to 5,022.8 points. The Dow Jones industrial average, though, has nudged up by 0.2%. America’s factories have mirrored their UK counterparts, by shrinking last month. Economic activity in the US manufacturing sector contracted in April, the latest survey from the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) shows. That reverses the expansion recorded in March, which followed a 16-month slump. The ISM’s manufacturing PMI dropped to 49.2 percent in April, down 1.1 percentage points from the 50.3 percent recorded in March – and below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. Firms reported a drop in new orders last month. There are also signs that inflation pressures are building. The Prices Index component of the index jumped to 60.9 percent, up from 55.8 percent in March, driven by a rise in costs for commodity prices such as crude oil, aluminum, steel and plastic. The survey shows that US manufacturing is “struggling for momentum”, says Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics. Brown told clients: The fall in the ISM manufacturing index back below the theoretical 50.0 no-change level in April suggests that the nascent recovery in the manufacturing sector may already have gone into reverse. While the further rise in the prices paid index to a 22-month high looks concerning, that largely reflects the rise in oil prices at the start of the month, which has since been fully reversed. US job openings were little changed in March compared with February, new data shows, suggesting demand for workers is stabilizing at an elevated level. There were 8.5 million job openings on the last business day of March, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. That’s slightly lower than a month earlier, when there were 8.8m vacancies. The number of hires “changed little”, according to the latest JOLTS report, at 5.5 million while the number of total separations decreased to 5.2m. Around 3.3 million workers quit their jobs, down from 3.5 million in February, while while 1.5 million were laid off or discharged, down from 1.68 million a month earlier. Environmental activists have disrupted the start of Unilever’s annual general meeting in London today, in a protest over plastic pollution. They are urging Unilever CEO Hein Schumacher to take action on their plastic pollution problem, particularly at its personal care brand Dove. Greenpeace UK members used a confetti cannon to fire a shower of black paper Doves raining over the Unilever board. One protestor told the executives that they were “chief plastic polluters”, and that a letter calling on Unilever and its cosmetics division Dove to ditch single-use plastic had 140,000 signatories. Greenpeace are calling on Unilever to stop sachet sales now, and phase out single-use plastic within 10 years. Here’s a video clip from the AGM: Nina Schrank, head of plastics at Greenpeace UK said: “From palm oil to plastic pollution, Unilever can’t hide from the Real Harm they’re causing. Whilst products like Dove help Unilever rake in billions, the real cost is paid by communities far from today’s AGM. But civil society and impacted communities are here today to tell them this has to end - it’s time to change. This is not the time to backpedal. Schumacher needs to be reducing plastic waste, not his waste targets. They must stop selling plastic sachets now, commit to phasing out single-use plastic within a decade and advocate for this same level of ambition at UN Global Plastics Treaty negotiations.” Bosses at Barclays are swinging the job cutting axe, Reuters reports (and on Labour Day too!). The bank is cutting a “a few hundred roles” in a round of redundancies aimed at tackling “underperformers” and reinvesting in new talent. Barclays said in February it was planning to cut costs by £2bn. Staff impacted by the job cuts are said to be based in the bank’s global markets, investment banking and research division. A Barclays spokesperson has described the cuts as ‘difficult, but necessary’, saying: “As previously reported, we regularly review our talent pool to ensure that we can invest in talent and deliver for clients. “This is difficult, but necessary, to ensure we position ourselves for long-term success as we execute against our strategy.” UK job creation remained strong last month, new data shows, despite the burden of higher interest rates. Payroll operator ADP has reported that private company payrolls increased by 192,000 in April, more than the 175,000 which economists expected. “Hiring was broad-based in April,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP, adding: “Only the information sector – telecommunications, media, and information technology – showed weakness, posting job losses and the smallest pace of pay gains since August 2021.” Services firms raised their payrolls by 145,000, while manufacturers took on 47,000 workers. Pay rose by 5%, down from 5.1%. Pay growth for job-changers fell from 10.1% in March to 9.3%, but remains higher than it was at the beginning of the year, ADP adds. Johnson &amp; Johnson is proposing a $6.5bn settlement to conclude tens of thousands of lawsuits alleging that its baby powder and other talc products contain asbestos and cause ovarian cancer. J&amp;J says the proposal would resolve 99.75% of the pending talc lawsuits, and bring its total payout to $11bn. Erik Haas, worldwide vice president of litigation at Johnson &amp; Johnson, says: “The Plan is the culmination of our consensual resolution strategy that we announced last October. Since then, the Company has worked with counsel representing the overwhelming majority of talc claimants to bring this litigation to a close, which we expect to do through this plan.” Under the plan, J&amp;J’s subsidiary, LLT Management, would file a consensual “prepackaged” Chapter 11 bankruptcy, if 75% of claimants vote in favor of the Plan. J&amp;J says the offer, which would be paid over 25 years, is “a far better recovery than the claimants stand to recover at trial”. Last year, a US judge rejected a proposal under which J&amp;J would have paid $8.9bn to settle lawsuits, premised on a bankruptcy court order that would have stopped future lawsuits from being filed against the company. Mulberry, the luxury British brand best known for its leather handbags that can cost more than £1,600 each, has reported a 4% decline in annual sales, becoming the latest high-end company to warn of a slowdown in spending among the richest shoppers. In a trading update, Thierry Andretta, the chief executive, said: “While we achieved positive revenue growth in the first half, Mulberry has not been immune to the broader downturn in luxury spending experienced in recent months, particularly in the UK and Asia. This decline was partially offset by positive trading in the US, where we have benefited from increased brand awareness. “Looking ahead, the trading environment in the UK and China remains challenging and we do not expect this to change in the short-term. We are therefore managing the business prudently, focusing on executing our strategy and vision to become a global sustainable luxury brand.” Today is the 20th anniversary of Poland joining the European Union. And Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister (and former president of the European Council) has said that EU membership has been good for Poles – and that within five years, they’ll be wealthier than their counterparts in Britain. Tusk posted on X today: As we celebrate 20 years in the EU, a fierce debate is taking place in Great Britain caused by the World Bank’s forecast that income per capita will be higher in Poland than in the UK in 2025. And I promise this: on the 25th anniversary, Poles will be wealthier than the British. It’s better to be in the EU! Last year, Labour leader Keir Starmer warned that Britian was on a trajectory that will soon see it overtaken by Poland, citing World Bank data. The BBC reported at the time: It [Labour] said UK GDP per capita grew at an average annual rate of 0.5% in real terms between 2010 and 2021, while Poland’s grew 3.6%, (based on World Bank data). If those trends continued, by 2030 people in the UK would each be £500 ($600) poorer than Poland’s population, Labour said, and by 2040 would have fallen behind Hungary and Romania. Britain is still adjusting to Brexit; yesterday, food importers warned that newly introduced checks could increase their costs by up to 60%, pushing up prices for customers and driving some shops out of business. However, there is still rather a large cap in GDP per capita between the UK and Poland, although it is narrowing, according to this chart on the World Bank’s site today: Over on Wall Street, Yum Brands – the company behind Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell – has reported a drop in profits and like-for-like sales, highlighting the squeeze on consumers. Yum Brands missed expectations by reporting a 3% drop in same-store sales in the first quarter of this year, with GAAP operating profit declining by 1%. David Gibbs, CEO, said: “Despite a difficult operating environment, we delivered 6% Core Operating Profit growth demonstrating the resilience of our business model. As expected, same-store sales were pressured this quarter, but we are encouraged by strong 2-year same-store sales growth and positive momentum exiting the quarter.” For the first time, more than half of Yum’s sales were digital, with almost $8bn of sales made electronically. The fact that UK manufacturers are hiking prices (see 10.21am) should not necessarily delay an interest rate cut, argues Professor Costas Milas of the Management School at the University of Liverpool. He tells us: What escaped attention is fresh Divisia money data. Divisia money, as a measure of liquidity, is a powerful predictor of future inflation. The latest data suggests that Divisia money contracted by 6.2% per annum in 2024Q1. Admittedly, the annual contraction has just started reversing faster than before. This should not be a problem for inflation since Divisia money growth is still in deep negative territory. In my view, inflation is likely to drop well below the 2% target before divisia money growth turns positive. Activists have taken to the streets in cities across Asia and Europe today to mark International Workers’ Day. As is traditional, the first day of May is Labour Day – a time to call for improved rights for workers, and to protest over issues such as rising prices and government labour policies. And in Istanbul, protesters have clashed with riot police Newsflash: One of the London stock market’s major blue-chip members is shifting its primary listing across the Atlantic. Sharesholders in Flutter have backed a proposal to move the primary listing of its shares from London to New York today, at its annual general meeting in Dublin. The move comes after the world’s largest online betting company added a secondary listing in the United States. The resolution to move to a primary U.S. listing was backed by 98% of shareholders, according to proxy votes tallied up at the company’s annual general meeting, Reuters reports. Flutter said in March that it expects the primary listing to become effective on May 31. Flutter’s brands include Paddy Power, Betfair and PokerStars, as well as American gambling site FanDuel. In January, it described the New York stock exchange as its “natural home”, with the stateside online sports betting boom meaning the US betting market is now Flutter’s largest by revenue. Amid the furore over executive pay, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry – criticised as “excessive” by governance experts – GSK chief executive Emma Walmsley said today: “Personally, I think I’m very well paid and I’m certainly not going to comment on the level of my own remuneration. That’s the responsibility of the board and they obviously set pay against published targets. “The much more important thing for me to work on and comment on is how we make sure that GSK, the culture of our company, the prospects of our company, the career development opportunities at our company, are really as attractive and as globally competitive as they possibly can be. So that we can recruit and develop and retain the very, very best people and honestly, I am feeling really good about that, as I look at the ongoing strengthening of the leadership teams across the organisation.” Walmsley’s pay package jumped by 50% to £12.7m last year, mainly because of a higher share bonus payout reflecting the British drugmaker’s improved performance. Her counterpart at AstraZeneca, Pascal Soriot, was paid nearly £17m last year and is in line for a maximum of £18.7m this year, depending on the company’s performance. His pay package was approved recently despite a sizeable shareholder rebellion. Geopolitical instability hurt UK factories last month, reports Caroline Litchfield, partner and head of manufacturing and supply chain sector at Brabners: “Hopes of a recovery in the UK’s manufacturing sector will need to be put on ice for now, as March’s lift in activity proved an anomaly. “Indeed, supply-side barriers including delays to raw material deliveries and high input cost rumble on. “And while domestic demand has picked up, geopolitical instability has fractured supply chains globally – most notably with disruptions in the Red Sea causing congestion at Mediterranean ports – to restrict international orders.” The Bank of England may be concerned that today’s PMI report shows that manufacturers lifted their selling prices last month. Output charge inflation hit an 11-month high, as factores passed on their rising costs to customers. James Brougham, senior economist at Make UK, says: “This is a reminder that growth prospects for manufacturers teeter on a knife’s edge. More ominously there are indications that businesses are hiking their prices again at the fastest rate in over a year, outpacing any decision to soften the base rate from the Bank of England and highlighting that inflation can occur despite tightening monetary policy. The sector seems to be returning to the situation it found itself in only a year ago with low demand, high inflation and no clear route back to prosperity. If supply-side inflation continues, it’s almost certain the Bank will delay any decision to lower rates, or even return to raising them in the extreme.” Boudewijn Driedonks, partner at McKinsey &amp; Company, is also concerned that price pressures are increasing: The UK’s manufacturing sector experienced a modest pullback in April, breaking the trend of recovery and slipping back into contraction. Growth was hampered by lower output levels linked to weaker market conditions overall, which is also showing in a weaker labour market. The drop down to 49.1 is still only slightly below the magic 50 mark. The next few months will tell us if this flatlining is a true reversal of the recent recovery trend or not. “Zooming out to the wider economy, we are seeing a story of two halves. The service sector remains strong, and April saw service sector firms accelerate growth to the strongest level for 11 months. This month’s PMI again emphasises that manufacturing is the weak link in the economy. There are also signs of possible price pressures building for the future - wage bills are growing, and input prices are increasing. Dave Atkinson, SME &amp; Mid Corporates head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank, says: “Manufacturers’ output falling back into contraction after a month of growth in March suggests the economic headwinds that have been affecting the sector this year are still bearing down on firms. “Despite this fall, there is still cause for optimism. Inflation is slowly falling, which should help to boost demand and consumer confidence this year, and firms are benefitting from deepening their relationships with UK suppliers to minimise the impact of any future global supply chain shocks. “Manufacturers have seen how global events can affect their output in recent years, so they’ll be keeping a close eye on further geopolitical tensions that could offset the sector’s positive outlook in the months ahead.” Just in: UK manufacturing slipped back into contraction last month as output and new orders decline and cost pressures rise, the latest poll of factory purchasing managers has found. Data provider S&amp;P Global’s manufacturing PMI has dropped to 49.1 in April, down from March’s 20-month high of 50.3. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction; this ‘final reading’ is slightly higher than the ‘flash’ of 48.7 The survey has found that uncertain market conditions and client destocking hit manufacturers, who also suffered supply-chain disruption due to the Red Sea crisis. Worryingly, new orders fell, with manufacturers reporting weaker demand from both domestic and overseas customers. New export orders have now fallen for the last 27 successive months, with reports of weaker intakes from Germany, Ireland, Asia and the US. Average purchasing costs rose for the fourth successive month in April, with factories reporting higher costs for energy, polymers, steel, textiles, timber and transportation. Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: The sector is still besieged by weak market confidence, client destocking and disruptions caused by the ongoing Red Sea crisis, all of which are contributing to reduced inflows of new work from domestic and overseas customers, with specific reports of difficulty securing new contract wins from Europe, the US and Asia. This downturn is making manufacturers cautious, less keen to take on staff or to build up their stocks, says Dobson, adding: The news on the prices front is also worrisome for those looking for a sustainable path back to target (consumer price) inflation, with cost pressures growing in industry and feeding through to higher selling prices at the factory gate. Shares in Aston Martin are at the back of the pack on the London stock market this morning, after it reported widening losses. The luxury carmaker made a pre-tax loss of £138.8m in the first quarter, 87% larger than the £74.2m it lost in the first three months of 2023. Sales fell by a quarter, to 945 vehicles, which the optimistic-sounding chairman Lawrence Stroll attribues to the introduction of new models. Stroll says: “2024 is a year of immense product transformation at Aston Martin, with the introduction of four new models to the market before the end of the year. Our first quarter performance reflects this expected period of transition, as we ceased production and delivery of our outgoing core models ahead of the ramp up in production of the new Vantage, upgraded DBX707 and our upcoming V12 flagship sports car which we’ve confirmed today. As part of our ongoing programme of ultra-exclusive models, we will deliver a new Special in the fourth quarter of the year. Aston Martin has dropped to the bottom of the FTSE 250 leaderboard, down 7.6% at 137p. High street retailer Next has reported better-than-expected first quarter sales, but cautioned that this probably won’t continue…. Next (no stranger to beating City forecasts) told shareholders that its full price sales in the last 13 weeks are up 5.7% versus last year, ahead of its guidance of 5% for the quarter. But, Next cautions that sales in the second quarter of the year will be weaker than the first quarter, because in 2023 it benefitted from particularly warm weather from late May through to the end of June. So, Next is sticking to its sales and profit guidance, with profit before tax forecast still to rise 4.6% to £960m. Neil Shah, director of research at Edison Group, says Next’s sales performance is strong, adding: The expectation of rising wages in the UK freeing up consumer spending on fashion bodes well for NEXT, whose performance is a closely watched indicator of consumer demand in the UK. The reaffirmation of profit guidance underscores management’s confidence in sustaining momentum throughout the fiscal year. Property experts have been digesting Nationwide’s data showing a 0.4% drop in house prices last month. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, agrees that rising mortgage costs are to blame: “The house price growth seen in the first two months of this year is going into reverse as higher mortgage rates take their toll on demand. Borrowing costs have risen as a strong labour market means the prospect of a rate cut has become more remote. There are added financial pressures in the system as a wave of owners roll off sub-2% mortgages agreed in early 2022. We believe demand and house price growth will pick up later this year as a rate cut moves onto the horizon.” Emma Fildes, property agent at Brickweaver, says the backtracking from lenders who have recently raised mortgage rates has hit the confidence of buyers: Matt Thompson, head of sales at Chestertons, reports that the usual spring pick-up in activity came later this year (as did spring itself! Brrrrr). Thompson says: “The uplift in market activity typically associated with spring was slightly delayed this year but became more evident over the course of April. Compared to March, we saw an increase in the number of London house hunters which also led to sellers feeling more confident about putting their property up for sale. Still, demand continued to outweigh supply in April which gave the majority of sellers the upper hand during price negotiations.” And, of course, this house price data are volatile. And Peter Arnold, EY UK’s chief economist, argues we shouldn’t read too much into April’s drop: The lenders’ house price series can be volatile from month-to-month, particularly in times when transaction levels are relatively low, making it harder to mix-adjust the data. Just as the apparent strength in January/February looked out-of-keeping with fundamentals, the latest data is unlikely to mark the start of a renewed fall in property prices. GSK has raised its 2024 profit forecast, with strong demand for its RSV and shingles vaccines. Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker said it now expects a rise of 8% to 10% in annual adjusted earnings per share, up from the 6%-9% growth it had previously forecast. It expects its sales this year to rise in the upper end of its 5% to 7% forecast range. Last year GSK launched its vaccine Arexvy for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), an infection with cold-like symptoms that can lead to hospitalisation and death in elderly people, and uptake has been strong. More than a fifth of adults in the US have received an RSV vaccine, either from GSK or Pfizer. Under chief executive Emma Walmsley, the drugmaker has focused on vaccines and infectious diseases, cancer drugs and long-acting HIV therapies. The company reported a 6% rise in sales to £7.4bn in the first three months of the year, better than the City had expected, and a profit before tax of £1.4bn, down from £1.9bn. Its core earnings per share of 43.1p came in above analysts’ expectations. Sales of the Shingrix jab for shingles climbed 18% to £900m. Nigel Railton has an impressive roster of experience to turn to, as he slides into the chairman’s seat at the Post Office, on an interim basis at least. He’s currently the chair of Argentex, the currency management services business, after stepping down from Camelot after 24 years. In 2018, he told The Times that as a boy in Crewe, there were three options after leaving school – working for Rolls-Royce, joining the railways or going on the dole. Railton took the second option, working as a “box lad” in the Crewe signal box at the age of 16. Railton explained: My job entailed booking a train. When a train left the station, you had to write it down in the book so that you could monitor the timeliness of the trains. I had to phone the station announcer and tell them the train was coming. Plus I had to make the tea and clean the signal box. That gives you a decent grounding in life. He went on to become a railway accountant, followed by jobs at Black &amp; Decker and Daewoo, before he joining Camelot. Railton said the most important event of his working life was “moving from my home town of Crewe to Watford to study to be an accountant. As well as running Argentex, he is also a trustee of the Social Mobility Foundation, which works to help young people who face structural barriers in education and work because of their socioeconomic background. Nigel Railton, the former boss of National Lottery operator Camelot, has been named as the interim chairman of the Post Office. Railton will succeed Henry Staunton, who was fired from his role in January, after barely a year in the job. The Department for Business and Trade says Railton has “a wealth of experience in transforming organisations” – which he’ll need, as the inquiry into the Horizon scandal continues. Railton will lead the Board of Directors and be invited to give Ministers his views on the future direction of the Post Office. But has he’s been named as ‘interim chair’, he may not be planning to do the job on a long-term basis. Business secretary Kemi Badenoch says: Nigel has the necessary experience to lead an organisation as large and complex as the Post Office and I’m confident he will work well with the leadership team to implement the change that is required in the organisation. The Government is committed to delivering justice for the postmasters, but also fulfil our duties to Post Office staff. I want to thank Nigel for stepping up to public service at a time of need, and I know he can help fix the issues of the past whilst transforming the company for the future. In February, Badenoch told the House of Commons that Staunton was being investigated over bullying allegations ahead of his dismissal; a week later, Staunton hit back, saying the victim of a “smear campaign”, Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK house prices dipped again in April, as rising borrowing costs made it harder for buyers to afford a mortgage. Lender Nationwide has reported that prices fell by 0.4%, on a seasonally-adjusted basis, in April – following the 0.2% month-on-month drop in March. That pulled the annual rate of house price growth down to 0.6% in April, from 1.6% the previous month, with the average house now costing £261,962. Economists had expected a small monthly rise, of 0.2%. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said: “The slowdown likely reflects ongoing affordability pressures, with longer term interest rates rising in recent months, reversing the steep fall seen around the turn of the year. House prices are now around 4% below the all-time highs recorded in the summer of 2022, after taking account of seasonal effects. At the start of this year, mortgage lenders were engaged in a price war as they slashed rates to attract buyers. But the market has changed, as City investors have reduced their forecasts for interest rate cuts this year. With just two Bank of England cuts now expected in 2024, several lenders have recently raised rates – adding to pressure on homebuyers and those looking to remortgage. Recent research carried out for Nationwide found that the biggest factors holding potential buyers back are that house prices, and mortgage costs, are simply too high. Gardner adds: Coupled with this, 84% of prospective first-time buyers said that the cost of living has affected their plans to buy, for example through having less money each month to save for a deposit. Around two thirds (67%) of respondents currently have between £0 and £10,000 saved towards a deposit. With a 10% deposit on a typical first-time buyer property currently around £22,000, it is not surprising to find that c.60% of prospective buyers have yet to save more than a quarter of their target deposit.

        "title": "Flutter shareholders vote to move listing from London to New York",
        "content": "London’s stock exchange is to lose another high-profile company after shareholders in the Paddy Power owner Flutter backed a proposal to move its primary listing to New York. Investors at its annual meeting on Wednesday voted 98% in favour of the gambling company, formerly known as Paddy Power Betfair, making the switch, which it expected to become effective by the end of May. Flutter announced in January that it would be letting shareholders vote on making New York its primary listing. Flutter is the latest in a growing list of public companies moving their primary listing from London, weakening the capital’s standing as an international financial centre. Earlier this year, shareholders at the Anglo-German travel company Tui voted to abandon the London Stock Exchange in favour of listing its shares solely in Germany. This came after the building materials company CRH last year shifted its main stock market listing to the US. The drug company Indivior also announced earlier this week that it was getting shareholders to vote on a plan to move its primary listing to New York, while the Telegraph has reported that Ocado is under pressure from shareholders to abandon London for New York. An increasing number of companies are moving away from London listings in favour of the US, where valuations and executive pay can be higher. Last month, Wael Sawan, the chief executive of Shell, said the oil company was undervalued compared with peers in the US, adding that it was looking at “all options” if the valuation gap did not close, including a switch to New York. Flutter’s vote comes as the group, which also owns Sky Bet PokerStars, and FanDuel in the US, is forecast to generate almost 40% of its revenues from the US market this year, becoming the largest market by revenue for the company. Flutter’s move to listing in the US was first mooted in February 2023 after it consulted shareholders over plans to gain a secondary listing in New York, as part of its wider growth plans in the country. Much of this growth has been bolstered by the rapid growth in popularity of FanDuel, which has become one of the country’s biggest online betting and fantasy sports platforms, after the loosening of online betting restrictions in the US in recent years. Sales in the country have risen from 10% of revenues five years ago, to 40% last year. Speaking before the US listing in January, the company called the New York stock exchange its “natural home”.",

        "title": "Bonza administrators in global talks on grounded budget carrier that helped ‘push down air fares’",
        "content": "The administrators determining Bonza’s future have held round-the-clock talks, including with international aviation figures and the owner of the airline’s aircraft, as Australia’s airports maintain the budget carrier was “instrumental in improving competition and pushing down air fares”. Administrators had meetings scheduled late on Wednesday evening and into Thursday morning with “key industry participants” in Australia and overseas, their second day working to such a schedule. They also had an “open dialogue with the lessor of the company’s fleet” of Boeing 737 Max 8 planes that remain parked at airports across the country. The five repossessed planes have been grounded until at least Friday, but it is unclear if they will ever take flight again commercially in Australia. Industry sources expect them to be flown back to the US for other lease deals. The administrators also met with Bonza’s chief financial officer, Lidia Valenzuela, “to go through the financial position of the Company with a view to updating creditors of that position in due course”. With the airline’s future in limbo, some industry insiders said that Bonza’s low-cost business model was sustainable but it had been hindered by its financing and lease arrangements. Were Bonza services to run as scheduled over the next week, the airline would have conducted 183 flights carrying as many 33,106 passengers, data compiled by the Australian Airports Association (AAA) showed, suggesting a growing customer base and business model that was helping dent Australia’s tight airline duopoly. Online forums featuring Bonza passengers unable to contact the airline have been flooded with stories of customers contesting the charges for their bookings with their banks as the only way to pursue refunds. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup While the airline’s model was to fly low-frequency, budget services to at least one regional destination on routes not currently serviced by other airlines, it did compete with Qantas, Virgin and Jetstar on some. With Bonza’s entrance, there were four major airline groups competing on a single domestic route for the first time in Australian aviation, between the Gold Coast and Melbourne. “On routes where Bonza has been competing with other airlines such as Melbourne-Gold Coast, the data is clear – Bonza has been instrumental in improving competition and pushing down air fares,” James Goodwin, the chief executive of the AAA, said. Goodwin also rubbished claims airport charges had led to Bonza’s financial troubles, pointing to competition watchdog data that airport fees make up an average 4.8% of an air fare. As administrators continued considering the airline’s future on Wednesday, the airline’s five remaining Boeing 737-8 Max aircraft in Australia sat on tarmacs; two each at its Melbourne Tullamarine and Sunshine Coast airport bases and one at Gold Coast airport. Engineering administrators boarded the aircraft on Tuesday, Guardian Australia understands, to remove the flight manuals from the aircraft – something the planes could not legally be flown without. The aircraft now sit parked away from terminals and gates, secured with concrete blocks, and are expected to be taken back to the US. Industry sources say this likely fate for the aircraft make the prospect of Bonza being bought and surviving the administration process slim, as the main value in the airline remains its air operator’s certificate. Without aircraft, reviving the airline would be costly, as the availability of Boeing 737 Max 8s that its pilots are trained on has become more scarce due to a slowdown in production at Boeing. Bonza’s management, who were blindsided by the repossessions on Tuesday morning, are understood to be eager to find a new buyer and have the airline resume operations at some point. “I cannot say much at this stage but suffice to say we are fighting this,” the chief operating officer, Michael Young, said in an internal message. The federal transport minister, Catherine King, said she had been talking with the administrators and “they’re trying to get the airline back up and running”. “I think they’ve got to look at the books a fair bit. It’s unlikely that will happen,” King said. The airline’s US owners, 777 Partners, has yet to comment on the aircraft repossessions. The private equity firm has been attempting to take over English Premier League football club Everton, loaning the club more than £200m over seven months as it tries to convince the Premier League it has the funds to complete a proposed takeover of the Toffees. Following news of Bonza entering administration, the Guardian revealed that Everton called in a leading firm of restructuring and insolvency advisers, raising further questions about 777 Partners’ takeover.

        "title": "Ex-Camelot boss Nigel Railton named as new Post Office chair",
        "content": "The ex-chief executive of the former national lottery operator Camelot has been named as the new chair of the Post Office. The business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, appointed Nigel Railton to the role on Wednesday, replacing Henry Staunton, who was sacked in January. The government said he had been chosen for the role, which he will hold on an interim basis for an initial period of 12 months, because of his experience in “transforming organisations”. Railton will oversee the company as it expects to provide millions of pounds in compensation to victims of the Horizon IT scandal while also managing the daily revelations from the public inquiry into the scandal. Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 post office operators were wrongly prosecuted because of faults with the Horizon computer system, which was developed by the Japanese technology company Fujitsu. Railton’s appointment was first reported by Sky News. The government has said he will take up the role as soon as possible, subject to the completion of pre-appointment checks. The new chair spent seven years as Camelot boss before stepping down in 2023, the year after the Gambling Commission decided to award the licence to run the UK national lottery to the rival Allwyn UK. Railton started his career working in the signal box at Crewe railway station before notching up 12 years with British Rail. He went on to work in the automotive industry and at the toolmaker Black &amp; Decker. He also chairs Argentex, a currency management service provider, and is a director at the Social Mobility Foundation. Railton once said his business idol was Adam Crozier, who was the chief executive of Royal Mail between 2003 and 2010, before the Post Office became independent of the organisation. Crozier gave evidence to the Horizon inquiry last month. After being sacked, Staunton was involved in a war of words with Badenoch after an interview with the Sunday Times in which he claimed he had been asked by the government to stall compensation payments to victims of the Horizon scandal. Badenoch rebutted the allegation, describing the comments as a “disgraceful representation” of the conversation they had. Badenoch said: “Nigel has the necessary experience to lead an organisation as large and complex as the Post Office and I’m confident he will work well with the leadership team to implement the change that is required in the organisation.” Railton said: “The Post Office plays a vital role in communities across the country. It is a national institution and its success in the years ahead matters to everyone. “This is an incredibly challenging time for the Post Office as it works to address historic failures while also striving to transform its business.” Separately on Wednesday, Emma Gilthorpe began her new job as the chief executive of Royal Mail, which demerged from the Post Office in 2012. Gilthorpe, who has been the chief operating officer at Heathrow since 2020, takes over at the struggling postal firm as its parent company faces takeover interest from its largest shareholder, the Czech tycoon Daniel Křetínský.",

        "title": "UK house prices fall unexpectedly for second month in a row",
        "content": "UK house prices have fallen unexpectedly in April for a second consecutive month, according to the building society Nationwide, as interest rate uncertainty and more expensive mortgages put a dampener on the traditional spring homebuying season. With some economists saying that two month-to-month falls in the closely watched index “start to look like a trend”, and new fixed mortgage rates continuing to creep up, the data will put further pressure on the Bank of England before next week’s interest rate announcement. The average house price in April was £261,962 – down by 0.4% on March, when the lender’s monthly index recorded a 0.2% month-on-month drop. A typical UK home is now worth £11,700 less than it was in August 2022, weeks before Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget prompted financial chaos. Nationwide also said the rate of annual house price growth fell to 0.6% in April from 1.6% the previous month. Robert Gardner, the lender’s chief economist, said: “The slowdown likely reflects ongoing affordability pressures, with longer-term interest rates rising in recent months, reversing the steep fall seen around the turn of the year.” He added: “House prices are now about 4% below the all-time highs recorded in the summer of 2022, after taking account of seasonal effects.” Last week, major lenders including Barclays, HSBC and NatWest increased the rates on their fixed mortgage deals in response to some economists pushing back their forecasts for when the Bank of England will start to cut interest rates. More lenders put up the cost of their new deals this week: on Tuesday, Nationwide lifted some of its fixed rates by up to 0.25 percentage points. Meanwhile, Moneyfacts, the financial data provider, said the average new two-year fixed mortgage rate was continuing to creep up and now stood at 5.91%. The Bank is expected to announce an interest rate cut later this year, and while some economists believe this could come as soon as June, many others believe August or September is more likely. Commenting on Wednesday’s figures, Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at the estate agent Knight Frank, said the house price growth seen in the first two months of this year “is going into reverse” as higher mortgage rates take their toll on demand. However, he added: “We believe demand and house price growth will pick up later this year as a rate cut moves on to the horizon.” The Nationwide analysis pointed to some moderation in the recent recovery in housing market activity, in which mortgage approvals rose in March to their highest level since September 2022. In a survey of first-time buyers commissioned by the building society, 49% of those hoping to take their first step on the property ladder in the next five years said they had delayed plans over the past 12 months. Of those holding back on buying their first home, 53% said it was because house prices were too high, while 41% said higher mortgage costs were preventing them from buying. Of those surveyed, 55% said they would be willing to buy in a different part of the country where house prices were cheaper, or they could get a bigger home. Tomer Aboody, a director of the property lender MT Finance, said: “With a drop in house prices said to be created by a lack of affordability among buyers and uncertainties around interest rates and inflation, some stability or help is needed. “Whether this comes from reduced interested rates, more flexibility on mortgages or potentially some stamp duty reform, buyers need to feel confident that they can commit to a purchase and move.”",

        "title": "Qantas passengers’ personal details exposed as airline app logs users into wrong account",
        "content": "Potentially thousands of Qantas customers have had their personal details made public via the airline’s app, with some frequent flyers able to view strangers’ account details and possibly make changes to other users’ bookings. Qantas said late Wednesday its app had been fixed and was stable, after two separate periods that day “where some customers were shown the flight and booking details of other frequent flyers”. The airline said this didn’t include displaying financial information, and that users were not able to transfer Qantas points from another account or board flights with their in-app boarding passes. Clare Gemmell from Sydney said that she and four colleagues encountered the problem shortly after 8.30 on Wednesday morning. “My colleague logged in and said ‘I think the Qantas app has been hacked because it’s not my account when I log in’.” When Gemmell logged into the app, she was greeted with a message saying “Hi Ben”. The app told her Ben had more than 250,000 points and an upcoming international flight. “Another colleague of mine said it looked like she was able to cancel somebody’s flight ticket,” she said. “You could see boarding passes for other people, one of my colleagues could see a flight going to Melbourne and it looked like you could interact and actually affect the booking.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The app has more than 115,000 ratings and reviews in the Apple store, where it has a star rating of 4.8. Gemmell, who works in customer data technology, said the security lapse was “pretty shocking”. “It’s a privacy breach and other people having access to my information and being able to cancel flights on my behalf is terrible customer service and very concerning,” she said. “It’s basic 101 security that they should have tested any app changes before they released it into production,” she said, referring to the moment when the app went live. She said she hadn’t been aware of an update to the app but that she since understood the app may have been updated overnight. By shortly after 8.50am on Wednesday, the app appeared to have reverted to normal, she said. Qantas launched an investigation into the breach and said in a statement that there was no indication of a cyber security incident. The spokesperson said customers would not have been able to transfer or use the Qantas Points of other frequent flyers and was not aware of any customers travelling with incorrect boarding passes. “We sincerely apologise to customers impacted by the issue with the Qantas app this morning, which has now been resolved,” they said. “Current investigations indicate that it was caused by a technology issue and may have been related to recent system changes. “At this stage, there is no indication of a cyber security incident. “The issue was isolated to the Qantas app with some frequent flyers able to see the travel information of other customers, including name, upcoming flight details, points balance and status. No further personal or financial information was shared and customers would not have been able to transfer or use the Qantas Points of other frequent flyers. We’re not aware of any customers travelling with incorrect boarding passes.”",

        "title": "Dividends payments soar globally as worker pay stagnates",
        "content": "Shareholders have proved to be more successful at securing bumper payouts than workers have at winning higher pay, according to two studies that show dividends outstripping wages by a considerable margin in recent years. Oxfam said analysis of global data showed that dividend payments to shareholders over the last three years grew an average of 14 times faster than worker pay across 31 major economies. The charity said the division of profits in economies that account for 81% of global income, or gross domestic product (GDP), is heavily skewed to shareholders, creating “a yawning gap” between the rich and those on middle to low incomes. Published to coincide with International Workers’ Day, the analysis shows that in the UK, after taking inflation into account, dividends increased by 13% between 2020 and 2023, while average wages remained stagnant. A separate study of UK data over the last 30 years by the left-of-centre Common Wealth thinktank found that between 2000 and 2019, dividend payments grew 5.5 times faster than workers’ pay on average each year. If pay had kept pace with dividend payments, workers would each be £2,844 better off a year, it concluded. If employee compensation and dividend payments had grown at an equal pace between 1988 and 2019, the report found, hourly labour compensation on the eve of the pandemic would have been almost 9% higher than it actually was. To calculate the pay/dividend gap, the thinktank used a weighted average that compensated for the relatively small amount of dividend payments compared with much larger salaries and pensions that make up the bulk of worker compensation. Between 1988 and 2019, Common Wealth found that labour compensation increased by an average of 1.6% a year, while the figure for dividends grew by 4.2%. If both had risen at the same pace of 1.9%, which represents a weighted split, labour compensation would have been 8.9% higher an hour by 2019. Common Wealth is among many organisations to highlight the power exerted by shareholders over corporate profits over the last 30 years. The situation has persisted through the pandemic and cost of living crisis as many global companies that operate in the UK, including Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestlé, found they could maintain profits margins and dividend payments. High levels of corporate profits, fuelled by government subsidies, have also been blamed for a large proportion of the rise in prices during 2022 and 2023. Oxfam said the Janus Henderson global dividend index, which monitors annual corporate dividends, was on course this year to beat an all-time high of $1.66tn reached last year. The index covers the world’s largest 1,200 corporations, representing 90% of global dividends paid. Dividend payouts climbed by 45% ($195bn) in 31 countries between 2020 and 2023, while wages grew by just 3%, the report said. If Chinese companies are excluded, global wages growth, after inflation is taken into account, fell by 3% during this period. “Using data from Wealth-X, Oxfam estimates that the richest 1% pocketed an average of $9,000 in dividends in 2023. This is equivalent to eight months’ wages for the average worker,” the report said. Amitabh Behar, Oxfam International interim executive director, said: “Corporate profits and payouts to rich shareholders have gone into the stratosphere, while wages continue to go nowhere. “Millions of people hold jobs that trap them in a cycle of working hard while still unable to afford enough food, medicine or other basics, amassing greater fortunes for the super-rich who profit from their work.” A spokesperson for Common Wealth said the findings “underscored the need to rebalance power at work to deliver a dynamic, democratic, and decarbonised economy”. They said the next government should commit to allow for sectoral collective bargaining and strong workers’ rights to boost labour’s share of corporate profits.",

        "title": "Noel Quinn’s exit seems respectable but big uncertainties about HSBC remain",
        "content": "Chief executives at HSBC, like those at Barclays, have had a habit in recent years of leaving in dramatic circumstances. The last one, John Flint, was ousted by a chairperson, the current incumbent Mark Tucker, who had appointed him only 18 months earlier. Going back to 2010, Michael Geoghegan was summoned to the Goring hotel to be told he wouldn’t be following the traditional cosy path to the chairperson’s office and therefore should decide if he wanted to stay as chief executive; he quit. By contrast, Noel Quinn’s announcement of his exit came with fewer fireworks. Or, at least, his explanation was easy to follow. Quinn says the past few years have been “intense” and he would rather do something else, such as find “a better balance between my personal and business commitments”. Since he’s 62, has been at HSBC for 37 years and has earned more money (£10.6m last year) than he probably ever thought possible when he joined the old Midland bank, getting out seems perfectly sensible. Whether it is the whole story is another matter, of course. Quinn was obliged to do seven months as an interim boss before the no-nonsense Tucker made him permanent chief executive in 2020, which was an awkward start to his innings. Meanwhile, the ambitious former finance boss, Ewen Stevenson, seems to have been under the impression Quinn would hang around; Stevenson left in late 2022, reportedly because he believed the top job wouldn’t be in play any time soon. Still, Quinn’s timing is respectable. Last year’s excitement was the big bust-up with HSBC’s largest shareholder, the Chinese insurer Ping An, which wanted to break the bank in two. HSBC won that scrap hands down; no other major shareholder joined the rebellion. Meanwhile, the share price has finally picked up. A one-third rise on Quinn’s watch is so-so, but a valuation at book value is better than many rivals, notably Standard Chartered, manage. The latest quarterly numbers, showing profits down only marginally at $12.7bn, demonstrated no short-term crises. A $3bn share buy-back helped the mood. In the long term, all the big uncertainties about HSBC remain. The next flare-up with Beijing is probably only a matter of time – the bank’s existence as a London-regulated lender that makes most of its money in Hong Kong and mainland China may eventually prove untenable. Quinn doused the flames (by offering some banker-ish pusillanimous comments) when HBSC was last in the cross-hairs of a US-China spat in 2021, but the next decade on the geopolitical front is anybody’s guess. Meanwhile, the strategy of throwing more capital at Chinese expansion is one of those bets that may turn out to be imperfectly timed. Economic growth in China has slowed and the local property market is a mess. To date, HSBC has suffered little more than a bruise in the form of a $3bn write-down on its stake in China’s Bank of Communications but, again, it’s early days. There is another reason to quit if an opportunity arises. The succession battle looks wide open. Outsiders view the finance chief, Georges Elhedery, as the early frontrunner, while insiders say Nuno Matos, the head of the well-performing wealth management operation, is the one to watch. That’s if Tucker doesn’t opt for an external candidate.",

        "title": "Grounded: Bonza poised to join long list of failed Australian airlines",
        "content": "The future of Bonza is in limbo as the fledgling budget airline enters voluntary administration – a well-trodden path in Australian aviation. While Tuesday’s developments may come as a blow to competition in an industry dominated by a duopoly, the abrupt cancellation of services and seizure of planes will trigger memories of a long history of fallen carriers. Bonza transported more than 750,000 passengers across Australia in the 15 months between its launch and sudden grounding this week. In a fiercely competitive industry dominated by Qantas group and Virgin, it had been a turbulent birth for the airline. In 2021 Bonza announced its plan to run low-cost, low-frequency flights between regional and holiday destinations that are not now serviced by existing carriers, but it was forced to wait until January 2023 to gain regulatory approval and begin operations. Its executives cultivated a brand that saw it dubbed the “bogan” airline, making headlines by offering budgie smugglers in its inflight shop and for shunning traditional travel outlets to only sell tickets through its smartphone app. The airline struggled with aircraft shortages and was forced to cancel several routes over the past year, and, as a result, had only amassed a 2% market share, according to the competition watchdog’s latest domestic aviation report this year. Bonza managed to grow from its Sunshine Coast base to also operate out of larger airports including Melbourne’s Tullamarine and the Gold Coast, ultimately servicing 35 routes, but it was unable to gain access to the lucrative Sydney airport. Breaking into Australia’s aviation industry has always been tough. Government policy allowed for only two airlines to serve routes between state capital cities, with the laws that effectively maintained the Qantas and Ansett duopoly only unwound in 1990. Tony Webber, the chief executive of the industry analyst firm Airline Intelligence &amp; Research and a former chief economist at Qantas, said that while Bonza’s business model was different and not trying to directly compete with the major airlines, it could be an uphill battle to gain a foothold in the Australian market. Additionally, without access to Sydney airport, Bonza was unable to access a large chunk of its potential market. Access to Sydney slots in particular continues to be a barrier to entry, with the government in February flagging a crackdown on the existing regime and allegations of slot hoarding to shut out competition. “The incumbent carriers can be very competitive, particularly Qantas, which is hyper competitive,” Webber said. “They realise that to preserve profitability they have to get on the front foot with the competitor.” Webber noted that Qantas had roughly 65% market share; together with Virgin, the two operate about 90% of the market. “You’ve got to have a strong point of difference to the incumbents if you’re going to succeed,” he said. “Just because an overseas market with a similar population can successfully run four or five carriers, it doesn’t mean [that] will succeed here.” With Bonza’s future now to play out through the administration process, the carrier appears set to join a long list of airlines that made an attempt to dent Qantas’ dominance and the duopolistic history of Australian aviation. Tigerair Australia 2007-20 The latest major Australian airline to have vanished from airport departure screens, Tigerair positioned itself as a low-cost carrier. Its 13 years in Australian skies saw domestic air fares between major cities plummet to historically low levels as the airline fiercely competed with the Qantas-owned budget operator Jetstar. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Initially owned by its Singaporean parent company, the airline was acquired by Virgin Australia over several years, coming to fully own it by 2014. All Tigerair flights were grounded due to the Covid pandemic, and the brand was retired during the voluntary administration from which Virgin Australia emerged as Australia’s leaner, significantly scaled-back second airline. Air Australia 2011-12 Growing out of its earlier freight-only operations and rebranding to Air Australia in August 2011, the low-cost carrier launched domestic and international flights with its fleet of four jets – an Airbus A330 and three A320s – from its Brisbane base to cities including Melbourne, Honolulu and Bali. But by February 2012 the airline’s owners placed Air Australia into voluntary administration. A fuel supplier refused to refuel its aircraft in Phuket due to outstanding payments and administrations later discovered the airline owed creditors up to $90m. About 4,000 passengers were stranded internationally and in Australia when it entered voluntary administration. A month later Air Australia went into liquidation. Ozjet 2005-06 The airline with business class-only seating launched in November 2005 with several services a day between Sydney and Melbourne. While it had grand expansion plans, Ozjet struggled to attract the domestic business market. By March 2006 the airline announced it would cease all scheduled services. It later pivoted to charter flights and took over regular services between the Australian mainland and Norfolk Island, but ultimately abandoned its business-only scheduled service concept. BackpackersXpress 2003-05 While the story of BackpackersXpress presaged Bonza’s tongue-in-cheek “bogan” branding and marketing push, this low-cost airline never actually took to the skies. Announced in 2003, the idea for BackpackersXpress was an airlines aimed at cheap flights between Europe, Asia and Australia to ferry in backpackers between the continents. The airline had a deal to paint large VB logos on its engines, with the advertising for the airline’s official brewer to fund its low-cost model, and had signed the Neighbours actor Ryan Moloney – known for playing the series mainstay “Toadie” – as its public face. The Australian-headquartered carrier had hoped to raise $80m but lost its funding after its applications to fly services to the UK were rejected on the basis it hadn’t proven it could actually operate the flights. The company folded by April 2005. As such, the promised pub-in-the-sky feature of its Boeing 747 fitout never took off. Impulse 2000-01 While Impulse had existed as a regional operator of smaller planes since 1992, its expansion into a major low-cost airline operating larger jet aircraft in 2000 was a serious development for the aviation industry. Together with the new-to-market Virgin Blue – the original name of Virgin Australia – it meant competition for the duopoly that had become Qantas and Ansett. It even had a bright blue Boeing 717 with a cartoon cockatoo on its tail. But, facing a bleak financial outlook after funding was withdrawn, Impulse agreed to wet lease – where an airline provides its planes and crew – all its services to Qantas, who later bought out and absorbed the airline into QantasLink. Ansett 1936-2002 An airline with markedly different story to the swathe of failed startups, Ansett was a mainstay of Australian skies in the 20th century, operating regionally, across major domestic legs and internationally. But competition from Qantas and other budget ventures, alongside costly maintenance and wage bills, left the airline haemorrhaging money and deals to purchase Virgin Australia or be rescued fell through. The airline entered voluntary administration on 12 September 2001 and, while its planes did fly again after efforts to keep it in the air, Ansett ultimately ceased all flights in March 2002, bequeathing its position in the duopoly to Virgin Australia. Compass 1990-91, 1992-93 Australia’s first budget airline after the deregulation of the country’s aviation industry laws, Compass launched flights between Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth, and later Adelaide. But the airline collapsed in December 1991, 12 months after launch, due to intense competition and discounting from rivals, and its failure to make money by transporting freight in the bellies of its planes. The airline was revived in August 1992 by different owners choosing to use the brand. But Compass Mark II was also hit by sustained price wars and, after reporting a half-year loss of $10.95m in its first six months, it collapsed in March 1993. Its chairman was later convicted of false accounting linked to the airline’s downfall.",

        "title": "Eurozone escapes recession; UK mortgage approvals hit 18-month high – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up…. here’s the main stories, on the day the eurozone bounced out of its technical recession, and take-up of UK mortgages rose. France’s central bank governor has suggested the European Central Bank now has the confidence it needs to cut interest rates at its next meeting in early June. Reuters has the details: French and euro-zone inflation data released on Tuesday gives confidence the European Central Bank will be able to start lowering interest rates in early June, ECB member and Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on social network Linkedin. As we covered this morning, eurozone annual inflation was unchanged at 2.4%, close to the ECB’s 2% target, while France’s inflation rate slipped to just 2.2%. This year’s early Easter helped the eurozone to beat growth expectations in the first quarter of the year, say analysts at ABN AMRO. They told clients today: Eurozone GDP growth came in at 0.3% qoq in 2024Q1, stronger than our and consensus expectations for a more modest 0.1% rise. Today’s upward surprise comes after a 5 quarter period in which the bloc’s economy stagnated. We only have details for some individual countries, but based on this and monthly aggregate data the strength was probably driven by net exports, services consumption (partly due to the earlier timing of easter), and stronger construction activity due to the mild winter. Looking ahead, we expect GDP growth be somewhat weaker again in Q2 as some of the temporary supports for activity unwind, but we continue to expect a more sustained recovery in the second half of this year, supported by rising real incomes and easier financial conditions. Home prices across the US have continued to climb, despite Americans facing higher mortgage costs. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index shows that US house price rose by 6.4% in the year to February, up from 6% in January. Prices in the 10 largest cities jumped by 8% per year, up from 7.4%. “Following last year’s decline, U.S. home prices are at or near all-time highs,” says Brian D. Luke, Head of Commodities, Real &amp; Digital Assets at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. He explains: “Our National Composite rose by 6.4% in February, the fastest annual rate since November 2022. Our 10- and 20-City Composite indices are currently at all-time highs. For the third consecutive month, all cities reported increases in annual prices, with four currently at all-time highs: San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York. On a seasonal adjusted basis, our National, 10- and 20- City Composite indices continue to break through previous all-time highs set last year.” Over in the US, wages are rising faster than the country’s central bank would like. US wages and salaries increased by 1.1% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the two previous quarters. And in the 12 months to March, wages and salaries increased by 4.4%, and by 4.3% for private industry workers. The persistence of wage growth could encourage the US Federal Reserve to take its time on rate cuts. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, points out that productivity growth is an important factor: The big question is whether wage growth is low enough to be consistent with hitting the 2% price inflation target on a sustained basis? 4.3% is still well above the pre-Covid average, but productivity growth is also significantly higher. Property experts are hailing this morning’s news showing that UK mortgage approvals hit their highest for 18 months in March. Anthony Codling, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says rising mortgage approvals are good news for housebuilders: Given the recent increases in mortgage rates it was comforting to see mortgage approvals rise in March by 1.3% (seasonally adjusted) to 61,300, a level 20% higher than they were one year ago. We continue to believe that the UK housing market is slowly recovering even in the face of stubborn economic, mortgage rate headwinds, and election date uncertainty. But, there are also forecasts that the recovery will tail off, as borrowers are facing rising mortgage rates. Hina Bhudia, partner at Knight Frank Finance, says the recovery in housing market activity continued into March: At 61,300, mortgage approvals for house purchase are now approaching the 65,000 or so monthly approvals we saw during the three years leading up to the pandemic. “The market is currently dominated by buyers that really need to move, and that’s unlikely to change in the near-term. Mortgage rates are rising once again, and both Natwest and Santander raised rates on their product ranges this morning. “That will inevitably cause some would-be buyers to sit out this spring selling season, which should be gathering pace this week. The sun is out and buyers are returning from their Easter break, so we’d usually expect these to be the busy weeks before the summer, however the uncertain outlook for mortgage rates will undoubtedly weigh on activity. “It’s not just buyers that are frustrated. The lenders are eager to rebuild their businesses after a subdued 2023, however they are constrained by stubborn inflation and the resulting impact on their cost of funding.” Peter Arnold, EY UK chief economist, warns that mortgage rates are set to edge up further, as the impact of higher swap rates feeds through. That means the recovery in mortgage approvals will continue to cool, Arnold predicts: “The recovery in mortgage demand continued in March, with approvals for new house purchases rising to 61,325, an 18-month high. However, the increase in mortgage interest rates over recent months appears to have taken some of the momentum out of the recovery, with the rise in approvals between February and March being much smaller than the previous two months. Net mortgage lending slipped to just £0.3bn in March, from £1.6bn in February, but February’s outturn had been flattered by a temporary slump in repayments. “With swap rates having climbed further during April, and mortgage rates continuing to edge up in response, the EY ITEM Club expects the recovery in approvals to continue to cool in the near-term. Canada has joined the GDP party, but its growth figures are a bit of a damp squib. Canadian growth slowed in February, with GDP rising by 0.2% in February – weaker than the 0.3% expected – following a 0.5% gain in January. Statistics Canada says: Services-producing industries (+0.2%) led the growth for a second month in a row, fuelled by gains in transportation and warehousing. The goods-producing industries aggregate was essentially unchanged as the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector expanded while the utilities and manufacturing sectors contracted in February. Statistics Canada also estimates that Canada’s economy expanded 0.6% in the first quarter of 2024 – which would be twice as fast as the eurozone. The FTSE 100 share index has touched a new alltime high today, as its rally continues. The index of major blue-chip companies listed in London hit 8199.95 points for the first time today, above yesterday’s record high of 8189.14 points. Premier Inn owner Whitbread is the top riser, up 4.6%, after hiking its dividend, announcing a £150m share buyback plan and 1,500 job cuts. HSBC are also rallying, up 4% after beating profit forecasts this morning. Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index, says: The FTSE 100 is rising on Tuesday and is set to record its second straight month of gains, boosted by upbeat corporate earnings and despite mixed data from China. HSBC is up 2.5% after the bank posted better-than-expected pretax profits and announced a $3 billion share buyback, offsetting the news that CEO No Quinn will retire. The Asian-focused bank posted a 3% rise in revenue to $20.8 billion, well ahead of the $16.94 forecast. Pre-tax profit was $12.65 billion, down 2% annually, but still ahead of estimates. Adding to the good news, the British Retail Consortium noted that inflation was easing in the UK as shop prices rose at the slowest pace in more than two years in April. The data adds to signs that inflationary pressures are cooling, which could bring some relief to the Bank of England as policymakers consider when to start cutting interest rates. Heavyweight miners were in edging higher after Chinese factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in 14 months in April thanks to rising new export orders. In a busy day for growth data, Mexico’s economy has expanded by 0.2% in the last quarter, beating forecasts for stagnation. On an annual basis, though, growth slowed to 1.6% per year, missing forecasts of 2.1%: The fast-food restaurant business McDonald’s has missed sales forecasts as boycotts over war in the Middle East hit its takings. McDonald’s has reported that global sales rose by 1.9% in January-March, missing Wall Street’s forecast of a 2.1% increase. McDonald’s says that like-for-like sales in its international markets division were slightly negative, falling by 0.2%, as the segment “continued to be impacted by the war in the Middle East”. CEO Chris Kempczinski says: Our global comparable sales growth in the first quarter marks 13 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth with 30% growth over the last four years. As consumers are more discriminating with every dollar that they spend, we will continue to earn their visits by delivering leading, reliable, everyday value and outstanding execution in our restaurants. McDonald’s has been hit by boycotts across the Middle East and in Muslim-majority markets like Indonesia and Malaysia since October, AP reports, when its Israel franchise announced shortly after the Hamas attack of 7 October that it would be donating free meals to the Israeli military. McDonald’s took control of this franchise from Alonyal Ltd at the start of April. The eurozone has bounced back from its shallow technical recession after a stronger than expected performance by its “big four” economies in the first three months of 2024. After two successive quarters of 0.1% contraction in the second half of 2023, the 20 nations that use the single currency posted growth of 0.3% between January and March, my colleague Larry Elliott writes. Figures from the European Commission’s statistical agency – Eurostat – showed the eurozone had put in its best growth performance since the third quarter of 2022. Financial markets had been expecting 0.2% growth. Lower energy prices, falling inflation, rising real wages and the prospect of cuts in interest rates helped to boost activity after a downbeat 2023 in which the eurozone only grew in one quarter. More here. In the currency markets, Japan appears to have burned through $35bn supporting the yen yesterday. Bank of Japan data suggests Japanese officials may have spent some 5.5 trillion yen ($35.06bn) supporting the currency on Monday, Reuters flags. The intervention came after the yen dropped to a 34-year low of 160 yen to the dollar, and helped it strengthen back to around 155/$, Japanese officials have not said whether they intervened. The yen has dropped by around 11% against the US dollar this year. It has come under pressure even though the Bank of Japan raised interest rates out of negative territory in March. Traders are wagering that the BoJ will be cautious about raising interest rates higher, while the dollar is benefiting from bets that the US Federal Reserve will be cautious about cutting US rates this year. That is putting pressure on the yen. Anglo American’s chairman, Stuart Chambers, has assured shareholders over the company’s future resilience days after rejecting the £31bn takeover proposal from larger rival BHP. He told shareholders gathered for the company’s Annual General Meeting in London today that the board had unanimously agreed to oppose BHP’s “opportunistic” approach in the “clearest terms” because it undervalued the company. When questioned by one shareholder, Chambers said the UK’s takeover code meant the board would be unable to elaborate on its decision beyond the statement it released on Friday. “But I will be meeting with shareholders and listening very carefully, particularly [to] the larger ones in the top 30 of the register, to hear what they feel,” Chambers said. He added: “The board doesn’t buy or sell the company - the shareholders decide.” Back in the UK, more than 400 jobs are at risk as the consumer healthcare company Haleon plans to shut a manufacturing site in Berkshire. Haleon is planning to shut down its manufacturing site in Maidenhead by 2026, a move which will affect 435 jobs. That factory makes Haleon products such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Parodontax mouthwash. A Haleon spokesperson told Reuters: Following a strategic review of our global manufacturing capabilities, we have determined that our Maidenhead site is no longer a viable option for the manufacture of our products. The Guardian reported in July last year that Haleon was planning widespread layoffs in the UK and around the world, a year after being spun off from Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker GSK. The Eurozone economy exited stagnation “with a bang rather than a whimper”, says Moody’s Analytics’ senior economist Kamil Kovar. Kovar says the “almost normal above-consensus growth of 0.3%” could encourage the European Central Bank to take cautious approach to interest rate cuts: This confirms that 2024 will mark the long-postponed recovery in euro zone. However, it was not all cheers, with details showing some weakness beneath the strong headline figure: consumptions was still weak in many places, and only strong construction, driven by warm weather, and increase in net exports ensured the strong number. Still, the ECB hawks will point to the strong GDP number as argument that ECB can take its rates lower gradually. A June cut will still occur, but a further cut in July just became bit more unlikely.” There’s not much financial market reaction to the eurozone’s better-than-expected growth report. The euro has gained about 0.06% to $1.0725 against the US dollar against this morning. It’s gained 0.2% against the pound, dragging sterling down to €1.1694. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says: The euro is back above $1.0720 vs. the US dollar after stronger than expected European GDP for Q1. Quarterly GDP rose by 0.3%, which was stronger than the 0.1% expected, and ‘bounced’ back from the -0.1% dip in growth registered in Q4. Growth was broad-based across the currency bloc. However, southern European economies continue to outperform their Northern counterparts. But, this is unlikely to influence the European Central Bank, Brooks argues: The interest rate futures market is still expecting the ECB to cut rates in June, due to the April inflation print, which was in line with expectations at 2.4%. Core prices were slightly higher than expected at 2.7%, however this is still lower than the 2.9% recorded for March and the lowest level for nearly 2 years. German and French CPI also registered 2.4% annual CPI growth, which is within touching distance of the ECB’s 2% target. Today’s economic data out of the Eurozone point to an improving picture, reports Daniele Antonucci, chief investment officer at Quintet Private Bank: Looking at the change relative to the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the beat versus consensus exceeds the highest prediction in the key polls of forecasters. That’s the glass-half-full story, especially following the shallow recession the region has gone through in the second half of last year, though the caveat is that consumer spending across many European countries remains quite feeble. The glass-half-empty story is that the pace of growth remains rather anaemic, with the forward-looking indicators pointing to moderately positive economic conditions. The contrast with the US, where domestic demand looks resilient and GDP growth appears to be re-accelerating, is stark. This is important when prospects for the overall economy are seen in the context of the inflation data that is coming in. In the US, inflation has surprised to the upside lately. In the Eurozone, today’s data show a sideways trajectory for overall inflation, in line with expectations and lower in absolute terms than in the US. Although 0.3% quarterly growth isn’t exactly stellar, it’s the eurozone’s strongest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2022, early in Europe’s energy crisis. Bert Colijn, ING’s senior eurozone economist, says the eurozone economy has clearly entered a better phase with economic recovery, low unemployment and more moderate inflation. Lower energy prices, following the surge in oil and gas after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, are helping the economy. Colijn explains: The economy is profiting from a more stable energy supply, with costs having substantially eased, resulting in lower inflation. Wage growth, in turn, has accelerated to make up for lost purchasing power, which is currently benefiting consumers. We have yet to get the details, but judging from what’s happening in France, we see that household consumption led the way The eurozone is set to grow faster this year than in 2023, predicts Sam Miley, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research: This morning’s confirmation of quarterly growth in Q1 has put an end to a short-lived recession in the Eurozone, with the economy having turned a corner since the beginning of 2024. Prospects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by the expectation of interest rate cuts. Further data released this morning showed that inflation has now stood within one percentage point of target for seven consecutive months, suggesting a suitable environment for the European Central Bank to consider adopting looser monetary policy. Such policy changes will support growth this year. Cebr expects the Eurozone economy to expand by 0.6% in 2024, up from 2023’s growth figure of 0.4%. The eurozone economy is “moving along nicely”, says Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, following today’s GDP data. Inflation in the eurozone came in as expected but is proving to be stickier than might have been hoped for, mirroring experiences elsewhere. The economy is moving along nicely though, meaning that, all in all, the ECB will be able to stay on track to be the first of the major central banks to push the “cut” button on interest rates, probably in June. The prospects for the Eurozone are on the up, at a time when there is doubt creeping in for other economies’ prospects. Here’s Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, on today’s eurozone data: Inflation across the eurozone was unchanged in April. Eurostat reports that consumer price inflation was 2.4% per year, matching March’s reading. Services inflation did slow, to 3.7% from 4% in March, but food, alcohol &amp; tobacco inflation picked up to 2.8% from 2.6%. Non-energy industrial goods prices rose by 0.9%, down from 1.1%. Energy has less of a deflationary effect, though, with prices down by 0.6% year-on-year, from -1.8% in March. Disappointingly, core inflation fell by less than expected. Inflation, stripping out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, fell to 2.7% per year in April, down from 2.9%, but ahead of forecasts of a larger fall to 2.6%. NEWSFLASH: The eurozone has escaped recession, and beaten forecasts for growth at the start of this year. GDP across the eurozone expanded by 0.3% in January-March, statistics body Eurostat reports. This means the eurozone’s shallow recession is over – its GDP shrank by 0.1% in both the third and fourth quarters of last year, which was a technical recession. Eurozone growth has been held back by high interest rates, as the European Central Bank has battled inflation, while the cost of living crisis hit consumer spending. Euro area GDP was lifted by stronger-than-expected growth in Germany, France, Italy and Spain (as we’ve been blogging since early this morning). The wider European Union also grew by 0.3%. Eurostat says: Ireland (+1.1%) recorded the highest increase compared to the previous quarter, followed by Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary (all +0.8%). Sweden (-0.1%) was the only Member State that recorded a decrease compared to the previous quarter. The year on year growth rates were positive for nine countries and negative for four. France got the day off to a good start by reporting growth of 0.2% – which was hailed by its economy minister – before Spain posted a sizzling 0.7% growth. Germany then matched France, with 0.2% growth, while Italy expanded its GDP by 0.3%. In the UK, mortgage approvals are at their highest level since the chaos of Liz Truss’s mini-budget. New Bank of England data show that lenders approved 61,300 in March, up from 60,500 in February, which is the highest total since September 2022. There was also some relief for borrowers; the ‘effective’ interest rate – which is the actual interest paid – on newly drawn mortgages decreased by 17 basis points, to 4.73% in March. Getting back to eurozone GDP… and Portugal has grown as a steady pace at the start of this year. Portugal’s GDP grew by 0.7% in Q1 2024, the same rate as in Q4 2023, and was 1.4% larger than a year ago. Earlier this month, Portugal’s new centre-right government predicted the economy would grow 1.5% in 2024. It is planning to roll out tax cuts for the middle class in an effort to spur growth and investment. The German sportswear brand Adidas has benefited from a sales pick-up in Europe and China that helped it to overcome a slowdown in the US. Adidas has reported that sales in Europe increased by 14% in the last quarter, while they grew by 8% in Greater China, but fell by 4% in North America. Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden reported that sales, gross margin, and operating profit were all better than expected, and warned that “markets are still volatile and not easy”. Gulden adds: We now look forward to celebrate the great sports events like the Euro 2024, Copa América, the Olympics and Paralympics. It is a great year for sports – let us all enjoy it! Next stop, Italy – where growth has accelerated at the start of this year. Italian GDP grew by 0.3% in January-March, statistics body ISTAT reports, comfortably ahead of forecasts of 0.1% growth. That’s the third quarter of growth in a row, although Italy’s economy was only 0.6% larger than a year ago. ISTAT says: The quarter on quarter change is the result of an increase of value added in agriculture, forestry and fishing, in that of industry and in services. From the demand side, there is a negative contribution by the domestic component (gross of change in inventories) and a positive one by the net export component. Last month, revised data showed that Italy had actually achieved the best recovery of any major European economy over the last four years. Carsten Brzeski, ING’s global head of macro, has welcomed Germany’s GDP report – saying it proves that its economy can still grow. Brzeski says: Just as some German children have been asking their parents whether they remember a time when the economy was actually growing, the first estimate of 1Q GDP growth came in at 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, from a downwardly revised -0.5% QoQ in the fourth quarter. On the year, the German economy was still down by 0.2% when corrected for working days. There are no estimates for the GDP components but judging by the available monthly data, growth in the first quarter was mainly driven by the construction sector and net exports. Brzeski is also confident that Germany’s economic cycle has started to turn for the better, after some tough quarters. He says: The words ‘optimism’ and ‘German economy’ together in one sentence have been a rarity for a long while. However, for a few weeks now, optimism has returned to the German economy. Today’s GDP growth data is almost just the natural next step of stronger sentiment indicators and a pick-up in activity since the start of the year. Here comes the big one, Germany’s GDP report… And Europe’s largest economy has returned to growth! German GDP expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2024, the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) reports, beating expectations of 0.1% growth. Destatis says this “modest growth” was due to an increase in gross fixed capital formation in construction and in exports, while household consumption fell. This follows a deeper-than-first-thought contraction at the end of laast year. Destasis reports that Germany shrank by 0.5% in Q4 2023, worst than the 0.3% previously estimated. The number of people out of work in Germany rose more than expected in April, Reuters reports. Federal Labour Office figures this morning show that the number of unemployed grew by 10,000 in seasonally adjusted terms. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected that figure to rise by 9,000. The Czech Republic grew faster than forecast in the first quarter of this year – continuing the theme of the morning! Czech GDP rose by 0.5% in January-March, beating forecasts of 0.4% growth. Growth was driven by domestic demand, including higher spending by households and investment by businesses. Vladimír Kermiet, Director of the National Accounts Department of the Czech Statistical Office (CZSO), says: The total final consumption expenditure and an increasing external trade balance contributed to the year-on-year growth. Conversely, a decrease in gross capital formation continued. As the Czech Republic isn’t in the eurozone, this won’t help euro area GDP (due at 10am UK time), but it’s another sign that the European economy is growing this year. On an annual basis, the Czech economy was 0.4% larger than a year ago. Austria’s growth figures are also stronger than expected. Austrian GDP expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter of this year, better than the 0.1% which economists forecast. This is the first increase in GDP in a year, after the economy shrank by 1.3% in the second quarter of 2023, by 0.3% in Q3 2023, and then stagnated in Q4 last year. Growth was driven by private consumer demand, while Austria’s industrial economy remained weak and |”almost stagnated”, think tank WIFO reports, while investment demand declined again. Separately, inflation in Austria has fallen to an average of 3.5% in April, its lowest level since September 2021. Just in: Spain’s economy has grown faster than forecast. Spanish GDP rose by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, new data from statistics body INS showed. That’s rather faster than the 0.4% growth which economists had expected – an encouraging sign, especially after France grew faster than forecast (see earlier post). INS also revised up Spain’s growth in Q4 2023, to 0.7% from 0.6%. On an annual basis, Spain’s economy grew by 2.4%, mostly driven by “national demand”, with “external demand” contributing 0.2 points. This stronger-than-forecast growth should cheer Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, who yesterday announced he would stay on as PM despite a “harassment and bullying operation” being waged against him and his wife by his political and media enemies. German carmaker Volkswagen has revealed that its operating profits slumped by a fifth in the first quarter of this year. Europe’s top automaker was hit by lower sales and higher costs, but is sticking to its revenue and margin targets for 2024. Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen’s CFO and COO, says the results “show a slow start to the year”, but he insists that new models will help the company this year: A strong March, the solid order bank and the improving order intake in the past months are encouraging and should already have a positive impact in the second quarter. We expect additional momentum over the course of the year from the launch of more than 30 new models across all brands. Volkswagen’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) dropped by 20% to €4.6bn, while sales were down 2%. French inflation has slowed, despite a pick-up in energy prices. France’s consumer price index rose by 2.2% per year in April, statistics body INSEE estimates, down from 2.3% in March. The decrease was partly due to a slowdown in the price rises of food (1.2%) and tobacco (9%), and also to a slight drop (-0.1%) in the cost of manufactured goods. However, energy inflation rose to 3.8% from 3.4% in March, while services inflation stuck at 3%. France’s economy minister has hailed today’s news that the French economy grew more than expected in the first quarter. Bruno Le Maire declared that the government’s strategy was working, after GDP rose by 0.2% in January-March. Le Maire says: “To all those who want us to believe that our economy is at a standstill: facts are stubborn. French growth is progressing. “This is a new sign showing the solidity of our economy,…[the] government’s strategy is paying off.” This is the second piece of good news to drop into Le Maire’s inbox in a week. Two major credit-rating agencies, Moody’s and Fitch, left France’s rating unchanged last Friday, despite concerns about its large national debt and deteriorating public finances. Hungary has returned to growth, in an encouraging sign for Eastern Europe’s economy. Hungary’s gross domestic product grew by 0.8% in the first quarter of this year, new data shows, having previously stagnated with 0% growth in the last quarter of 2023. Growth was driven by market services, such as real estate activities as well as information and communication, while the industrial sector shrank. Hotel firm Whitbread, which operates in the UK and Germany, is axing 1,500 jobs in a cost-cutting plan…. and boosting returns to shareholders. Whitbread has today announced a new efficiency programme which will deliver £150m of cost savings over the next three years. It says: The plan we are announcing today will result in the reduction of around 1,500 roles out of a total UK workforce of 37,000. While these plans are still subject to consultation, we will seek to find alternative opportunities wherever possible through the roles created by this plan and our existing recruitment process that makes c.15,000 hires each year. We expect to retain a significant proportion of those affected who wish to remain with us and we will be providing dedicated support to our teams. Whitbread announced the plan alongside its latest financial results, which show revenues rose 13% in the last financial year, while pre-tax profits grew 21%. Its Premier Inn Germany division grew its sales by 62%, while its losses narrowed to £36m from £50m. Whitbread investors can look forward to higher returns; the company’s board is recommending a 26% increase in the final dividend to 62.9p per share. It also plans to start a new £150m share buy-back (exactly the amount it intends to save through cost-cutting!), to run through the first half of this financial year. We haev encouraging economic news from Germany too, where consumer spending has risen faster than expected. German retail sales grew by 1.8% in March, beating forecasts of 1.1% growth, and largely reversing the 1.9% drop recorded in February. The broader picture is that France’s economy has only grown modestly over the last nine months. The 0.2% rise in GDP in January-March reported this morning follows two quarters of 0.1% growth. Newsflash: France’s economic growth has accelerated in the first quarter of this year, beating expectations. In an encouraging start to eurozone GDP day, French GDP expanded by 0.2% in January-March, a pick-up on the 0.1% growth recorded in October-December. Economists had only expected growth of 0.1%, so this may bolster hopes that the eurozone has returned to growth. Household spending helped drive the French economy, statistics body INSEE says, with final domestic demand bouncing back and contributing 0.4 percentage points to growth. But foreign trade’s contribution to GDP growth fell to zero, with imports rising by 0.2% and exports up by 0.5%. There’s big news in the banking sector this morning: HSBC’s chief executive officer Noel Quinn is unexpectedly stepping down after nearly 5 years in the job. The board has begun a formal process to find a successor, firing the starting gun to find a replacement at Europe’s largest bank. Quinn is stepping back after leading a series of strategic reviews, boosting HSBC’s investment in its Asian business while cutting back on other markets such as France and the US. Looking ahead, Quinn explains why he’s stepping down: “After an intense five years, it is now the right time for me to get a better balance between my personal and business life. I intend to pursue a portfolio career going forward.” Quinn was appointed CEO in March 2020, after a stint as interim chief executive, and steered the bank through the Covid-19 pandemic. He also faced pressure from major shareholder Ping An to separate out its Asian business. There’s good news for UK shoppers this morning – prices are rising at their slowest rate since late 2021 this month, with non-food goods actually cheaper than a year ago. Deep discounts by clothing and footwear retailers put the brakes on inflation, the latest snapshot of high street spending trends has shown. The monthly bulletin from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) – the lobby group for the industry – found that the battle by store owners to offload summer stock in cold and wet weather meant prices in non-food stores were lower this month than a year earlier. The BRC said the cost of non-food goods fell at an annual rate of 0.6% in April, while the price of food increased by 3.4%, down from 3.7% in March. Taken together, food and non-food inflation stood at 0.8% in April, compared to 1.3% in the year to March – the lowest level since December 2021. More here: We already have some idea how the eurozone fared in the first quarter of this year, as Ireland and Belgium both released growth data yesterday. Ireland’s GDP rose by an impressive-sounding 1.1%. in January-March, led by a rebound in its tech sector. That means Ireland’s technical recession has ended, after its GDP shrank through 2023, including a 3.4% contraction in October-December 2023. GDP isn’t a great way of measuring Ireland’s economy, though, as the data is distorted by multinational companies based in the Republic. Belgium’s data was altogether calmer – its GDP expanded by 0.3% in January-March, for the fourth quarter in a row. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The eurozone economy is in the spotlight today with new growth figures, and inflation data, being released across the single currency bloc. Having been held back by high interest rates, and the cost of living squeeze, economists are hoping the eurozone returned to growth in the first quarter of this year. Analysts predict that eurozone GDP grew by 0.1% in January-March quarter. That would pull the region out of a shallow recession, after it contracted by 0.1% in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Analysts at Investec are hopeful that we’ll see some growth in the eurozone: Focus will also be on the inflation outlook in the Eurozone, with flash HICP for April due on Tuesday. This will be released at the same time as Q1 GDP. Recent revisions now mean that the Eurozone was in a technical recession in H2, albeit by the slimmest of margins. Given that economic data at the start of 2024 has been more positive, we expect the Eurozone exited that recession in Q1, with a 0.1% quarterly expansion in output. Inflation is expected to remain unchanged at 2.4% in April, while core inflation could slip to 2.6% from 2.9%. Easing inflationary pressures could leave the European Central Bank free to start cutting interest rates in June – especially if growth were to disappoint… Also coming up today Frankly, it could be a monster day for news. For starters, new post-Brexit charges on imports of EU food and plant products into Britain begin today. Fees of up to £145 will apply to small imports of animal products and plants, such as sausages, cheese and yoghurt, entering the UK from the EU through the port of Dover and through Eurotunnel at Folkestone. A flurry of big name companies are reporting financial results today; we’ll hear from Whitbread, Glencore, Prudential, St James’s Place and Howdens, while HSBC has just reported a small (1.5%) dip in profits for the last quarter, to $12.7bn.

        "title": "Nationwide stops lending on some flood-risk properties",
        "content": "Britain’s biggest building society has stopped granting mortgages on some properties where there is a high risk of flooding but said this affected only “a very limited number” of homes. Nationwide’s head of property risk, Rob Stevens, said the lender used mapping technology to identify which homes were vulnerable to flooding, and it would decline to grant a mortgage to buy a property it deemed to be at high risk. His comments in an interview with Bloomberg could spark renewed debate about what will happen when the UK government’s subsidised flood insurance scheme ends in 15 years’ time. A fortnight ago it emerged that UK weather-related home insurance claims had hit a new record, with flooding accounting for half of last year’s £573m total bill. Some big mortgage lenders, including Barclays and NatWest, have previously made clear they will still grant mortgages for properties where there is judged to be a high risk of flooding, provided that adequate home insurance is in place. However, a former Barclays chief executive has warned that “further consideration would need to be given” regarding the suitability of granting mortgages on high-risk properties in future years, particularly once the official Flood Re subsidised cover scheme ends in 2039. HSBC has said it was “critical” that Flood Re was extended. Stevens told the Guardian that “there will be rare occasions where we are unable to lend due to the associated risk of lending on a specific property”. But he added that Nationwide continued to lend on properties that were designated as flood risks, and that it had not pulled any mortgage offers. All its checks around flooding were done before an offer was made, so that the borrower was aware upfront. Nationwide said that, like all home loan providers, it needed to lend responsibly and therefore there would be some properties it could not grant mortgages on, “albeit when it comes to flooding, this is only on a very limited number”. Bloomberg reported Stevens saying that, “if we’re doing a 40-year mortgage term and there’s something there that I know could fundamentally change for the customer, I can’t not know that”, adding that he had personally phoned some buyers to warn them that their prospective homes were at high risk of flooding. However, Stevens told the Guardian that, “in the overwhelming majority of cases” it was able to lend on homes even where issues had been identified, assuming that mitigating factors had been put in place – for example, flood defences. Nationwide did not provide details of how many homes might be affected. Policies in this area will vary from lender to lender. In a letter to MPs last year, Matt Hammerstein, formerly chief executive of Barclays UK and now head of its UK corporate bank, said: “Barclays does not have a policy that restricts the availability of mortgages to borrowers in flood-risk areas – we lend irrespective of the flood-risk band.” Restrictions on lending would only arise because a borrower was unable, or unwilling, to obtain home insurance. Meanwhile, NatWest last year told MPs that “we do not exclude lending in any flood-risk areas”. A jump in weather-related home insurance claims last year was fuelled by a succession of storms, including Babet, Ciaran and Debi. Those who live in areas with a high risk of flooding may be able to access insurance through Flood Re, which is a joint initiative between the government and insurers offering subsidised insurance to households at the highest risk of flooding in order to make cover more affordable. Looking at disclosed data, Barclays revealed in February that just over 90% of the properties in its UK mortgage portfolio were judged to be either in a “negligible,” “very low” or “low” flood-risk band, with 1.6%judged to be in the moderate risk band, and 2.6% and 1.2% in the high-risk and very-high-risk bands.",

        "title": "‘It’s pretty gloomy out there’: new NFU chief Tom Bradshaw fights to give food producers a better deal",
        "content": "‘This is the first time I’ve had my lawn cut by somebody else,” says Tom Bradshaw, the new president of the National Farmers’ Union. Just over a month after being voted into the role, he admits life has become “hectic”. He is standing outside the idyllic farmhouse in rural Essex where he has lived since he was six, and the garden is all perfect flower beds and newly manicured grass. Nothing here looks hectic, but Bradshaw really is a busy man. As well as his NFU duties, he grows wheat, barley and oats on the family farm near Colchester, and also owns an equestrian centre and a contracting business that manages four nearby farms – although he admits he has stepped back from day-to-day tasks in recent years. He also has two children, aged six and five. Easter saw him juggling holiday childcare while tussling with the government over flooding support. Just days after ministers announced a flood recovery plan for those hit by January’s Storm Henk, the NFU publicly attacked the decision to limit support to farms less than 150 metres from named rivers. “We tried to sort this out behind closed doors,” says Bradshaw, who clearly prefers the diplomatic route. The government bowed to pressure and removed the restrictions but Bradshaw believes the scheme, which is limited to certain rivers, is still not enough. “We want to work with Defra to make sure money goes to those most impacted,” he says. “There shouldn’t be a geographical limit.” Henk is one of 11 named storms to have hit the UK since September 2023. The country has just had its wettest 18 months since records began in 1836, and farms have borne the brunt. Many were left underwater for months at a time, unable to plant or harvest crops, puting them under huge financial pressure. Bradshaw hasn’t been spared: he lost 15% of his wheat crop this year because of the rain. But he is one of the lucky ones. He reads a message from an NFU member saying the floods have put him close to “jacking it in” and “raising the white flag”. Bradshaw adds: “Markets have collapsed, wheat, barley, rape, obviously. Many people didn’t get crops planted, and of those that did, 40% are in poor condition. It’s a pretty gloomy picture out there.” For him, protecting farmers is crucial to the country’s food security in an increasingly uncertain world. The UK produces 60% by value of the food it consumes. It is largely self sufficient in grains, and production of meat, milk and eggs is equivalent to consumption (though some high-value products are imported). But the numbers are lower for vegetables (50%) and fruit (16%). At February’s NFU conference, Rishi Sunak told farmers “I’ve got your back”, because food security was a priority. Measures included a new annual food security index, and grants worth £427m. So does Bradshaw think the government has a plan for food security? “No. I hear that food production has risen up the political agenda. I believe it has, but it’s easy to deliver the words: it’s the policies we need.” Bradshaw thinks retailers and supermarkets could do more, too. He points to recent shortages of products such as eggs and salad as a direct result of retailers ignoring farmers’ needs. “We ran out of eggs in this country because the retailers wouldn’t heed the warning that there wasn’t a viable return for members to reinvest in their businesses,” he says. The relationship between farmers and supermarkets is one of interdependence and tension. Bradshaw says farmers are at “breaking point”, with retailers asking them to meet an increasing list of requirements that are not imposed on their overseas competitors. “We are asking for core standards to be implemented within imports that match the standards of production here,” he says. “At the moment it feels like they want everything at the minimum cost.” But these aren’t the only pressures on the industry. Delays to the rollout of sustainable farming incentive (SFI) payments – the subsidies brought in to replace the EU’s basic payment scheme (BPS) subsidies – have left many farmers out of pocket. Bradshaw, who voted to remain in the EU, admits however that this picture is improving slightly, with more than 17,000 farmers signed up. There have also been much-publicised protests against a Welsh government scheme under which farmers have to give more than 20% of their land for trees and wildlife habitat in exchange for the new payment. Bradshaw says this system will not work in its current form. So with all these headwinds, who would be a farmer? It is clearly a subject Bradshaw feels passionately about. When he talks about there now being 7,000 fewer farming businesses than in 2019, his voice breaks. “We can’t let this continue,” he says, clearly emotional. We are sitting metres away from the former milking parlour where a six-year-old Bradshaw used to help his father (who still works on the farm). “Farming is just something I always wanted to do,” he says. After graduating from agricultural college in Kent, he came back to the family farm a few miles north-west of Colchester. “When I came home, aged 21,” he says, “my dad more or less handed over the chequebook and said, ‘Here you go.’” Since then he has expanded the farm contracting business and moved away from dairy farming, converting the former dairy buildings into a riding school. So, does he want his children to be farmers? “My ambition here is to have a rural farm business that they have the choice to get involved in if they want to,” he says. Voted in as president in February after two years as deputy president, he replaced the popular and plain-speaking Minette Batters, who once accused former environment minister Thérèse Coffey of being “asleep at the wheel”. Bradshaw is effusive about the job Batters did, but says he “can’t look to be Minette”. He also thinks the political landscape has changed since she was first president: the NFU often had to act like the opposition under Batters’s reign, because the opposition could be “so poor”. “I don’t think we need to be that political now [...] We are in different times now and we will work constructively with whoever is in power,” he says. He believes the rural vote is now up for grabs, saying members will be looking closely at all of the party manifestos. A recent Deltapoll survey suggested that the rural vote, which has been Conservative traditionally, could be moving to Labour. It found that in the 100 biggest farming constituencies, Tory support had dropped from 58% to 32%, with Labour on 36%. For now, though, it is the current government Bradshaw has to deal with. His afternoon will involve going out to bat for his 45,000-plus members in a call with environment minister Steve Barclay. And after that? A more traditional kind of batting: Bradshaw will make time for a game of cricket in the garden with his son. Executive summary Age 41 Family Married to Emily and two children aged six and five.

        "title": "Eurozone exits recession as ‘big four’ economies beat forecasts",
        "content": "The eurozone has bounced back from its shallow technical recession after a stronger than expected performance by its “big four” economies in the first three months of 2024. After two successive quarters of 0.1% contraction in the second half of 2023, the 20 nations that use the single currency posted growth of 0.3% between January and March. Figures from the European Commission’s statistical agency – Eurostat – showed the eurozone had put in its best growth performance since the third quarter of 2022. Financial markets had been expecting 0.2% growth. Lower energy prices, falling inflation, rising real wages and the prospect of cuts in interest rates helped to boost activity after a downbeat 2023 in which the eurozone only grew in one quarter. Europe’s two biggest economies – Germany and France – grew by 0.2%, while Italy and Spain posted growth of 0.3% and 0.7% respectively. Germany’s performance in the final three months of 2023 was worse than originally thought: the economy contracted by 0.5% rather than 0.3%. Of the smaller EU economies, the best performing were Ireland, which grew by 1.1% in the first three months of 2024, and Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary, which expanded by 0.8%. Separate Eurostat data showed headline eurozone inflation remained unchanged in April at 2.4%, while core inflation – which excludes energy and food – came down from 2.9% to 2.7%. Although the eurozone’s growth performance in the first quarter was stronger than the European Central Bank had been forecasting, analysts said lower inflation paved the way for interest rate cuts in the months ahead. Sam Miley, the managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: “This morning’s confirmation of quarterly growth in the first quarter has put an end to a short-lived recession in the eurozone, with the economy having turned a corner since the beginning of 2024. “Prospects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by the expectation of interest rate cuts.” Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: “While the eurozone’s mild recession appears to be over, we think the economy will expand at only a moderate pace over the rest of the year.” Some of the improvement in the first three months of 2024 was due to temporary factors, such as a rebound in construction, while business surveys also pointed to sluggish growth, Kenningham said. UK first quarter growth figures are due out next week, with the financial markets anticipating 0.3% growth and an end to the mild recession recorded in the second half of 2023. Figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals for house purchases rose from 60,500 in February to 61,300 in March, taking them to the highest level since September 2022. The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee will make its latest decision on interest rates next week, but is expected to leave official borrowing costs unchanged at 5.25%. • This article was amended on 1 May 2024.

        "title": "HSBC chief Noel Quinn to step down after ‘intense’ five years",
        "content": "The chief executive of HSBC, Noel Quinn, is unexpectedly stepping down after an “intense” five years in the role, as the bank reported better-than-expected profits. Europe’s largest bank has kicked off a search for a successor and said Quinn, 62, will stay in the post until a new chief executive is found. It is looking at both internal and external candidates. Quinn is an HSBC veteran who joined the bank in 1987. The London-based lender reported an 1.8% drop in pre-tax profit to $12.7bn (£10.1bn) in the first three months of 2024, better than analysts had forecast. Revenues increased by 3% to $20.8bn. HSBC said it would buy back up to $3bn of its shares. Quinn became chief executive, initially on an interim basis, when John Flint was ousted in 2019 after just 18 months. He immediately had to navigate the bank through the pandemic after being made permanent in March 2020, and slashed 35,000 jobs to save £3.5bn a year. Under his leadership, the board fended off demands from top shareholder Ping An to split off HSBC’s Asian business. Quinn said: “After an intense five years, it is now the right time for me to get a better balance between my personal and business life.” He added that he would “take a breather” and spend some time with his extended family, and would consider other opportunities once “I’ve had a rest”. Quinn’s pay roughly doubled to £10.6m last year, when HSBC reported record profits. He has spent 37 years at HSBC, starting his career at Midland Bank and various subsidiaries, and ran its global commercial banking business from 2015. “I would never have dreamed of being the CEO of this bank 37 years ago, and it’s a privilege,” he said. He added: “I think it’s right for me but I also think it’s right for the bank. The next phase of the journey, continuing to grow and develop the business is a multi-year phase, and it’s right to hand that challenge, that opportunity on to the next leader.” The HSBC chair, Mark Tucker, said it was Quinn’s decision to retire. He added: “He has driven both our transformation strategy and created a simpler, more focused business that delivers higher returns”. Quinn has revamped HSBC in recent years, selling off its retail banking businesses in France, the US, Canada and most recently Argentina to sharpen its focus on Asia, where the bank makes most of its profits. Quinn, who supports Aston Villa football club, joked that the only point of difference between him and Tucker over the past five years had been over football, as Tucker is “an ardent Chelsea supporter”. Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said: “It’s a surprise to see Noel Quinn announce plans to step down as chief executive of HSBC. It felt like he was on a roll with efforts to simplify the group and improve returns. “He is getting out while the going is good, destined to be seen as the man who fixed HSBC and positioning himself as a go-to person for strategic advice.” HSBC’s net interest income, the difference in loan charges compared with what is paid out to savers, fell by $300m to $8.7bn as some customers moved their accounts. Non-interest income increased by $900m, reflecting a rise in trading income of $1.3bn, mainly in global banking and markets. The bank wants to take advantage of the UK’s decision to scrap the banker bonus cap, which was introduced after the 2008 financial crisis and limited bonuses at twice an individual’s base salary. HSBC needs to change its own corporate rules to be able to pay out larger bonuses and is asking shareholders to approve the changes at its annual meeting on Friday. Quinn said: “We haven’t yet determined the full detail of this implementation. But we wanted to at least get the flexibility to reflect more in variable pay the performance of the bank, and that hasn’t been possible with the two-for-one cap.” Shareholder approval would allow HSBC to pay out much larger bonuses to its executives and hundreds of its most highly paid bankers, who are referred to as “material risk takers”.",

        "title": "Premier Inn owner Whitbread to cut 1,500 jobs and shut 100-plus restaurants",
        "content": "The Premier Inn owner Whitbread is to cut 1,500 jobs in the UK and shut more than 100 struggling restaurants despite announcing a significant rise in returns to shareholders. Whitbread, which runs 850 hotels in the UK and has the sector’s biggest brand, Premier Inn, said it was starting a consultation on the cuts on Tuesday and that it would seek to find alternative jobs for those affected. The move is part of a £150m three-year cost-cutting drive that will slim down its 37,000-member workforce. It has also begun a process to sell 126 restaurants. The job cuts are in stark contrast to buoyant figures delivered to the City on Tuesday. The company’s sales rose 13% to nearly £3bn in the year to 29 February, and adjusted profit before tax climbed 36% to £561m. Whitbread raised its final dividend for each share by 26% to 62.9p and was planning a further £150m share buyback. Its shares rose 0.5% on the news. Dominic Paul, the chief executive, said demand had been slower in the seven weeks to 18 April, partly because of the earlier timing of Easter. He added that midweek room bookings by business travellers had been “really resilient” while weekend demand had not been as strong, which meant total hotel revenues were 1% behind the full-year results. Paul said there was still strong demand for rooms this summer from those attending events such as Taylor Swift concerts and the Goodwood motor sports festival in July. The company’s summer holiday bookings are also ahead of last year and some coastal towns, such as Newquay, have sold out early. The company has embarked on a £500m investment plan that includes adding 3,500 new hotel rooms at Premier Inn in the UK to its current 80,000, and building more restaurants inside its hotels. It said 387 of its hotels had integrated restaurants while others had a restaurant next door, run either by Whitbread or another operator. As part of the plan, Whitbread plans to sell 126 unprofitable Beefeater and Brewers Fayre restaurants, with 21 sales already agreed, but intends to keep 196 mainly larger restaurants adjacent to hotels. It will close 112 restaurants and convert the space into new hotel rooms. “We are materially bigger than we were pre-pandemic,” said Paul, while other smaller hotel operators had to shut permanently because of the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns. “With interest rates still pretty high, developers are struggling to develop sites and our competitors are struggling to get new sites. We will have more rooms in our future pipeline in the UK than all of our key competitors put together.” In Germany, where Premier Inn has 59 hotels, the company wants to become the biggest hotel brand and is on track to break even this year, after a loss of £36m for last year despite sales growth of 62%.",

        "title": "Risks of Thames Water crisis contagion look overdone | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "The contagion merchants are out in force at Thames Water. If the country’s biggest water company goes under, runs the argument from assorted bondholders and City bankers, we will all pay a price. Other water companies will pay more for their capital, shoving the cost on to our bills eventually, and the burned bondholders will exact revenge when they’re asked to finance everything from electricity pylons to nuclear power stations. Should we be scared? Before everybody works themselves into a panic, it would be better to wait until 12 June, the day when the water regulator, Ofwat, gives its first view on the business plans of English and Welsh companies for the next five-year period, and says what level of bill increases it will accept and what assumptions it has made about the cost of capital. That is the first point at which the “contagion” noise can be properly assessed. This column’s bet is that Ofwat’s proposals, for the whole industry, will be soft. In other words, the companies will be given terms that are seen as generous (to them) by historical standards. Why? Well, every five-year price review involves a trade-off between competing objectives, notably the desire to keep consumers’ bills down and the need to ensure investment in infrastructure happens. This time, the priority is obviously to accelerate investment to clean up the polluted waterways. Bills are going up significantly, the question is the degree. Since Ofwat does not live in a bubble (whatever Thames’s shareholders might believe), it is probably also fair to assume it has noticed that interest rates have risen and there is international competition for capital these days. That’s another reason to expect a soft-ish settlement. If that is how things turn out on 12 June, don’t expect water company bosses to jump with glee – they always roll around in agony and claim the regulator has been uniquely harsh. But, when the numbers have been digested, a perfectly plausible scenario might see eight or nine of the 10 big firms declare they can live with Ofwat’s proposals and will be able access capital at reasonable rates on the back of it. A likely outlier would be Thames, of course, since its shareholders have already said they think Ofwat has made the firm “uninvestable”. But if most of Thames’s peers are simultaneously saying the regulator’s numbers add up, where is the contagion risk meant to lie? Thames would be seen as an isolated case: a company that borrowed far too much, managed its operations badly, got caught out by the rise in interest rates and then couldn’t keep up with the rest of the industry. Nobody pretends that recapitalising Thames would be straightforward, but the basic principles aren’t complicated. Shareholders get wiped out, and then bondholders take the pain until the debt is reduced to a point at which newly arriving lenders can see a credible proposition. It’s anybody’s guess today where that point lies until Ofwat speaks. But would an overall 20% haircut, say, for lenders who have advanced £15bn to the regulated entity really cause an earthquake in the rest of UK infrastructure-land? Probably not if the rest of the UK water sector was getting on with raising capital. The picture, admittedly, would look different if Ofwat’s five-year terms in June are regarded as genuinely tough. In that case, the contagion crew may have a point. But it is not today’s position. The share prices of the publicly listed United Utilities and Severn Trent have drifted slightly during the Thames kerfuffle, but not by much. In the wings, the US hedge fund Elliott Management was reported by the FT to be buying Thames debt at a discount to face value on the expectation that losses for bondholders won’t be severe. That development sounds like a sign that, far from believing the end is nigh for all UK infrastructure, financial markets are treating Thames like a special case and assessing how a much-needed financial reconstruction would work. Yes, it could all change again in June. In the meantime, government ministers need to hold their nerve. The market has had years to work out that Thames was a bad risk. If its bondholders were asleep, that’s on them.",

The monthly bulletin from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) – the lobby group for the industry – found that the battle by store owners to offload summer stock in cold and wet weather meant prices in non-food stores were lower this month than a year earlier. The BRC said the cost of non-food goods fell at an annual rate of 0.6% in April, while the price of food increased by 3.4%, down from 3.7% in March. Taken together, food and non-food inflation stood at 0.8% in April, compared to 1.3% in the year to March – the lowest level since December 2021. Data for the BRC’s shop price bulletin was collected early in the month and points to another fall in the official inflation figure for April when it is released next month. Inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022 – the highest level in four decades – but has since been on a downward trend. In the year to March, the Office for National Statistics said prices rose by 3.2%, but the Bank of England expects lower energy bills to bring the annual inflation rate down to about 2% in April. Despite the easing of cost-of-living pressures, food prices are 25% higher than they were when Russia invaded Ukraine just over two years ago, while prices overall have increased by 14%. Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said shop price inflation levels were showing signs of normalising. She added: “Both food and non-food have seen shop inflation rates ease to more manageable levels. In April, non-food prices fell, especially in clothing and footwear, where retailers ramped up promotions to encourage consumer spend. “Food inflation slowed for the 12th consecutive month as fresh products, such as butter, fish and fruits, continued to fall in price due to easing input costs and intense competition between grocers.” Amid warnings from farmers that months of wet weather could lead to food shortages and higher prices, Dickinson said geo-political tension also posed a threat to price stability. “Retailers will continue to do all they can to keep prices down, but government has a role to play with pro-growth policies that allow businesses to invest in the customer offer,” she added.",

        "title": "Mining firm BHP offers $25.7bn settlement for Brazil dam disaster",
        "content": "The mining company BHP has said it hopes to secure a $25.7bn (£20bn) settlement over the 2015 Samarco disaster, when the collapse of a dam left at least 19 people dead, 700 homeless and spread unprecedented levels of pollutants across the rivers and landscape of Brazil. BHP said it had offered the settlement to the Brazilian authorities in partnership with fellow miner Vale, its 50:50 joint venture partner in a local subsidiary, Samarco. The Fundão dam, owned by Samarco, collapsed on 5 November 2015, releasing a deluge of mining waste near Mariana, in the Minas Gerais region of Brazil. The accident also began a long series of legal claims against BHP, the Australian mining company which had its primary stock market listing in London at the time of the disaster. The world’s largest mining company said that it and Vale had put forward a proposal worth a total of 127bn Brazilian reals (£19.9bn), although some of that sum has already been paid. Under the terms of the proposal, the two companies would agree to pay $14.4bn over the course of “well in excess” of a decade, to Brazilian national, regional and municipal governments. They would also fund a further $3.6bn in compensation and clean-up efforts via the Renova Foundation, which was set up in the wake of the disaster. The remainder of the settlement, $7.7bn, has already been spent via the foundation, including $3.5bn that has gone directly to about 430,000 affected people. The proposal by BHP and Vale would wrap together existing agreements with Brazilian authorities with outstanding claims by various government bodies in a single settlement. BHP, the world’s largest mining company, moved its primary stock market listing to Australia in 2022. But at the time of the accident its main listing was in London, where its annual meetings were visited by protestors. They were demanding greater compensation for a disaster that unleashed the largest spill of tailings – mining waste – in history. BHP announced its settlement proposal to investors after speculation in the Brazilian press. It said: “The negotiations between the parties are ongoing and no final agreement has been reached on the settlement amount or terms.” Last week, the London-listed mining company Anglo American rejected a “highly unattractive” £31bn takeover approach from BHP.",

        "content": "The grocery courier firm Getir is to quit the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and the US to focus on its home market of Turkey amid heavy competition and waning demand for rapid home deliveries. The closure marks the latest shakeout of the fast grocery delivery industry which grew rapidly during the Covid pandemic but has sharply retreated since. It is not clear how many jobs are affected. In late 2021 the group had 1,500 employees in the UK, according to accounts filed at Companies House, most of whom were likely to be delivery riders. However, the group has since ceased operating in several British cities including Liverpool and Birmingham. The latest retreat comes after Getir cut 2,500 jobs – more than a tenth of its workforce – last year. The company pulled out of France, Spain, Italy and Portugal as the cost of living crisis dampened demand for grocery deliveries in less than 20 minutes, while its own costs have also gone up. Getir said it would retain its US arm FreshDirect – only bought a few months ago – and said the closures only affected 7% of sales. Set up in 2015, Getir grew into one of the largest of more than a dozen delivery app companies, promising to deliver groceries in minutes and offering hefty discounts to attract customers. However, most of its rivals have been sold or closed down. Those that remain have tightened their operations, laying off riders and selling warehouses. Getir bought its German rival Gorillas in a $1.2bn (£960m) deal in 2022 after snapping up the UK’s Weezy a year earlier. The smaller London-based firm Jiffy ceased deliveries in 2022 while the US operator Gopuff bought Fancy and Dija, both UK companies, in 2021. Getir was valued at up to $11.8bn when it raised funds in March 2022, but its valuation was slashed to $6.5bn in a funding round in April last year. The market continues to be highly competitive: the takeaway delivery firms Deliveroo, JustEat and Uber Eats have tied up with supermarkets to deliver groceries, while Tesco has its in-house service Whoosh, Sainsbury’s has Chop Chop and Ocado has Zoom. One of the last remaining quick grocery specialists, Gopuff, launched in the UK in 2021, and operates in London and other big cities including Bristol, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham, Leeds and Cardiff. Zapp continues to operate in London.",

        "title": "Royal Mail pauses fines for ‘fake’ stamps after apparent flaw in fraud scanners",
        "content": "Royal Mail has suspended controversial fines for letters with stamps it deems counterfeit after claims that it was penalising the public for its own inadequate technology. Addressees have been forced to pay a levy of £5 to receive post if Royal Mail suspects that a fake stamp was used by the sender. Hundreds of fines have been issued since barcoded stamps became mandatory last July. Some customers whose letters were surcharged claim that the stamps used were bought from Post Office branches and Royal Mail’s own website and questioned the effectiveness of the scanners used to detect fraud. Others have been warned they risk committing fraud and left out of pocket after sending old-style stamps in to Royal Mail’s stamp swap out scheme. Critics have warned that issue has echoes of the Horizon scandal in which bugs in accounting software led to hundreds of post office operators being accused of fraud. Royal Mail has insisted its technology is “robust” and blamed customers for buying bargain stamps online. However, in a sudden U-turn it today announced that it would suspend issuing surcharges until the end of July while it develops an app to allow customers to authenticate their own stamps. Currently, only designated Royal Mail staff have the ability to scan the barcodes. Earlier this month, it told the Guardian that its security system had to be kept in-house to prevent fraudsters exploiting it. The company is also appointing an independent expert to assess whether a stamp is genuine when a customer appeals and plans to work with retailers and online platforms to prevent stamp fraud. Post bearing suspect stamps will now be returned to sender along with a surcharge where possible. Until now recipients have had to bear the cost if a letter is suspected of having been sent fraudulently. Nick Landon, the chief commercial officer at Royal Mail, said: “The combination of new barcoded stamps with added security features and Royal Mail actively working with retailers, online marketplaces and law enforcement authorities, has led to a 90% reduction in counterfeit stamps. “We want our customers to buy stamps with confidence and always recommend that customers only purchase stamps from Post Offices and other reputable high street retailers, and not to buy stamps online – unless from the official Royal Mail shop.”",

        "title": "Ireland emerges from technical recession; Ocado CEO’s £15m bonus plan approved despite revolt – as it happened",
        "content": "PS: The London stock market has ended the day at a new closing high, just. The FTSE 100 index has closed for the night up 7 points, or 0.1%, at 8147 points. That’s its latest in a series of closing highs. Earlier in the session it nudged a new intraday high of 8189.14 points. Time to wrap up… here’s today’s main stories: Newsflash: Online grocery firm Ocado has been given a bloody nose by shareholders protest over its plan to give its CEO Tim Steiner a potential bonus of almost £15m. But while one in five shareholders opposed the plan, it has been approved. At today’s annual general meeting, 19.4% of shareholders opposed the approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. Another resolution, to approve the Ocado Performance Share Plan 2024, was passed with 80.62% votes in favour, and 19.38% against. As we reported this morning, shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis had urged investors to vote against Ocado’s remuneration policy and performance share plan, citing “egregious remuneration practices”. Campaign group ShareAction planned to ask Ocado’s board why it was comfortable proposing the multimillion-pound pay package for Steiner while “refusing to pay hundreds of its workers a real living wage of £12 an hour”. Under Ocado’s pay plan, Steiner could receive a bonus worth up to 1,800% – or an “enhanced multiplier” – of his £824,570 base salary if its share price hits £29.69 in three years’ time and other performance targets are met. Ocado shares hit £29 during the pandemic when online shopping surged, but have since fallen, trading at 357p today. He would receive an award worth 600% of his base salary, or almost £5m, if targets for total shareholder returns and other performance measures are met but the share price goal is missed. In the mining sector, BHP Group and Vale are proposing a $25.7bn settlement over Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, the Mariana dam failure. The collapse of the Fundão tailings dam in November 2015 killed 19 people, polluted a river and devastated livelihoods downstream of the Samarco Mariana Mining Complex. The dam was co-owned by Vale and BHP, through their Brazilian joint venture Samarco; they have been negotiating with the Brazilian State and Federal Government and other public entities. Today, they say: As part of the settlement negotiations, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale have submitted a non-binding, indicative settlement proposal which is within BHP Brasil’s provision for the Samarco dam failure. The proposal is for a total financial value of approximately R$127 billion (approximately US$25.7 billion) on a 100% basis with Samarco as the primary obligor and a 50% contribution from each of Vale and BHP Brasil as secondary obligors if Samarco cannot fund. The new offer includes around R$37bn (US$7.7bn) already spent on remediation and compensation to date. Shares in Tesla have surged 12% at the start of trading in New York, recovering some of their recent losses. Investors appear to be pleased with Elon Musk’s weekend work in Beijing, where he secured a deal for Tesla to use mapping data provided by web search company Baidu. That deal could be an important step towards Tesla introducing driver assistance technology in the world’s largest car market. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: Baidu, which dominates web search in China, will provide mapping and navigation functions to help Tesla operate its driver assistance technology, which it calls “full self-driving”, or FSD, according to sources cited by Bloomberg News. Mapping services – crucial to driver assistance technologies – are strictly controlled by China’s government. Despite its name, FSD does not provide autonomous driving abilities: it requires a driver who has “hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment”. However, launching it in China could help Tesla in the fierce competition for market share in the country, and provide more income. It costs $8,000, or $99 (£80) a month, although it is not available in many countries. As covered earlier (8.06am), Musk also met with China’s premier, Li Qiang, during an unexpected trip to the Chinese capital. Tesla’s shares are still down 25% so far this year, but have been recovering since mid-April when they sunk to around $140 each, amid concerns over slowing sales. Kristalina Georgieva then warns that Europe is facing two problems – low growth and high debt. She explains: Problem one: growth. Our World Economic Outlook shows the global economy converging back to a rather weak trend rate of growth. Yes, the US economy still looks like it’s firing on all cylinders, but that is unlikely to last. In China, real-estate issues weigh on the outlook. In Europe, productivity growth lags behind, reflecting much less private investment in new technologies than in the United States. This is why we say it is vital to pursue structural reforms and scale-up innovation and investment. Europe needs faster productivity growth, and that means reforms—including transformational ones in the energy and digital arenas, and the completion of the single market. Problem two: debt. After two massive shocks—the pandemic and the energy-supply shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—many countries are shouldering very heavy public debt burdens. This is why we say many countries must now pursue judicious, wellarticulated medium-term fiscal consolidation to rebuild buffers— appropriately tailored to country specifics, of course. This is “not a great place” to start a big push to develop clean energy supply and fight climate change, Georgieva cautions, adding: But let us be clear: if we do not win the fight against climate change, all of humanity together, we will all suffer. Over in Brussels, the head of the International Monetary Fund has welcomed signs that inflation is easing in the eurozone. Kristalina Georgieva, IMF managing director, is addressing the Annual EU Budget Conference, and begins by hailing easing inflation. Georgieva says: The global environment. When we stare out at the horizon, what do we see? I see a hint of sunshine. But I also see a dull grey sky and some dark clouds. Let me start with the sunshine. After a global burst of inflation to levels many people have never seen in their lifetimes, it looks like the ECB’s tight monetary policy is doing its work. This is something I need to say carefully because it’s not over yet. But, yes, it looks promising: inflation down from its disturbingly high peaks and no deep recessions in Europe. Georgieva then warns, though, that the forget though, that “the last mile can be the hardest” in the fight against inflation. No longer will the major central banks be marching in lockstep, as they did during the recent ratehiking cycle. No. From now on, each currency zone will have to chart its own path. An interest rate divergence looms, and maybe some exchange rate movements too. We save the champagne for later. Over at Heathrow Airport, members of Border Force have set up a picket line as a four-day strike in a dispute over working conditions. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union said more than 300 of its members will take part in the industrial action, which started at 5am today and will continue until 7am on Friday. The union said the workers, based at Heathrow’s Terminals 2, 3, 4 and 5, are protesting at plans to introduce new rosters they claim will see around 250 of them forced out of their jobs at passport control. PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote said: “It’s disappointing that, despite talks last week, the Home Office is not prepared to grant any flexibility to their new roster. “None of our dedicated and highly experienced members in the Border Force want to take strike action but the way they’ve been treated by their employer leaves them with no option. “The Home Office still have time to prevent tomorrow’s strike if they agree to abandon this unworkable new system.” Just in: German inflation rise slightly this month. On an EU-harmonised basis, German consumer price inflation rose to 2.4% this month, up from 2.3% in March. On a non-harmonised basis, though, German inflation was flat at 2.2%, with services inflation slowing to 3.4% but goods inflation rising to 1.2%. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, eased to 3% in April from 3.3% in March. Inflation in Spain has risen, as Madrid’s government cut back support for energy bills. Spanish consumer price inflation rose to 3.3% per year in April, up from 3.2% in March. Inflation was pushed up by gas prices – which rose this month but fell in April 2023 – after Spain’s government stopped measures taken to ease rising inflation after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Food prices also rose. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, fell to 2.9% from 3.3% in March. This data, and Germany’s CPI report due in half an hour, will feed into the latest eurozone inflation data due at 10am tomorrow. Ireland’s return to growth is a sign that tomorrow’s eagerly-awaited eurozone GDP report may bring good news. Economists predict the eurozone returned to modest growth in Q1 2024, after shrinking slightly in the second half of last year (GDP fell by 0.1% in both Q3 and Q4 2023). Ireland’s 1.1% growth, and the 0.3% recorded in Belgium this morning, will help that return to growth. Analysts at Investec said last Friday: Recent revisions now mean that the Eurozone was in a technical recession in H2, albeit by the slimmest of margins. Given that economic data at the start of 2024 has been more positive, we expect the Eurozone exited that recession in Q1, with a 0.1% quarterly expansion in output. Newsflash: Ireland has escaped a technical recession, after its economy returned to growth this year driven by its IT sector. Ireland’s GDP is estimated to have risen by 1.1% quarter-on-quarter in January-March, new data from the Central Statistics Office shows. Growth was driven mainly by an increase in the Information &amp; Communication sector. That follows a 3.4% tumble in GDP in the final three months of 2023. Enda Behan, statistician in the National Accounts Data Collection and Quality Division, said: “In today’s release, GDP is estimated to have expanded by 1.1% in Q1 2024 in volume terms when compared with Q4 2023. This was driven by an increase in the multinational dominated sector of Information &amp; Communication in Q1 2024. GDP is estimated to have fallen by 0.8% when compared with the same quarter of 2023. Ireland’s GDP fell in every quarter of last year, shrinking by 3.4% in Q1, 0.1% in Q2 and 2.5% in Q3. But….GDP is not a very precise way of measuring the Irish economy, as it is dominated by multinational companies based in the Republic. Ireland’s government favours another measures, called modified domestic demand, which excludes the large transactions of foreign corporations. Unfortunately we did not have new MDD data today. Just in: economic sentiment has fallen marginally in the EU and the euro area, as Europeans fret about their employment prospects. The Economic Sentiment Indicator declined in the EU (by 0.3 points to 96.2) in April, and by more within the eurozone (where it fell by 0.6 points to 95.6). The employment expectations gauge fell slightly more sharply. Confidence among industrial firms, and among services companies, both fell; consumer confidence inched up, but remained in negative territory. Within individual countries, economic sentiment deteriorated significantly in France (-4.8 points) and more moderately in Italy (-1.3 points), while it improved markedly in Spain (+2.3), Germany (+1.5) and Poland (+1.5). The ESI remained broadly stable in the Netherlands (rising by 0.3). Tomorrow we learn whether the eurozone returned to growth, when GDP data for the first quarter of 2024 is released…. Belgium’s economy has continued to grow at a modest pace, new data from its central bank shows. Belgian GDP rose by 0.3% in January-March, the fourth quarter in a row in which a 0.3% expansion was recorded. Both industry and services grew by 0.3%, while the construction sector shrank by 0.2%. Sweden’s economy has shrunk for the fourth quarter in a row, leaving it in recession. Swedish GDP shrank by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2024, Statistics Sweden reported this morning. Mattias Kain Wyatt, economist at Statistics Sweden, says: “Swedish economic activity continued to weaken in the first quarter of 2024 with contractions in the months of February and March. This is the fourth consecutive quarter with negative growth.” Marc Ostwald, chief economist &amp; global strategist at ADM Investor Service, says the data is much weaker than expected. Sweden’s economy is in a poor run; GDP contracted by 0.8% in April-June 2023, then by 0.3% in July-September 2023, followed by a 0.1% contraction in October-December. New inflation data today has shown that prices rose in four German states this month. In Bavaria, the annual inflation rate rose in April to 2.5% from 2.3% in March, in Brandenburg it rose to 3.0% from 2.8%, in Saxony it rose to 2.7% from 2.5%, and in Hesse it rose to 1.9% from 1.6%. Inflation didn’t rise everwhere, though; it was flat at 2.3% in North Rhine-Westphalia, and fell to 2.1% from 2.3% in Baden-Wuerttemberg. This tees up Germany’s inflation report, due at 1pm today, which is expected to show a rise to 2.3% from 2.2% in March. Shares in Dutch medical device maker Philips have surged by a third this morning, after it settled a legal case in the US over its breathing devices, for less than feared. Philips has agreed to pay $1.1bn to settle all personal injury claims filed in the US over its sleep apnea machines. The devices were recalled in 2021, over concerns that they used foam which could degrade and become toxic, carrying potential cancer risks. Lawsuits (see here) have claimed that people who used these devices had developed cancer, lung problems or other injuries due to degraded foam. Uncertainty over the case had slashed Philips’ market value in the past three years, with forecasts that it could cost around $4bn in a worst-case scenario. CEO Roy Jakobs told reporters today: “$1.1 billion is a significant amount, however you put it. This is important to end uncertainty and to provide clarity on our way forward.” The London stock market has begun the new week on the front foot, jumping to a new alltime high. The FTSE 100 share index jumped by 45 points, or over 0.5%, to a new intraday high of 8185 points. Prudential are among the top riser, up 3%, after fellow Asia-Pacific insurer AIA Group reported strong results. UK retailers Frasers are up 3.1% after announcing a new share buyback programme this morning, while Anglo American are also among the risers on speculation that BHP may make a higher bid. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: ‘’Sentiment is upbeat at the start of the week, fuelled by relief that inflationary pressures in the US aren’t as bad as feared, and hopes return that a ceasefire could be negotiated in the Middle East. The FTSE 100 has scaled fresh heights, with another sprint higher in early trade. April has been a record-breaking month for the blue-chip index, with a glass-half full sentiment dominating. The Footsie has gained more than 11% over the last six months, with super-patient investors finally rewarded by this spurt of growth. The weaker pound against the dollar has been a key player in the power surge, with the greenback gaining ground against a basket of currencies on the latest interest rate expectations. Investor optimism has been buoyed by a rally on US markets on Friday, and developments in the Middle East. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas expected to meet in Egypt, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken ups diplomatic efforts at the World Economic Forum in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia. There’s drama in the foreign exchange market today, with Japan’s yen fluctuating wildly. The yen hit a new 34-year low, trading at 160 yen to the dollar for the first time since 1990. But it then rebounded, back to 155 yen/$, stronger than Friday night’s 157 yen/$. The strength of this recovery has sparked speculation that Toyko may have intervened to support the yen. The yen weakened last Friday after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates on hold, and didn’t provide any sign that it might lift borrowing costs to support the yen. Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, points out that the BoJ is also committed to capping the yield (or interest rate) on government bonds; that makes it harder to take action to support the yen: In the City, shares in miner Anglo American have jumped 2.5% at the start of trading, as traders anticipate further takeover drama. Last Friday, Anglo rejected a £31.1bn approach from larger rival BHP Group, saying it significantly undervalued the miner and its prospects. Since then, a source has told Reuters that BHP is considering making an improved bid, which could be made in the coming weeks. Anglo’s shares have risen to £27 this morning, for the first time in just over a year, further above BHP’s initial offer of £25.08 per share. Elon Musk appears to be flying back from China after a busy, if unexpected, trip to Beijing on Sunday. A plane linked to Musk has taken off from Beijing, Reuters reported at 6.22am UK time today. During his trip, Musk held talks with the country’s premier, Li Qiang, and posted: Honored to meet with Premier Li Qiang. “We have known each other now for many years, since early Shanghai days. Over the weekend, Tesla reached a deal with Chinese search giant Baidu for its mapping and navigation functions, which could help the electric car company gain approval for its driver-assistance technology in China. In another breakthrough, local Chinese authorities removed restrictions on Tesla cars after the company’s China-made vehicles passed the country’s data security requirements. Previously, Teslas had been banned from some government-related properties due to concerns about what data was being collected. Tesla’s vehicles were not the only ones that passed the data security rules, CNBC points out, adding: In addition to Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y, several new energy vehicles from BYD, Lotus, Nezha, Li Auto and Nio passed China’s data security requirements, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers and the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China said Sunday. Prices for smaller homes such as flats have been increasing at a faster rate than bigger properties amid affordability constraints, according to lender Halifax this morning. Halifax reports that the “race for space” that was seen during the coronavirus pandemic has now gone into reverse, with buyers targeting smaller, cheaper homes. In the year to February, the average price of a flat increased by 2.7%, while the average terraced property value rose by 2.6%, Halifax said. Prices for semi-detached and detached homes increased at lower rates, rising by 1.7% and 2.0% respectively. Amanda Bryden, head of Halifax Mortgages, said: “As interest rates have stabilised and buyers adjust to the new economic reality of owning a home, one way to compensate for higher borrowing costs is to target smaller properties. “This is especially true among first-time buyers, who have proven to be resilient over recent years, and now account for the largest proportion of homes purchased with a mortgage in almost 30 years. “We see this reflected in property prices for the first few months of this year, with the value of flats rising most sharply, closing the ‘growth gap’ on bigger properties that’s existed for most of the last four years.” Zoopla’s calculations showing a rise in mortgage costs come at a time when several mortgage lenders are increasing rates, blaming “market uncertainty”. The City currently expect just two interest rate cuts this year, less than they expected at the start of 2024, with the first cut fully priced in for September. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agents Knight Frank, says “Housing market activity has rebounded over the last year but the shock of the mini-Budget was still reverberating during the early months of 2023. The pipeline of sales has grown since Christmas, largely as positivity from January translates into spring listings. Since then, the prospect of the first rate cut since March 2020 has become more remote with each release of economic data, which means mortgage rates have edged back up and house prices are once again under downwards pressure.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. A year and a half on from the mini-budget turmoil, UK households are still paying sharply more when they take out a mortgage. New research from property website Zoopla this morning shows that higher mortgage rates are adding to the affordability pressures on buyers, and dragging on house price inflation. Zoopla has calculated that the average home buyer taking out a 70% loan to value mortgage now face annual mortgage repayments that are 61% higher today than three years ago (in March 2021) before mortgage rates started to rise. That’s because mortgage rates are around 4.5% today compared to below 2% in March 2021, meaning average annual mortgage repayments have risen from £7,100 to £11,400. However, only two-thirds of this increase is driven by higher mortgage rates, with a third down to the fact that house prices are 13% higher than 3 years ago, Zoopla adds. Londoners (where property prices are highest), face the largest increase, of £7,500 per year. Buyers in the South West, South East and East of England face paying at least £5,000 per year more. Across other regions and countries of the UK, the increase is lower, at between £2,350 and £3,900 a year. Mortgage rates had been rising in 2022 as the Bank of England lifted interest rates, and the City anticipated further tightening. But costs then jumped after the unfunded tax cuts in the mini-budget of September 2022 alarmed investors, prompting a selloff in government bonds used to price fixed mortgages. Liz Truss, though, last week declined to apologise for the sharp rise in interest rates during her time in office, pointing out that mortgage rates have gone up across the world. But, UK government bond yields (which rise when prices fall) certainly did spike through September 2022: Zoopla’s data also shows that house sales volumes are up 12% year on year, in the four weeks to 21 April, putting the market on track for 1.1m sales in 2024, up 10% on last year But prices dipped by 0.2% month-on-month, while almost two thirds (64%) of all homes are in local markets where prices are lower than a year ago. Factors including higher mortgage rates and stamp duty are behind ongoing price falls across the south of England, Zoopla reckons. Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, says the market is adjusting to higher borrowing costs; he doesn’t believe prices will start to rise as buyers face much higher mortgage repayments than in the recent past, so sellers should remain realistic. “The rebound in sales being agreed continues for a fourth month as mortgage rates have fallen, consumer confidence improves and home buyers have much greater choice of homes for sale. The pipeline of sales is growing and we expect 100,000 more people to move home in 2024 than last year. Also coming up today Ocado faces a showdown with shareholders at its annual meeting today, over a new pay scheme that could hand boss Tim Steiner a bonus share award of up to £15m. While in Whitehall, senior officials are worried that Thames Water’s financial collapse could trigger a rise in government borrowing costs not seen since the chaos of the mini-budget. Officials in the Treasury and the UK’s Debt Management Office fear that, unless the UK’s biggest water company is renationalised as soon as possible, “prolonged uncertainty” about its fate could “damage confidence in UK plc at a sensitive time”….

        "title": "Secondhand fashion seller Vinted moves into profit after 61% sales rise",
        "content": "The online secondhand fashion seller Vinted has reported a 61% rise in sales to almost €600m (£513m), taking the company out of the red for the first time amid a boom in demand for “pre-loved” clothing. The Lithuania-based group said growth had been spurred by entering new markets including Denmark and Finland; an expansion into luxury fashion through its acquisition of secondhand high-end fashion site Rebelle in 2022; and the launch of a verification service. Vinted said sales rose to €596m last year – making it about a third of the size of Asos – while profit after tax was €17.8m compared with a loss of about €20m a year before. The group employs more than 2,000 people, most of whom are based in Lithuania. Vinted’s growth comes as concerns about sustainability, tight budgets and boredom with copycat fashion across the high street have driven a sharp increase in sales of secondhand clothing, particularly among young people. Late last year the company secured a €50m credit facility to help it expand, including potentially acquiring other businesses and expanding its delivery service Vinted Go. Thomas Plantenga, the chief executive of Vinted Group, said it was looking at a variety of different options for growth including moving into new countries and product categories. “We see many opportunities ahead, so we’ll continue to balance profitability against investment opportunities to accelerate towards our mission,” he added. “Secondhand fashion is still a relatively immature market and only a tiny proportion of fashion overall. Our performance in 2023 was not only proof that we can deliver strong growth but that we are at the forefront of a market with huge potential.” The “pre-loved” category has gained mainstream popularity. The reality TV show Love Island was sponsored by eBay and featured some contestants acting as influencers to promote secondhand style. Mainstream retail chains including Primark are also hosting secondhand sections in their stores. Despite the shift, online secondhand specialists have struggled to make money, and Vinted’s rivals Depop and RealReal reported losses last year. Against the backdrop of heavy competition among sellers, the eBay marketplace recently removed all seller fees for pre-owned fashion. Sales of “pre-loved” clothing and footwear are on track to make up a tenth of the global fashion market next year. Global sales of pre-owned clothes surged by 18% last year to $197bn (£156bn) and are forecast to reach $350bn in 2028, according to a report by GlobalData for the resale specialist ThredUp. The landmark is expected to be reached a year later than predicted, as global growth remains slightly behind previous estimates.",

        "title": "‘Watershed moment’ for Tesla as Elon Musk’s visit to China reaps quick reward",
        "content": "Elon Musk’s visit to China has reportedly reaped immediate rewards with a deal for Tesla to use mapping data provided by web search company Baidu, a big step in introducing driver assistance technology in the world’s largest car market. Musk made an unannounced visit to China over the weekend. The billionaire posted a picture of his meeting with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, on X, the social network he took over in 2022. Baidu, which dominates web search in China, will provide mapping and navigation functions to help Tesla operate its driver assistance technology, which it calls “full self-driving”, or FSD, according to sources cited by Bloomberg News. Mapping services – crucial to driver assistance technologies – are strictly controlled by China’s government. Despite its name, FSD does not provide autonomous driving abilities: it requires a driver who has “hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment”. However, launching it in China could help Tesla in the fierce competition for market share in the country, and provide more income. It costs $8,000, or $99 (£80) a month, although it is not available in many countries. Musk is often combative in his dealings with politicians, such as strident criticism of the US president, Joe Biden, or a standoff in Brazil against a government he claims is censoring X, formerly known as Twitter. However, he adopted a more emollient tone towards China’s second most powerful politician, saying he was “honoured” to meet Li. Musk has a tangled relationship with China because of his various business interests. X is blocked by China’s government – which has rigid censorship. China’s government has also complained to the UN about close encounters between its space station and satellites launched by SpaceX, Musk’s rocket company. However, Tesla runs a factory in Shanghai, and its Model Y was the third bestselling electric or plug-in hybrid car in China in March 2024, according to Clean Technica. BYD, a Chinese manufacturer that vies with Tesla to be the world’s biggest seller of electric cars, boasts the two top-selling models. The visit and report of the Baidu deal was greeted with excitement by Tesla investors, many of whom are counting on potential autonomous driving abilities to justify Tesla’s position as the world’s most valuable carmaker. Tesla’s share price rose by 6% in trading before the New York markets opened. Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush, an investment bank, wrote in a note to clients: “This is a watershed moment for Musk as well as Beijing at a time that Tesla has faced massive domestic EV competition in China along with softer demand. While the long-term valuation story at Tesla hinges on FSD and autonomous, a key missing piece in that puzzle is Tesla making FSD available in China which now appears on the doorstep.”",

        "content": "The struggling owner of music back catalogues ranging from Shakira to the Red Hot Chili Peppers has agreed a $1.6bn (£1.3bn) improved takeover offer from the US private equity investor Blackstone. Hipgnosis Songs Fund said it was recommending the offer, which trumped a $1.4bn bid by the US-based royalties fund Concord Music. The takeover would mark the end of a turbulent six years for Hipgnosis as a listed company in London. The company was founded in 2018 by Merck Mercuriadis, the former manager of acts including Elton John, Iron Maiden, Guns N’ Roses and Beyoncé. Mercuriadis used his music industry connections to spend millions on the rights to 138 catalogues with more than 40,000 songs, in the hope that they would provide a steady stream of income that would be attractive to investors. However, the company ran into trouble because of rising interest rates and changes to the valuation of its songs. Investors voted in October against continuing the struggling fund in its then form, forcing it to review its options. Other artist back catalogues owned by Hipgnosis include works by Barry Manilow, Blondie, Enrique Iglesias, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, the Kaiser Chiefs, Neil Young and Nile Rodgers. Blackstone had last week indicated it was considering a firm offer for Hipgnosis. The confirmed offer is equivalent to 104p a share, higher than Hipgnosis’s 100p float price, after its price fell as low as 56p in March. Shares were up by 2.3% at 106p on Monday morning, after the agreed takeover by Blackstone was announced. The bid is 4% higher than Concord’s, and Blackstone said it was a 48% premium to the closing price before the first talks began. Blackstone has extra leverage in the bid battle because of its previous relationship with Hipgnosis Songs Management (HSM), the company set up by Mercuriadis to act as investment adviser to the main fund but then removed amid the turmoil. While the bid is separate to that investment, Blackstone has threatened legal action to exercise an option to buy the Hipgnosis assets for six months after the end of the investment adviser agreement. Robert Naylor, the chair of Hipgnosis, said: “Since we started our strategic review, we have been clearly focused on looking at all the options to deliver shareholder value. We are delighted that, following competitive interests in acquiring Hipgnosis, our investors now have a chance to immediately realise their holding at an increased premium.” Qasim Abbas, the senior managing director of Blackstone, said: “Our offer price, which has been unanimously recommended by the board, represents a significant premium to the unaffected share price and allows shareholders to realise immediate and attractive value for their shareholding.”",

        "title": "Optus announces $1.6bn network sharing deal with rival TPG",
        "content": "Optus has announced a $1.6bn network sharing agreement with its rival TPG after lobbying against a similar deal between TPG and Telstra, which was kiboshed by the competition tribunal last year. The Singtel-owned company and Vodafone’s parent company said on Monday the agreement will see TPG more than double its 4G coverage to 1,000,000 sq km and reach 98.4% of the population. The multi-operator core network agreement, which will need the approval of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, will also give Optus access to some of TPG’s spectrum. Over the course of the 11-year agreement, TPG is expected to pay Optus close to $1.6bn, with Optus paying TPG $420m for the spectrum access. The two companies will continue to operate their own core networks for security and resiliency independence, and maintain their own networks in metro areas. Optus said it will fast-track the number of 5G-enabled sites to reach 1,500 by 2028 and 2,444 by the end of 2030. Optus had opposed Telstra and TPG teaming up two years ago on a network sharing agreement, which was ultimately struck down by the competition tribunal almost a year ago. In that ruling, the tribunal left the door open for alternative network sharing agreements. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Optus’s interim CEO, Michael Venter, told Guardian Australia that Optus and TPG had designed an agreement that was different to that of the TPG and Telstra deal. “There are some similarities between the transaction but there are some differences as well. And we believe that these differences are significant enough that the ACCC will not have a problem with this,” he said. He said the biggest difference is that under the previous agreement Telstra, as the dominant player, would have gained access to even more spectrum than it already held. “We are confident that although we get access to the same level of spectrum, the starting position is very different in that Optus is not the dominant player in that region yet.” He said Optus expects regulatory approvals to be finalised by the beginning of 2025, and for the agreement to commence then. It is a non-exclusive deal meaning both companies could make further network sharing deals. TPG Telecom’s CEO, Iñaki Berroeta, said in a statement the network sharing agreement would improve competition in regional areas while also reducing the cost of duplicating infrastructure between the two companies. “This will allow us to reduce rollout and operating costs, make better use of network assets and deliver huge customer benefits,” Berroeta said. “In a country as large as Australia, this is the sustainable approach we need to maximise established infrastructure, and expand the reach of telecommunications services, competition and choice for consumers.” The agreement comes as Optus prepares to shut down its 3G network in September after Telstra in June and following TPG in December last year. Optus’s vice-president of regulator and government affairs, Andrew Sheridan, said Optus’s 4G network footprint is already 20% larger than its 3G footprint, and did not expect the shutdown to reduce coverage in regional and remote parts of Australia. “4G has been a long rollout, to every single town we test coverage. We’re pretty confident our coverage will be as good or better.” The main task facing the company as well as its rivals is shifting hundreds of thousands of customers on older mobile devices to 4G- and 5G-compatible devices.",

        "title": "Binance founder faces possible three-year jail term over ‘wild west’ business model ",
        "content": "Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, will be sentenced on Tuesday after pleading guilty to money laundering charges, with US prosecutors seeking three years in prison for the tech tycoon. Zhao, 47, stepped down as chief executive of Binance in November after admitting to breaking US anti-money laundering laws. Last month, another fallen cryptocurrency mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried, whose FTX exchange collapsed in 2022, received a 25-year sentence for committing fraud and conspiracy to launder money. Prosecutors made the request for a 36-month sentence in a filing in Seattle federal court last week, arguing that sentencing Zhao to twice the maximum 18 months recommended under federal guidelines would reflect the gravity of his offences, and send a message that “the right choice, every time, is to comply with the law.” The memorandum said Binance operated on a “wild west” model under Zhao’s leadership, failing to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions due to poor internal controls. The suspect trades included transactions with designated terrorist groups Hamas, al-Qaida and Isis. “Zhao’s willful violation of US law was no accident or oversight,” said the prosecutors. “He made a business decision that violating US law was the best way to attract users, build his company, and line his pockets.” Zhao agreed to step down as Binance CEO after he and the company admitted breaching the Bank Secrecy Act. Binance agreed to pay a financial penalty of $4.3bn (£3.4bn) while Zhao was fined $50m. Zhao’s fortune as the owner of a cornerstone of the $2.5tn cryptocurrency market remains intact despite the fine. According to the Bloomberg billionaires index, Zhao is worth $41.6bn and is the 29th richest person in the world. Last week, Zhao, who since entering his guilty plea has been free in the US on a $175m bond, apologised for his actions in a letter to the judge overseeing the case. Zhao said there was “no excuse” for his failure to implement effective compliance controls at Binance. “I apologise for my poor decisions and accept full responsibility for my actions. In hindsight, I should have focused on implementing compliance changes at Binance from the get-go, and I did not,” he wrote. Zhao added that he intended to spend a “significant portion” of his time in the future helping young people in “as many places as possible”. Zhao, a Canadian citizen, was born in the Chinese coastal province of Jiangsu, north of Shanghai, and followed his academic father to Canada in his early teens. A graduate in computer science from Montreal’s McGill University, he worked in programming systems for the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Bloomberg before establishing a high-frequency trading platform in Shanghai, where a discussion about bitcoin at a poker game ultimately led to the creation of Binance in 2017. Seeking a lenient sentence, Zhao‘s lawyers have referenced the first-time offender’s “unflinching” acceptance of responsibility, his multimillion-dollar fine, and the lack of imprisonment as punishment in similar cases. The new chief executive of Binance is Richard Teng, who has a regulatory background and was promoted from head of regional markets at the exchange. Teng has shed some light on Binance’s opaque structure by telling a conference this month that “a few jurisdictions” are under consideration as its global headquarters. Binance says it has regional headquarters in France and Dubai but its complex structure has been highlighted by regulators, with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) describing the business as an “opaque web of corporate entities”. A filing by the CFTC last year quoted Zhao explaining that Binance operates via entities in numerous jurisdictions in order to “keep countries clean [of violations of law] … This is the main reason .com does not land anywhere.” Figures from The Block, a crypto news and data firm, show that while Binance remains the global market leader its market share has dropped. Its share of the spot trading market, where cryptocurrencies are bought and sold, has fallen from 56.5% in March 2023 to 45.4% last month. Its share of the futures market for bitcoin, where bets are placed on price movements in the cornerstone cryptocurrency, has declined to 40% from more than 50% a year ago. Carol Alexander, a professor of finance at the University of Sussex business school, said lawsuits against Binance, including one still pending from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has affected some investors who have “lost trust in Binance as a safe place for their assets”. Binance, however, points to strong inflows into the exchange of more than $11bn so far this year, amid a resurgence in the bitcoin price, which has climbed more than 40% since January. A spokesperson added that the company is “proud of the continued evolution of our business as we move past historical compliance issues and continue to deliver for our users worldwide”. The SEC case, however, still hangs over the company. In June last year, the regulator filed 13 charges against Binance entities and Zhao, accusing them of making billions of dollars while “placing investors’ assets at significant risk”. At the time, Binance said it was “disappointed” by the charges but it means the company still faces legal issues. “Binance’s problems are far from over,” says Howard Fischer, a partner at New York law firm Moses &amp; Singer",

        "title": "Ireland reaps €700m Brexit bonanza from customs duties",
        "content": "Ireland has landed a €700m (£600m) Brexit bonanza with a steep increase in tax revenues flowing from customs duties now applicable to imports of clothing, food and other goods from Great Britain. Before Brexit, Britain enjoyed customs-free exports to Ireland and the rest of the EU because it was part of the single market and customs union. But when Boris Johnson sealed a hard Brexit and quit the single market, it meant fresh controls, checks and duties would be payable on exports to the EU. New data in Ireland shows a 90% jump in customs duty receipts in Ireland between 2020 and 2021 when Brexit came into force. Taking the pandemic into account and comparing 2019 with the three post-Brexit years, a significant jump in revenues can be seen. In 2021, there was a €178m increase or 52% rise in customs revenues compared with 2019. In the following year, receipts were 80% higher by the same comparison, amounting to an extra €617m, and in 2023 the Irish exchequer scooped a 72% increase. The report released by the Irish Revenue Commissioners on Friday noted that a significant amount of customs duty came from imports from China, but it attributed the scale of change to Brexit. “The level of customs duties has effectively doubled in recent years compared to the previous decade, reflecting the transformation of Great Britain into a third country in 2021,” it said. The report added that Great Britain was “the top country of dispatch for both customs duties and the value of imported goods”. Customs duties collected on imports from Great Britain made up almost half (45%) of Ireland’s total last year – equivalent to about €264m. Figures compiled from preliminary revenue reports suggest that almost all of the increase in custom revenues over the past three years has been due to Brexit. David Henig, the director of the UK Trade Policy Project at the European Centre for International Political Economy, said: “It could be seen as good news for Ireland. But there is a bit of bad news there which points to the costs of Brexit, and the question of who is paying for the customs duties – is it coming off profits of exporters or is it being passed on to the consumer in the price of clothing and food?” Not all goods attract tariffs: those that comply with rules of origin and are mostly made in the EU or the UK have a zero tariff under the Brexit trade deal. Henig said he thought some of the tariff revenues enjoyed by Ireland came from non-EU goods being held in Great Britain for distribution in the UK and Ireland, such as clothes made in India, Bangladesh or Morocco and sold in high street stores such as Penneys in Ireland, owned by Primark. This seems to be confirmed by the data. The Revenue Commissioners report said: “Prior to the UK’s departure from the EU, a significant proportion of goods destined for Ireland came via distribution centres in the UK … and the UK would have collected the customs duties on behalf of the EU.” Since Brexit, “Ireland is now required to collect those customs duties”, it said. Not all revenues remain in Ireland. Under EU arrangements, a member state can retain 25% of duties elected, with the remainder going into the bloc’s overall central budget. According to the data, the largest customs income in 2023 was from articles of apparel and clothing accessories at about €146m, followed by plastics, vehicles, and “footwear, gaiters and the like”. Electrical machinery came next, followed by preparations of meat, fish, crustaceans, molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates. The Brexit bonanza is likely to be reflected across the EU but is particularly felt in Ireland because Great Britain is one of its biggest trading partners, with exports worth £57.6bn to the country in 2023, according to data released by HMRC on 19 April, making Ireland the UK’s sixth-largest trading partner.",

        "title": "Ocado pay backlash looms as firm moves to offer boss £14.8m package",
        "content": "Ocado is facing criticism as it seeks shareholder approval on Monday for a potential bonus worth up to £14.8m for its chief executive, Tim Steiner. Glass Lewis, an influential shareholder advisory group, has urged investors to vote against the online grocery group’s remuneration policy and performance share plan at its annual shareholder meeting, flagging “egregious remuneration practices”. Glass Lewis said “we remain concerned about the potential for excessive remuneration” and “question the need for this enhanced incentivisation tool”. Dan Howard from the campaign group ShareAction, which heads up the Good Work coalition representing $6.6tn in assets under management, said he planned to ask Ocado’s board why it was comfortable proposing the multimillion-pound pay package for Steiner while “refusing to pay hundreds of its workers a real living wage of £12 an hour”. He urged the company to become accredited to the independently verified Living Wage Foundation scheme which each year calculates the minimum hourly earnings required to cover the cost of living. Those who sign up must pay all employees and third-party contractors at least the minimum rate. “Ocado has been talking about addressing low pay for five years but has yet to make a long-term commitment. Today we’re calling on the board to pay the real Living Wage – this would make a significant difference to the lives of hundreds of its lowest-paid workers,” Howard said. He said Ocado’s pay policy meant it was lagging behind industry peers such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Marks &amp; Spencer, all of which have committed to pay their staff at least the real living wage. The online grocery tech group wants to launch a scheme under which Steiner could receive a bonus worth up to 1,800% – or an “enhanced multiplier” – of his £824,570 base salary if its share price hits £29.69 in three years’ time and other performance targets are met. Ocado shares hit £29 during the pandemic when online shopping surged, but have since fallen, closing at 353p on Friday. He would receive an award worth 600% of his base salary, or almost £5m, if targets for total shareholder returns and other performance measures are met but the share price goal is missed. Ocado is no stranger to battles with shareholders over high pay. The latest scheme is intended to replace an earlier long-term bonus plan known as the “value creation plan” (VCP) which is expiring in 2027. Ocado said it wanted to replace that scheme because “unprecedented volatility” in its share price had “served to undermine the impact of the VCP scheme to the extent that it is no longer motivating or retentive to many of its participants.” In 2022, Ocado shareholders rebelled against high pay for directors at the online grocery specialist, with almost 30% voting against a plan to pay Steiner up to £100m over the following five years. Despite the protest vote, Ocado went ahead with a three-year extension to the VCP, under which Steiner could earn up to £20m a year and other executives up to £5m each. Ocado declined to comment but in its annual report, the chair of the remuneration committee, Julie Southern, said: “My belief, and that of the committee, is that these new proposals preserve a focus on the level of ambition which is so important to Ocado, while continuing to ensure our remuneration structures align the interests of our senior management team directly with those of our shareholders. “They offer substantial comparative reward for transformational performance while migrating to a structure that will be more motivating and retentive for executives, better suited to attracting senior new hires, and acceptable to a wider group of our shareholders.”",

        "title": "Real terms average pay lower in most UK local authorities than in 2008, TUC finds",
        "content": "Pay packets are smaller than they were in 2008 in most local authority areas in the UK, according to analysis by the Trades Union Congress, which described the findings as a “damning indictment” of the Conservatives’ economic record. The TUC, which includes 48 unions with more than five million members, said stagnating wages meant British workers were in the midst of the longest squeeze on wages since the Napoleonic era. Real terms average pay, which factors in inflation, is less than it was in 2008, the year the global financial crisis struck, in nearly two-thirds (63%) of UK local authorities, the TUC said. The union body estimates that the average UK worker would be £10,400 a year better off if real wages had grown at their pre-crisis trend – the equivalent of £200 a week. London has the highest share of what it called “wage black spots”, with real pay below 2008 levels in nearly all of the capital’s local authorities. The TUC blamed austerity imposed by the Conservatives, saying that wages had begun to grow after the 2008 global financial crash when David Cameron’s government took office in 2010. It said the nascent recovery slammed into reverse as the government reined in public spending, including real terms wage cuts in the public sector. In the decade before the crash, between 1997 and 2008, real weekly wages in the UK grew on average by 1.7% each year, the TUC said. Since the banking crisis that engulfed the world in 2008, average annual growth has been –0.2%. While the crisis affected the global economy, the TUC said that UK wages had recovered particularly slowly. It blamed successive Tory governments for “one of the worst records” for pay growth among nations in the OECD group of developed economies. “This is a damning indictment of the Conservatives’ economic record,” said the TUC’s general secretary, Paul Nowak. “This is the same government that’s given us the most dramatic fall in living standards on record. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We can create a new era of decent pay growth again where families’ living standards rise rather than falling backwards,” he added. The TUC analysed data from 340 local authorities for which it was available, finding that wages in nearly two-thirds (212) were below 2008 levels. Even in the north-east, the region of England least affected, pay undershot 2008 in half of local authorities. “The Tories’ failure to grow the economy – and their scorched-earth austerity policies – has decimated family budgets,” said Nowak. “Just imagine how much better off people would be if they had an extra £10,400 in their pay packets each year – and how much more prosperous the country would be.” A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “A global surge in inflation caused by Putin’s war in Ukraine has hit the value of wages right across the world. “Despite these challenging international factors, since 2010, this government has made huge strides in ending low pay, with jumps in the value of the National Living Wage meaning the number of people in jobs classified as ‘low paid’ has halved. Additionally as part of our determination to end low pay, this month we increased the National Living Wage for workers aged 21 and over, putting more money in the pockets of almost 3 million workers. “Through supporting the Bank of England and sticking to our plan, inflation is now down to 3.2% and real wages are growing. Additionally we’ve been able to cut National Insurance by a third – worth £900 a year to the average worker.”",

        "title": "Thames Water collapse could trigger Truss-style borrowing crisis, Whitehall officials fear",
        "content": "Senior Whitehall officials fear Thames Water’s financial collapse could trigger a rise in government borrowing costs not seen since the chaos of the Liz Truss mini-budget, the Guardian can reveal. Such is their concern about the impact on wider borrowing costs for the UK, even beyond utilities and infrastructure, that they believe Thames should be renationalised before the general election. Officials in the Treasury and the UK’s Debt Management Office fear that, unless the UK’s biggest water company is renationalised as soon as possible, “prolonged uncertainty” about its fate could “damage confidence in UK plc at a sensitive time”, with elections in the UK and the US later this year. Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed details of government contingency plans, known as Project Timber, to renationalise Thames via a special administration. This could lead to the bulk of its £15bn of debt being moved on to the government’s balance sheet. Thames’ investors have refused to pump more money into the struggling company amid a standoff with the water regulator Ofwat. Some lenders to its core operating company could lose up to 40% of their money under the plans, a move that officials believe marks a careful balance between managing public outrage at the water company’s many failures and the need to sustain investor confidence in the UK. Those contingency plans also describe a risk of “contagion” from Thames’s plight that could trigger a loss of confidence that feeds through to wider state borrowing costs. In the aftermath of the Truss mini-budget in September 2022, UK borrowing costs shot up as government debt markets went into freefall. Her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s promise of £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, the sacking of the most senior civil servant at the Treasury and Truss’s refusal to have her sums checked by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility spooked investors and sent the value of UK debt instruments, known as gilts, plummeting. The pound hit a low against the dollar not seen since 1985, and the whiplash effect on the bond market damaged some pension funds’ investment strategies so severely that the Bank of England had to stage an emergency market intervention to maintain market stability. That crisis added billions of pounds to the UK’s cost of borrowing, as investors demanded a higher price to lend to it. British households experienced big spikes in mortgage costs, as banks and building societies passed on higher borrowing costs. Many mortgage offers were pulled overnight. While Kwarteng’s successor, Jeremy Hunt, reversed the tax plans and stabilised debt markets, the UK’s cost of borrowing has crept up again in recent months amid geopolitical shocks, including the Middle East conflict. The UK’s growing debt pile and sluggish economic growth have added to investors’ wariness to lend to it. The UK’s £2.7tn of debt stands at about 98% of GDP, and will continue to swell as the government needs to borrow heavily to overhaul its ageing network of pipes, cables, water and power infrastructure. The global lender of last resort, the International Monetary Fund, has warned that the UK is among economies where “debt vulnerabilities continue to grow” as inflation remains elevated. “Globally, borrowers would find it harder to service debt, given higher bond yields,” it said this month. The British state relies on being lent money by investors, often foreign, to fund its spending. These loans take the form of gilts. Prices for these IOUs fall as yields rise. A higher yield is generally an indication of the risk associated with the loan. Debt issued by regulated utilities such as water companies has traditionally been seen as a safe haven for investors, with a gold-plated risk profile similar to gilts. There is increasing concern in Whitehall that the longer it takes to resolve the crisis at Thames, which has 16 million consumers, the greater the spillover effects will be. Thames has said it has enough money in its operating company to last for more than a year. “It’s coming at a time of significant domestic and global political uncertainty,” said one official. “This is not something that benefits from being left unresolved. Investors want clarity and certainty even if there is a short-term pain.” “There is a real risk of contagion from Thames,” said a second official. Whitehall officials expect any restructuring that involves investors losing money in Thames’ water operating company to trigger legal action against the government and Ofwat. Still, officials view a swift renationalisation that forces lenders to bear losses as preferable to a long, drawn out debate over the fate of Thames that weighs on the UK’s needs to raise capital for infrastructure projects and for its general debt issuance. The Debt Management Office (DMO), an arm of the Treasury, is responsible for issuing new UK debt. In response to figures last week showing that Hunt will probably need to borrow more than originally hoped, the body announced it would increase sales of UK gilts this year by an extra £12.4bn. This takes the total expected sale of UK government debt this year to £277.7bn. The government declined to comment on questions about the Treasury and DMO’s concerns. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Given water companies are commercial entities, it would be inappropriate for government to comment specifically on Thames Water.” In a potential signal of the debt challenges the UK faces, a recent sale of new debt recorded the highest borrowing costs for a 30-year term bond sold via a syndication – a group of lenders – since 2005, when records began.",

        "title": "Union appears to accept Royal Mail proposal to cut most Saturday deliveries",
        "content": "Letterboxes could fall silent on Saturday mornings, after the postal workers’ union appeared to accept a proposal from Royal Mail that would abandon its duty to deliver all letters six days a week. Royal Mail is required to deliver post from Monday to Saturday under the terms of the universal service obligation (USO) set down by an act of parliament in 2011. Amid a long-running industrial dispute with the financially struggling company, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) has so far opposed a £300m cost-cutting blueprint that would include scrapping most Saturday services. But the union appeared to concede last week that a complete six-day service is unaffordable. The change of heart comes as the 500-year-old company battles a £3.1bn takeover bid from its largest shareholder, the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský. Speaking at the CWU’s annual conference in Bournemouth last week, the union’s deputy general secretary, Martin Walsh, said: “The reality is, the USO as a six-day option is no longer financially viable. The challenges we face are so significant – probably the most challenging time in this union’s history, whether it’s the USO change, sale or possible takeover.” Royal Mail reported a £1bn loss last year, with bosses blaming strike action by CWU members and a failure to increase productivity for its poor performance during a year in which it cut 10,000 jobs. It also said that fewer deliveries were required because the volume of letters sent has fallen from 20bn in 2004-05 to 7bn last year. Union sources told the Times that accepting changes to the six-day service did not mean a complete end to Saturday post because first-class mail would still be delivered. However, first-class stamp prices are not capped, meaning the company could increase prices steeply to reduce the number of Saturday deliveries it is required to make. Royal Mail’s plans could see second-class deliveries reduced to every other day, with reductions achieved partly by slowing down bulk deliveries for government departments and businesses from two days to three days. Such a change would reduce the number of postal rounds by 9,000 a day. But it must first persuade ministers and the media regulator, Ofcom, to accept its proposals. Ofcom has yet to respond, while Kevin Hollinrake, the government minister for postal affairs, has not given his blessing. “There is no done deal here and, as far as we are concerned, the USO remains and we are not aware of any recommendations [by Ofcom] to change it,” he told the Times. But any accord between Royal Mail and its union – which represents 110,000 postal workers – could smooth the way for government approval, especially after a prolonged period of bitter industrial action, including several strikes. Křetínský, who is estimated to be worth £7.3bn, launched a £3.1bn takeover bid for Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), earlier this month. The 320p a share offer is far below the peak of nearly 580p that the company reached in summer 2021, and has been rejected by IDS. Success would see Křetínský add Royal Mail to a business empire that was built on energy assets but also includes stakes in Sainsbury’s and West Ham United FC. The investor, known as the “Czech Sphinx” due to his inscrutable demeanour, has until 15 May to improve his offer. Křetínský is being advised on his attempt to take over Royal Mail by JP Morgan’s Chuka Umunna, the former shadow business secretary – who became a rising star during his time on the Treasury select committee, when he criticised highly paid bankers.",

        "title": "BHP’s pursuit of Anglo American has a major obstacle: South Africa",
        "content": "The world’s largest mining company has a problem. Australia’s BHP has set out its intention to snap up the rival miner Anglo American in a multibillion-pound deal that would reshape the global industry. Its proposed £31bn takeover plan has already been rebuffed as a lowball offer that undervalues the company. But Anglo’s deep roots in South Africa could be a far more sensitive issue to address. Africa’s most advanced economy was built on mining. For more than 150 years since the first discovery of diamonds, gold and coal, the industry has remained South Africa’s economic lifeblood. Today it is the world’s fifth largest producer of coal and diamonds and the 10th largest producer of gold. As a result, Anglo American has held a role at the centre of South Africa’s fortunes, affording the company enormous soft power in the country’s economic and political development. In return, South Africa’s government is Anglo’s largest shareholder, with a 7% stake held via its Public Investment Corporation. A takeover would in effect strip South Africa of a 100-year bond with one of the world’s biggest companies. “Nobody here views this deal favourably,” said James Lorimer, the shadow minister for mining and natural resources. “Anglo American’s business here was once the jewel in the crown of South Africa’s economy. Under this deal it could be sold off for parts from someone else’s company.” BHP has made clear that its interest lies in copper. Anglo American’s vast copper reserves in Chile and Peru would make BHP the world’s largest producer of copper at a time when it has never been more profitable. It is in the extraction of copper – a vital building block in the development of renewable energy projects and electric vehicles – that the mining industry can see a clear path ahead into a low-carbon future. By contrast, South Africa’s assets are considered a risk rather than a reward. BHP plans to exclude shares in Anglo’s Kumba Iron Ore and its Amplats platinum businesses to reduce its exposure to the South African market, which it exited in 2015 by spinning out the mining company South32. Its subsidiary De Beers, the world’s largest diamond miner, has revealed a slump in production as luxury spending slips and lab-grown diamond alternatives begin to erode its market share. BHP’s reluctance to forge fresh ties with South Africa appears mutual, if comments made by Gwede Mantashe, the country’s mining minister, are anything to go by. Mantashe, an ANC veteran and former trade union leader, told the Financial Times that he was opposed to the deal because South Africa’s previous experience with BHP was “not positive”. The company “never did much for South Africa”, he said. Anglo occupies a unique position within the country: it was built on the backs of cheap black labour during decades of institutionalised racial oppression, but its founders also acted as a driving force behind the dismantling of the apartheid state. Today it uses its considerable lobbying power to urge the government to overhaul its floundering public services, for example by pushing for investment to put an end to rolling electricity blackouts, in an attempt to salvage the country’s economic growth. It has spent more than $6bn (£4.8bn) in the country in the past five years, including investments in South Africa’s underfunded education system – De Beers has for decades sponsored students through university scholarships. “So many of us have grown up with the idea of ‘rapacious’ mining companies,” Lorimer said. “But in many ways these large listed companies make for better corporate citizens. As big international companies leave South Africa, we run the risk of attracting piratical players who are after profit and not much else.” Anglo was founded in 1917 by Ernest Oppenheimer, a German immigrant to London who first moved to Johannesburg at the turn of the century as a young diamond broker. He used £1m from UK and US investors to establish Anglo American and within 40 years it was the world’s largest producer of gold, while its twin, De Beers, commanded 90% of the world’s diamond trade. At the height of Anglo’s industrial power the business magnate also played a role in nudging South Africa’s apartheid government towards constitutional reform. Shortly before his death he offered discreet financial backing to the 156 anti-apartheid activists, including Nelson Mandela, who faced South Africa’s 1956 Treason Trials. His son, Harry Oppenheimer, assumed leadership of the company and took up his father’s brand of pragmatic liberalism in the late 1950s. He backed proposals for constitutional reform that would water down the ruling National party’s agenda of racial oppression – but he stopped short of supporting the ANC-led liberation movement’s calls for universal franchise. Still, the company was “indelibly connected” to South Africa’s political reformation, according to Michael Cardo, the author of a biography of Harry Oppenheimer and South Africa’s former shadow minister of employment until his resignation from politics in February. “Anglo is enmeshed with the history of South Africa in the 20th century – its industrial-economic development as well as its political evolution from a white supremacist state to a non-racial democracy,” he said. “It would be a matter of some consequence if this deal went through. It would be a significant loss for South Africa which could diminish its status as a major mining player on the world stage. It would speak to the state of South Africa today. The government could well see this deal as a massive blow to the dignity and self-worth of the country. It’s politically significant and speaks to South Africa’s status on the world stage.” With South Africa just weeks away from what is expected to be the closest democratic election in its history, the loss would be keenly political, too. Lorimer, who is part of the Democratic Alliance, said the deal exemplified the collapse of the economy under the ANC. “We used to have a world-leading mining industry, but now nobody wants to invest here,” he said.",

        "content": "When Rosemary Duff heard how long she would have to wait for a hip replacement operation on the NHS, she felt she had no choice but to dip into her savings. “I waited a month to see my GP, then another four months to see a consultant. His opening words were ‘unless you go private, there’s an 18-month waiting list’, which was a bit of a shock,” said Duff, 71, from Norwich. “Much against my principles, I agreed to go private.” Duff said her hips had started to play up after the first Covid lockdown, and she had physio through the NHS that had slowed down the deterioration. But a year ago she began experiencing increased pain, was not able to walk very far and struggled to get up the stairs. Duff, who worked in market research before retiring, spent almost £28,000 having both hips replaced last year at a private hospital run by Circle Health Group. “A lot of money out of my savings, but my children said I should go ahead and do it!” she said. The same consultant surgeon who advised her to go private then performed the surgery at the Clementine Churchill hospital in Harrow. Many consultants split their time between working for the NHS and the private sector, with rules in place aimed at avoiding conflicts of interest. Lengthening NHS waiting lists, which hit a peak of nearly 7.8 million in England in September, have prompted more people to take out private medical insurance in recent years, despite its rising cost. Others are dipping into savings or taking out loans to pay for routine operations, often spending thousands of pounds. The waiting list was still 7.5 million in February, compared with 4.6 million before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the British Medical Association, and close to half of the patients had been waiting for 18 weeks or longer. The waiting list is expected to “start to fall consistently but slowly from the middle of 2024”, the Institute for Fiscal Studies predicts – though it is likely to exceed pre-pandemic levels until 2030. Private hospitals were drafted in by the NHS during the pandemic to help with the surge in Covid admissions and only the most urgent operations were done, leaving a huge backlog of “non-urgent” procedures. But the NHS waiting list was already rising before the pandemic, as far back as 2018 – leading to a two-tier system where many people see no other option but to go private. To deal with the booming demand for private healthcare, insurers Axa and Aviva had to recruit and train significant numbers of extra call-centre staff last year. Discussing health conditions is not the same as making a motor claim, one senior insurance executive noted. Duff said: “I am now fully mobile again and feel like I have got my life back.” She keeps active – looking after her one-year-old granddaughter once a week, tending her allotment, walking and swimming. She is also secretary to the local Labour party. She inherited some money when her mother died last year, so the cost of the surgery “hasn’t completely wiped me out. But it has made a big hole.” She added: “What makes me so angry is that there are a lot of people out there who probably have jobs that they are dependent on that they’re no longer able to do, because they have joint health problems – their hips aren’t working. And it’s such an easy operation to sort things out.” More people are following Duff and paying out of their own pocket, despite the cost. A knee replacement typically costs between £12,000 and £15,000; a new hip costs between £9,000 and £16,500, and cataract removal between £2,000 and £4,000, according to 2023 figures from the health data provider LaingBuisson. Self-pay has increased to the point where it made up 28% of private hospitals’ revenue in 2022, including overseas patients, while procedures covered by medical insurance accounted for 41%, and payments from the NHS, which have tripled since 2003, accounted for 31%, says LaingBuisson. The struggling state health service has been buying cancer care, cardiology and other services from private hospital groups in recent years, prompting concerns about creeping backdoor privatisation. The private health sector has grown steadily: the combined turnover of private hospitals, primary care (GPs) and dental services has increased almost fourfold since 2010, from £1.3bn to £4.9bn in 2023, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows. The figures are not adjusted for inflation. Some say this trend, and the government’s unwillingness to fund the NHS adequately, increasingly undermines state healthcare. “You’ve now got more and more people who are having to pay out of their own pockets for things like dental care or operations that aren’t available on the NHS,” said David Rowland, director of the thinktank Centre for Health and the Public Interest. “You’ve got a trend there, which is the state government moving responsibility for paying for healthcare away from collective resources, taxpayer income, back on to the individual. Nobody’s being honest about the extent to which this is happening. No politician has stood up and advocated for it. It’s a trend which has been happening increasingly over the past 30 years with Labour, Conservative and Lib Dem parties in charge.” UK private healthcare is mainly provided by a handful of companies that run hospitals and GP and dental practices: Abu Dhabi-owned Circle Health Group and the FTSE 250 firm Spire Healthcare are the two biggest, followed by the US company HCA Healthcare and the UK charity Nuffield Health, and Australia’s Ramsay Healthcare.Spire’s revenues climbed 13% to £1.4bn last year and it made pre-tax profits of £34.6m, up from £3.9m in 2022 when the business was still recovering from the pandemic. Circle posted an £87m pre-tax loss in 2022, a deterioration on £51m the year before, partly due to one-off costs, according to the latest results filed with Companies House. It had revenues of more than £1bn. UK state spending on healthcare was £283bn in 2022, according to the ONS, up 0.7% from 2021. However, adjusting for the impact of inflation, spending declined by 4.5%. Further analysis by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development shows that the UK spent less on healthcare in 2022 as a percentage of GDP (11.3%) than the US (16.6%), Germany (12.7%) and France (12.1%). At the same time, the UK health cover market – including medical insurance and cash plans – has been growing much faster than in the past, reaching £6.7bn in 2022, up 6.1% from 2021, according to LaingBuisson. Despite the steep average annual cost of £2,252, more people have been forking out for individual medical insurance. Those who can get cover through their employers are much better off, with the average work policy costing £975. Among the growing number of people with private medical insurance is Lisa Maynard-Atem, 46, from Manchester, who is a freelancer and advises firms on digital marketing. She bought the insurance policy in May 2022. “We’ve all seen the issues with the NHS – and that’s no disrespect to the NHS, but obviously they are under a lot of pressure,” she said. “The services aren’t what they once were. I was just worried about waiting times. If there’s an emergency, I don’t want to have to wait. It’s my health: I want to get seen as soon as I possibly can.” Maynard-Atem has thought about cancelling her insurance but was glad she kept it when a dental filling fell out, resulting in pain and headaches. “The NHS dentist that I spoke to said it would be six weeks. I know I can’t wait six weeks. So I went to a private dentist and managed to get in straight away, but it cost me over £400.” She had a full filling and dental cleaning done, and got most of the cost back from her insurer, London-based Vitality, which is owned by South Africa’s Discovery. Following a dispute, she switched to Bupa, where she pays £113 a month for health cover. The main players in UK medical insurance are Bupa, Axa, Aviva and Vitality, which together control more than 90% of the market. Bupa, which dates back to 1947, a year before the birth of the NHS, has 3 million UK customers, Axa nearly 3 million, Aviva 1.2 million and Vitality 1 million. This means more than 8 million people are covered by private health insurance, both individual and workplace policies – more than one in 10 people in the UK. Even some smaller employers are now offering health insurance as a perk, in the realisation that if staff struggle to get medical treatment and are absent for longer, it ends up being more costly for the business. Liz Edwards of the personal finance comparison site finder.com said: “For many people, every day waiting for an operation is another day of pain or poor mobility or limited eyesight. There have been many stories of Brits using their savings to pay for treatment rather than face months while life is on hold.” Jess Rushton, 32, from Huddersfield, who works for the comparison site Smart Money People, has endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows elsewhere in the body, causing severe pelvic pain, problems getting pregnant and other issues. Her first operation was paid for by private health insurance via her previous employer, but when she changed jobs she found she could not obtain private cover for her condition. She paid for her last operation herself, at a cost of £6,000, through an interest-free loan with Omni Capital Retail Finance that had to be paid back within 10 months. The NHS would only offer her surgery if the condition became so debilitating that she could not work, she said. “The NHS won’t even consider surgery until I’m bedbound and unable to work, or turning up at A&amp;E three times a week,” Rushton said. “The NHS waiting list is so long; there are people that have got their whole lives on hold. Just to get a diagnosis takes eight years because it [endometriosis] gets misdiagnosed as so many different things.” She and her partner are saving up for her third surgery in the next 18 to 36 months, which is likely to cost £12,000, because it is more complex and medical costs have gone up. She has also been diagnosed with adenomyosis, where the lining of the womb starts growing into the muscle in the wall of the womb. “My uterus and ovaries were stuck to my hip last time, and I was starting to get really bad mobility problems,” she said. “One of the problems with endometriosis is you are likely to have to have an operation every three to five years in order to remove the tissue because it continues to grow. It can grow anywhere, so it affects my bowels, my bladder – that’s different scans and different operations. So it’s pretty uninsurable.” The pandemic has added to pressure on the health service, with mental health worsening in recent years. Axa Health, which was founded in 1940 as the Association for Hospital Services, and was acquired by the French company Axa in 1999, said demand for mental wellbeing coverage had surged by 160% since 2020. Axa said customers were now making 55,000 digital GP appointments a month compared with 17,000 before the pandemic. Claims for muscles, bones and joints remain high, as well as for cancer treatment, digestive health, and skincare treatments, which are hard to obtain quickly on the NHS. People are making more frequent health claims for anything from physiotherapy to more expensive surgeries, according to Aviva boss Amanda Blanc. The rise in claims, coupled with higher medical costs caused by higher wage and energy bills, is driving up insurance premiums. Insurers are pushing through rises of between 10% and 40% this year, with more increases likely in coming years, according to LaingBuisson. Insurers recognised that this could push health cover beyond the bounds of affordability and were developing more modular products, said Tim Read, LaingBuisson’s head of research. These will allow people to pick and choose parts of their cover – dropping, for example, cancer coverage, which would reduce costs. “Cancer coverage is what adds a fair bit of money into the cost of a premium,” he said. The NHS crisis will be a key issue in the general election, and a tough inheritance for the next government. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, has defended Labour’s plans to use the private sector to help cut the NHS backlog, arguing that a failure to do so would result in a “betrayal” of working-class people who cannot afford to pay for private care. Streeting also told the Guardian that the NHS would be privatised “over my dead body”, adding that his longer-term ambition was for no one to be forced to pay and for the NHS not to rely on private care at all. Read said: “It’s hard to see what levers a new Labour government can pull to bring down the NHS waiting list quickly … so over five or six years, maybe, we’ll get down to more manageable levels. “But in the meantime, the private health cover market is likely to grow, and perhaps by that point people will be much more au fait with the idea of paying out of pocket for some things, or for insurance.”",

        "title": "Less work for the same pay won’t fly – but here’s a four-day week that might",
        "content": "According to CNN “4-day workweeks may be around the corner. A third of America’s companies are exploring them.” CNBC says: “This US company tested a 4-day workweek – and says it made workers happier and more productive.” Newsweek tells us: “Millennials Are Ready For a Four-Day Week.” So why do all of my clients say nope? According to an advocacy organization, more than 300 companies have four-day workweeks and, per the reports above, many others are apparently “testing” the concept. I admit that I’ve spoken to none of these companies but I’m not sure I have to. I spend my life working with small and mid-sized businesses and I know a PR stunt when I see one. Hey, good for them. In these times of tight labor - it’s a great marketing campaign. “People! Come work for us except you don’t have to do as much work and we’ll still pay you the same!” Now that’s a company I want to work for. But ask any business owner about the four-day workweek and you’ll get the eye-roll. No employer who’s currently paying a worker $1,000 a week for 40 hours is going to agree to pay that same worker the same amount for a 32-hour week. My firm has 600 clients. These companies slit paper, coat films, design strip malls, buy and sell auto parts online, mow lawns and repair roofs. They’re mostly owned by people who wake up at 5am and work till 7pm. They don’t have enough people to do the work needed. They don’t have enough money to pay for good health insurance, let alone a robot. Their parking lots need resurfacing, their internet needs upgrading and their coffee pots need to be replaced by Keurigs. These businesses – like most their size - suffer when a single person calls out sick. Their owners are battling customers who don’t pay, suppliers who don’t deliver and services that don’t function. My little subset of clients – who represent a tiny sliver of the country’s 30m businesses – can’t fathom a four-day workweek. To them, this is a fairytale, a dream, a misguided workplace concept driven by media interest that is so unrealistic that few even pay attention to the stories about it. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a place for the four-day workweek. All this idea needs is a little bit of rebranding. If you’re an advocate of the four-day workweek you’re going about this all wrong. Instead of working fewer hours for the same pay – which, again let me confirm, is never going to happen – you should be pushing for changes in work schedules. Many industries – like healthcare, home services and retail – allow flexibility in scheduling so that workers put in four 10-hour days and then have three days off. I know younger workers who have this arrangement at their employers and they love it. Working a 10-hour shift isn’t that much different than an eight-hour shift, but having three days off in a week makes a big difference. This is the kind of four-day workweek an employer should embrace. Allowing your people more flexibility in their scheduling satisfies a very reasonable (and admirable) value championed by today’s younger generations to have a better work-life balance. They’re right about this and smarter than my generation. By adopting a more flexible 10-hour-day schedule your company can tout its own “four-day workweek” program to current and prospective employees and leverage the current news cycle to help retain and attract more talent. There will always be wily politicians who will take up silly causes like the four-day workweek to fire up their base. There will always be companies aiming to grab the headlines. But here’s the reality: workers who think that corporate America is going to a four-day workweek anytime soon are dreaming. It’s not going to happen. Not in the foreseeable future. Probably not ever. It simply doesn’t make economic sense. But employers can be more flexible and should be if they want to recruit the best talent. That’s the kind of “four-day” workweek that does make sense to a businessperson.",

        "title": "Blackpool rock maker leads crusade to protect British seaside staple",
        "content": "Today, Parma Violet, bubblegum and salted caramel flavours are being made. On other days, it could be banoffee pie, hot chilli, the nuclear-strength super sour or, for an afterwork treat, Jägerbomb-flavoured rock. At a small factory making Blackpool rock, the flavours might be different from previous generations but the techniques and skills are the same as they were 60 years ago. Stepping inside the Stanton &amp; Novelty factory in Blackpool is like entering a time capsule. The smell of burnt sugar is intense. Big splodges of colourful hot toffee are like abstract artworks. Workers handroll 30ft-long snakes of the almost finished rock, which are cut into sticks and wrapped by people, not a machine. One of the newest things in the factory is the boss, 34-year-old David Thorp, who was working in recruitment in London when, seven years ago, he had to decide whether to take on the family business, set up by his grandfather in 1969. He did and has managed to get through Covid, rampant energy bills and increasing material costs but now faces, he said, the biggest threat of all: cheap imitation imports from China. This week, Thorp coordinated a letter to parliamentarians signed by all 10 manufacturers in the town, a rare show of unity for businesses that are fierce competitors. They are embarking on a campaign for Blackpool rock to be given geographical protection, the same as Stilton cheese and Melton Mowbray pork pies have. Rock has been a seaside staple for more than a century but most people don’t know that almost all of it is made in Blackpool. It is something of a dying art, said Thorp. Only 30 people in the UK have the knowledge and skills to set the letters that run through it. Three of them are at Stanton &amp; Novelty and they include Thorp. “It is a really intricate process and might take you five years to know how to do it well,” he said. “You’re dealing with toffee that’s still really hot and unpredictable and constantly sagging because it’s warm. There are 1,001 things that can go wrong.” So much of the process is done by hand. It begins with sugar, glucose and water being boiled in a copper pot to a precise temperature of 300F (149C). “If you go a couple of degrees too high, you ruin the boiling,” said Thorp. “A couple of degrees too low and you ruin the boiling.” The toffee is then coloured and flavoured and thinned by hand. “It’s not something a machine can do. It is all done by experience, you need to know the exact thickness as you’re pulling it … it’s basically like a tug of war for about half-an-hour.” Setting the letters in the rock is also an involved, fraught process which can easily go wrong. “No machine can put the letters through a stick of rock, it has to be done by hand,” said Thorp. “You’ve got to think of a letter in 3D. As well as being 3D the letter has to be two feet long.” The process involves folding sheets of coloured workable sugar into the shape of letters that have white sugar in the centre. They are then covered in more white sugar, encased in whatever colours are on the outside and squeezed and rolled into the sticks. “You’ve also got to use white strips to make sure a letter doesn’t blend into the next one,” Thorp said. The rock is cut and wrapped by hand and it has to be that way, added Thorp. “You wouldn’t get the twisted ends and a machine can’t get the label under the wrapper. It can only add a sticker, which doesn’t look anywhere near as good.” Blackpool rock’s origins date back to the 19th century and “fair rock”, which was sold at fairgrounds when sugar was cheap and abundant. According to some, rock with letters through it was the brainchild of an ex-miner from Burnley, Ben Bullock, who then made it in Dewsbury with the first printed words being “Whoa Emma”, the title of a popular music hall song. Others say it was a man called “Dynamite” Dick Taylor, from Morecambe. Whatever the origins, it is now firmly Blackpool rock, although for how much longer is the pressing question. There were once 30 factories making rock in the town and now there are 10. Next year, Thorp said, there will be eight. The campaigners are applying to UK geographical protected food names schemes and had been hoping to receive support and advice from local MPs. The problem has been that one was Scott Benton, who was suspended and then resigned, and another is the Fylde MP Mark Menzies, who is quitting following allegations of misusing campaign funds. It explains the reason for ignored emails, said Thorp. The third local MP is the former defence secretary Ben Wallace, but he is also standing down at the next election. Those hurdles are not deterring Thorp, who said he didn’t want to wake up one day and ask himself why they didn’t fight harder. On a normal day, Stanton &amp; Novelty will make about 26 miles of rock and Thorp is determined this will continue. His proud mum Jan said the passion was typical of her son. “If you chopped David in half, it would say Blackpool rock,” she said.",

        "title": "From welfare to warfare: Sunak’s spending shift imperils local services again",
        "content": "Talking tough on “sicknote culture”, stopping the boats and offering billions of pounds extra for defence spending. Ahead of local elections in England and Wales this week, Rishi Sunak has been in campaign overdrive. With the prime minister suffering the joint-lowest satisfaction rating of any Conservative or Labour leader since 1978, experts are predicting a drubbing for the Tories, with the party expected to lose as many as half the seats it is contesting. The prominent Tory mayors in the West Midlands and Tees Valley, Andy Street and Ben Houchen, could be ejected from power. It comes at a time of financial crisis for England’s system of local government, with more local authorities going bust in the past three years than in the previous three decades. Levelling up is all but abandoned; transformed from a flagship government promise to an afterthought. Yet, in the policy blitz before the local elections, the prime minister’s priorities have clearly been focused elsewhere as he offers rightwing red meat to Tory rebels who could use poor local election results as a prompt to try to replace him. Sunak’s focus on welfare changes, the Rwanda bill and extra cash for the military is not though without consequence for local government, at a time when England’s town halls are crying out for more funding after years of austerity and the fallout from economic headwinds hitting their budgets. Experts on public finances warn that raising the defence budget from 2% of national income to 2.5% by 2030 will mean difficult trade offs for government. One of three outcomes is required: higher taxes; adding to borrowing; or cutting expenditure elsewhere. Sunak, however, is not seriously engaging in these trade offs. The prime minister has said his plan is fully funded, by switching research and development funding elsewhere for the military, alongside a 70,000 reduction in civil service headcount. Economists, however, warn the numbers simply don’t add up. Reducing expenditure on warfare over recent decades had helped allow for an expansion in the welfare state, labelled by economists as a “peace dividend” in the public finances. In recent times, however, weak economic growth and spending pressures from an ageing population have made this balancing act much harder. Reversing the decline in military spending will mean adding to these headwinds yet further. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the beefed-up defence settlement means unprotected government departments will face real-terms cuts of about 4% a year after 2025 – equivalent to about two-thirds of the cuts imposed at the peak of George Osborne’s post-2010 austerity drive. The Institute for Government warns that such “fictitious” spending assumptions undermine the quality of fiscal debate, and threaten the government’s credibility with the public finances when those policies are inevitably changed. If the prime minister does follow the logical conclusion that spending cuts are required to balance the books, local government is most likely to be the hardest hit – following the pattern of the 2010s, when grant funding was slashed by 40%. Councils are, however, already under intense pressure, as the cuts collide with the recent period of sky-high inflation, and as their services come under growing pressure from an ageing and increasingly unwell population. Despite ministers adding an extra £600m to top up council funding plans for this year, MPs and council leaders from across the political divide say local authorities are still £4bn short in an “out of control” financial crisis. That’s even after a bumper £2bn increase in council tax this spring, tacitly approved by ministers, which means residents will end up paying more for services that are getting worse. Ministers have sought to blame problems in certain local authorities on mismanagement and incompetence, rather than admit any responsibility. There are legitimate grievances in several authorities, where councillors dealt an awful hand by government bet the farm on risky commercial projects in their gamble to survive and lost badly. This week the blame game in the West Midlands will go into overdrive as the region’s Tory metro mayor, Andy Street, aims to make political capital out of Birmingham’s effective bankruptcy under a Labour administration. However, it’s noticeable the former John Lewis boss is also distancing himself from Sunak before Thursday’s vote. In contrast, Labour prioritised a response to the councils crisis at the launch of its local election campaign, saying it would offer longer-term funding settlements, more devolution, and an end to the “begging bowl culture” of forcing local authorities to bid for centralised pots of cash. All good things, but without much extra financial firepower they risk being inadequate for the scale of the challenge. This week, the prime minister might have bought himself a little time against his party rebels. But it is at the expense of Britain’s rapidly crumbling public realm.",

        "content": "Now, let me get this straight. We have a fissiparous, Brexit-supporting government, many of whose MPs are stepping down, convinced that their party is heading for its wilderness years. Correspondingly, we have a Labour opposition that is riding high in the polls, led by Keir Starmer, who – unlike his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn – played a noble part in the remain campaign and argued passionately for a second referendum. Proponents of a second referendum hoped that the country would acknowledge its historic mistake, and return to the European Union it should never have left. I was one of them. We failed. Since that failure, what we were worried would manifest itself has indeed manifested itself. Brexit is an economic disaster, with the Office for Budget Responsibility and National Institute of Social and Economic Research estimating the hit to the nation’s GDP at anything between 4% and 6%. There are daily reports now of the bureaucratic disruption at customs to what was once the ordinary course of business for small and medium-sized firms. Exports and imports alike are affected. There are mounting supply chain shortages; costs are rising as a direct result of Brexit, with more disruption to come. Farmers who voted for Brexit now regret not having been more careful about what they wished for. As for those famous trade deals, promised as substitutes for deals with our nearest and largest market, they have been replaced by – er, well, let’s face it, they have not been replaced. It’s pathetic: a national example of self-harm that makes us an international laughing stock. But the disaster is not just about business, trade and the economy. It embraces people’s rights, privileges and opportunities – made possible, indeed taken for granted, via our membership of the EU. This is especially bad for the young, not least for the 60% of 18- to 24-year-olds who, surveys indicate, think leaving the EU was a mistake. Defeatists tend to say that the EU would not want us back. Certainly they would want to deal with trustworthy people, which Boris Johnson and co were not. But they too are troubled by the consequences of Brexit – although, as I have said before, they know that what has happened to Britain has acted as a brake on potential leavers in the remaining EU nations. But what happens when the EU offers an olive branch – a plan for 18- to 30-year-olds in all member countries and the UK to be able to work and study throughout the EU for up to four years? Rishi Sunak rejects it immediately, and Labour follows suit with all that guff about “red lines”. Now, wait for it, the reductio ad absurdum of Labour’s position is this: we are told that it will fight the coming election on the Conservatives’ “economic failure”, not on Brexit. This is, I think, a classic example of what my philosopher friends term a “category mistake”. Brexit constitutes an integral part of this government’s economic failure. Highlighting that failure, and promising to reverse it, should be central to Labour’s strategy. The fact of the matter is that Starmer was right about Brexit, and the Brexiters who captured the Tory party were wrong. I gather that there are rejoin candidates in the imminent local elections. It might strengthen Starmer’s arm if they do well. It is a commonplace that the British economy is suffering from years of underinvestment, and that this has undoubtedly affected its productivity. There are too many international comparisons from which the UK emerges poorly. In part, the situation resembles the way that successive Conservative and Labour governments in the 1950s and 1960s were concerned about what was known as “relative decline” and decided that one way of dealing with this was to join what was then the Common Market. Association agreements were not enough. We needed the full works. After several failed attempts, we entered the European Economic Community in 1973, and that evolved into the EU, with the added benefit of the formation of the internal – single – market, in whose formation we played a crucial role. That gave a vital boost to our economic performance. Now, at a time when there are so many repair jobs to be addressed, but endless complaints about the cost, UK plc needs another boost, and what Keynes called the “animal spirits” of entrepreneurs require a shot in the arm. In my view, a more confident Starmer could provide that if he ceased being mesmerised by “red wall” Brexiters and returned to first principles. Most people now regard Brexit as a serious mistake. Re-entry would be good for investment – and for growth and tax revenue. As the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney puts it: “‘Take back control’ was actually code for ‘tear down your future.’”",

        "content": "A Waitrose billboard erected in a wonky fashion as a marketing stunt was fenced off by council staff amid public safety fears. The retailer erected an askew billboard on Lindore Road, in Wandsworth, south-west London, in a nod to its falling prices. The billboard, depicting a downwards arrow flanked either side by food items, was accompanied bytext that read: “Well, this is good – new lower prices on hundreds of your favourites.” While the message to customers was that prices were on the way down, this did not translate across the board, with public concern prompting Wandsworth council to erect fencing around the billboard. The move provoked a lighthearted reaction from the retailer on X. In a post, which tagged the council, it said: “Thanks for the swift action but while our prices are falling rapidly, our billboard certainly isn’t!” In a separate post to the official Specsavers X account, Waitrose asked: “One for you guys?” The council confirmed to the Guardian on Saturday that the barriers had since been removed. A council spokesperson said: “We were alerted to this unusual advert by a concerned member of the public and while we could see it might be deliberately set up to look that way, we thought ot better not take any chances with public safety so put up some barriers to be on the safe side. “Once we’d spoken to Waitrose and established it was designed to look this way we removed the barriers straight away.” Earlier this month Waitrose announced plans to reduce the price of more than 200 “weekly shop” products. This is the fifth time the retailer, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership, has announced cuts since February 2023. It has reportedly invested £130m over this period. Following the latest round of cuts, the Waitrose commercial director, Charlotte Di Cello, said: “We are focusing on even more weekly-shop staples as well as a large range of organic ingredients which our customers love. “We continue to offer market-leading quality on our higher welfare products, such as chicken and outdoor-bred pork alongside our best seasonal fruit and vegetables.”",

        "title": "Three and a bit years after Brexit, are border checks finally here? ",
        "content": "When Michael Gove announced the first delay to post-Brexit checks on plant and animal products coming into Great Britain from the EU, he was keen to make one thing clear. “Although we recognise that many in the border industry and many businesses have been investing time and energy to be ready on time, and indeed we in government were confident of being ready on time,” the then minister for the Cabinet Office said, “we have listened to businesses who have made a strong case that they need more time to prepare.” That was in March 2021. Three years and four delays later, Tuesday will finally see those checks brought in. Or will it? This time there are question marks over the government’s readiness. In a leaked presentation seen by the Financial Times, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) outlined a plan to phase in controls, with physical inspections initially “set to zero” for all but the highest-risk products. The government hit back, insisting that checks would be commencing on 30 April, but indicated that they would focus initially on higher-risk products, and scale up checks on other goods in a “sensible and controlled way”. MPs want an explanation, writing to Defra last week to say this appears to be “a sixth delay to the implementation of [plant and animal products] import checks in all but name”. The Observer understands the inspection process will begin with more “intelligence-led” checks, focusing first on the highest risk products in all categories. This would see consignments chosen for inspection based on factors such as the country of origin and the company delivering them, and any additional intelligence on certain products coming through the border. The enforcement levels will also be adjusted based on compliance of goods and disruption levels. This is a scaling-down from the stated plan, which aimed to check between 1% and 30% of medium-risk goods, including meat, cheese, eggs and fish, from 30 April, and 100% of high-risk goods, which includes plants for planting and live animals. The government said it intended to build up to this level of checks but has yet to give a timeline. This second phase of the post-Brexit border policy, called the border target operating model (BTOM), is designed to mirror the checks the EU introduced on imports from Great Britain immediately after the UK left the single market in January 2021. The first phase, which began at the end of January this year, required importers of most meat, dairy and plant to secure health certificates for products before they could enter Great Britain. This has already created problems for some importers. Not only has it added extra costs to orders – the certificates can cost up to £200 for each product line – but some suppliers have struggled to find vets to carry out the checks or simply turned their backs on supplying the UK, unwilling to deal with the added bureaucracy. The result has been gaps on some deli shelves. The move to physical checks will be more disruptive. Inspections will involve some lorries being held at the border. When the EU began controlling imports in 2021, UK exporters were left counting the cost of containers of meat rotting in European ports. The government has said the checks will enhance the country’s biosecurity, and protect farmers and the country’s food security from costly diseases. World Trade Organization rules state that UK trade borders with the EU need to match those with the rest of the world, so as not to give the bloc a trading advantage. But trade will be more costly. The government itself has admitted that businesses will have to pay £330m a year, which could add 0.2% to food inflation over three years. A recent Allianz Trade report put the cost as high as £2bn, with a 0.2% increase in headline national inflation. Ministers insist a phased start to physical checks was the plan all along, but businesses have told the Observer it was news to them. So, while we may not be about to see long tailbacks or stacks of rotting meat at the border, if history is anything to go by, it won’t be the smoothest – or quickest – move to a fully biosecure border. • This article was amended on 2 May 2024.

        "content": "The south Asian high street is facing a fight for its future in Britain as customers scale back wedding celebrations because of the cost of living crisis and young people’s changing preferences. Businesses in London and Manchester have said they have witnessed a huge decline in customers after the pandemic with the cost of living crisis prompting many to decide against the traditional big south Asian wedding and to seek out cheaper products online. Ankush Puri opened his south Asian clothing store in the west London district of Southall, nicknamed “Little India”, in 1993. He had moved to the UK from India five years prior and was among several other budding entrepreneurs with their sights on the growing south Asian retail market in the UK. “Things have changed completely since 1995. In 2024, things are completely different, people are selling online, they’re selling for low prices and shopkeepers have got expenses … the rents and rates are higher but your profits are low and you can’t cope,” he said. The decline of Britain’s high street has been well documented in recent years, owing to online shopping, rising inflation and lack of investment. Yet the south Asian retail market has remained extraordinarily resilient, meeting the needs and desires of the country’s growing south Asian population, and offering customers garments, such as saris, lehenga cholis and salwar kameezes, that would otherwise be impossible to find on a typical British high street. Puri, like many other business owners, has attempted to adapt by launching an online business, DesiSarees.com, and shifting from selling women’s garments to men’s. But, almost 30 years on from opening his store, Puri said he is still struggling to turn a good profit. “I feel upset about it, actually, because we all work hard. Everyone works seven days a week and we should get some kind of good response business-wise, which we are not getting. That’s why it makes you upset” he said. Some business owners are more optimistic. Bob Balu, chair of the Soho Road Business Improvement District (BID), said the high street in Birmingham has remained “constantly busy”. Balu said the BID has invested in campaigns and advertisements across south Asian radio stations and TV channels to encourage more shoppers to the Midlands, marketing Soho Road as a “one stop wedding centre”. However, he acknowledged that business owners are noticing customers opting for smaller wedding functions after the pandemic – a stark contrast to the typical big south Asian wedding – or not having them at all. “There’s not one factor that could be said. I think it’s just a build up … weddings are down, kids are not getting married young, they’re getting married in their 30s. There’s so many factors and the cost of living is affecting it,” he said. “What we’re trying to say is, where there were probably 10 brides, there’s probably five. But we want those five to come here.” One shop owner, who did not want to be identified, criticised the local council for not doing more to meet the needs of shoppers. “When I came to Southall, it was quite a booming market. It’d be very hard to find a premises but over these past five years, things have had a major effect … Now, you can find lots of empty shops, you can find lots of empty units. “The amount of people that come to Southall, they need parking, they need toilets, they need facilities, which, instead of providing more, have been taken away … It seems that the council is not really putting the shoppers first.” Poonam Millin, whose family set up one of the first south Asian retail stores in Manchester in the 1970s, Alankar Sarees, said she has noticed a “huge decline” in the number of customers entering her store in the past six months. “The kind of trade we get on a daily basis [has] kind of really cut down. You might get one customer in the morning and one in the evening and then you could be free for the afternoon. Whereas several years ago, we’d have a constant flow of people in the store.” She added: “I think even the consequences of leaving the European Union which people haven’t realised, which have led to other costs. The cost of shipping our goods in, the rising costs in India, the costs of our electricity, our rent, our rates, have all gone up significantly but yet people’s budgets have tightened.” An Ealing council spokesperson said: “Supporting Southall’s small businesses to thrive and harnessing investment to create well paid jobs is a key priority for Ealing council through our Good for Ealing inward investment programme. “New public toilets are planned and are likely to be near Southall Broadway at an accessible location.” • This article was amended on 29 April 2024. An earlier version incorrectly referenced “Southall council” rather than Ealing council.",

        "title": "FTSE 100 ends ‘fantastic week’ at new record high, as Anglo rejects takeover bid – as it happened",
        "content": "As City investors celebrate the FTSE 100’s best week in seven months, it’s time to wrap up. Here’s today’s main stories so far… Newsflash: Britain’s FTSE 100 share index has ended a dramatic week at a new record high. The Footsie has finished today’s session at a new closing high of 8139 points, up 61 points or 0.75% today. It had earlier hit a fresh intraday high of 8146.79 points. This wraps up a string of record intraday and closing highs this week; ironically, given concerns that the London stock market was loosing its alure as some companies eye a shift to New York and others face takeover approaches. For the week, the FTSE 100 gained 3% – a decent score, for an index which has lagged international rivals in recent years. Indeed, it’s the best week for the FTSE 100 since last September. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: “What a fantastic week for the FTSE 100. We’ve had new record highs, yet more takeover action, and everyone is talking about UK stocks in a positive way which hasn’t been seen for ages. There was no stopping the blue-chip index on Friday as NatWest’s results went down well and we saw gains across most of the market. The breadth of sectors moving higher suggests investor sentiment continues to improve.” NatWest bank led the risers today, gaining 6% after reporting higher profits than expected for the first quarter of the year. Industrial equipment rental firm Ashtead was the second-highest rise, up Y after HSBC analysts raised their rating. They were followed by Anglo American, which gained another 3.8% today after slapping down rival BHP Group’s takeover offer this morning. Traders clearly suspect a higher bid will be needed, or that other suiters could enter the ring…. Relief that Alphabet and Microsoft posted strong results last night have also cheered investors in Europe today. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, reckons the FTSE 100 may have further to climb, She says: We think that there is a psychological shift going on in the mind of international investors, and they are starting to warm to UK stocks. There is a dual boom going on in the global economy right now: AI/ tech and commodities. The UK index may be light on tech, but it has a lot of exposure to miners and energy companies. Copper hit $10,000 a tonne on Friday, and commodities have had a strong run so far this year. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized shares jumped 1.1% today, led by Darktrace wihich gained 16% after agreeing a $5.3bn (£4.2bn) sale to US private equity business Thoma Bravo. The UK’s FTSE 100 index is ending the week on a bit of a tear. The index of the largest companies listed in London has hit a fresh intraday high of 8146 points this afternoon, and is on track for a new closing high too….. UK consumer sentiment deteriorated during April, the latest data from the University of Michigan shows. The Michigan consumer confidence index has dropped to 77.2 for this month, down from 79.4 in March, and lower than the 77.9 recorded in early April. The survey also found that Americans’ inflation expectations have ticked up. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu explains: The long-run business outlook inched up to reach its highest reading since June 2021, while views of personal finances softened. Different parts of the population exhibited offsetting changes this month. Republicans posted notable declines in sentiment this month, whereas Democrats and Independents did not. Sentiment for younger consumers rose, in contrast to middle-aged and older adults whose sentiment changed little or fell. Back in the London market, Anglo American’s shares are rallying, up 3.5%. Traders are piling into Anglo again, after it rejected BHP’s takeover offer this morning for significantly undervaluing it. The rally comes as the Financial Times reports that US activist hedge fund Elliott Management has built a $1bn stake in Anglo in recent months. Google’s parent company Alphabet has hit a $2 trillion valuation, again, after reporting a surge in profits last night and announcing its first dividend. Alphabet’s shares have jumped by 10% in early trading, lifting its value over the $2tn figure – a landmark it also passed in November 2021. They’re up 10.5% at $172.50. Last night, before Alphabet’s results, they had closed at $156.00, valuing the tech giant at $1.95trn. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: “Alphabet joining the ranks of tech companies paying dividends is a sign of the times. “Big tech firms have enjoyed stellar growth over the past decade and while most remain highly innovative, their cash flows have become so strong that there’s oodles of money left over post-reinvestment in the business to reward shareholders. It’s not that they’ve been tight on cash before, it’s just that previously share buybacks were seen as the preferred way to deploy surplus money. US National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard insists the Biden administration is trying to bring inflation down, after today’s PCE data showed prices rising faster than the Fed’s 2% target. In a statement issued by the White House, Brainard says: While inflation has fallen more than 60% from its peak, today’s report reinforces the importance of our ongoing work to bring costs down. President Biden is fighting to lower the biggest bills families face. The President has secured legislation to lower costs for health care, prescription drugs, and insulin. He has called on Congress to pass his plan to lower housing costs by building one million new homes. And he is banning hidden junk fees and calling on corporations with record profits to pass their savings on to consumers. That’s a sharp contrast with Congressional Republicans, who are fighting for measures that raise costs for health care, housing, and utility bills while cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. Today’s rise in the PCE inflation measure shows that hopes of cuts to US interest rates as early as June were too optimistic, says Christopher Breen, head of economic insight at the Centre for Economics and Business Research: Breen explains: “US PCE inflation rose to 2.7% in March, meaning it is no lower now than it was in November. It is, therefore, becoming clearer that previous expectations for a rate cut in June have proved too optimistic. The increasing market-implied probabilities for a rate hike seem like an overreaction, especially given the slowdown in growth seen in Q1, which may indicate that the economy is finally coming off the boil. Cebr currently expects the first rate cut in July, with a cautious approach to loosening policy further over this year and next. On a monthly basis, both the PCE price index and the core PCE price index increased by 0.3% during March. That’s a fairly brisk pace of price rises, which may encourage Federal Reserve policymakers to hold off from lowering interest rates until later this year. The Fed is due to set rates next Wednesday, and is widely expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged. Just in: The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation rate has risen. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) rate rose to 2.7% in March, up from 2.5% in February, and higher than the 2.6% which economists expected. That may suggest that inflationary pressures are building in the US, after consumer price inflation also rose last month. However, the Fed will be more relieved to see that core PCE (which strips out food and energy) was unchanged at 2.8% per year. The GMB is taking legal action against Amazon in the long-running battle for recognition at its Coventry warehouse, accusing the US firm of trying to “induce” staff to leave the union. An employment tribunal claim is being lodged on behalf of five workers at the large site, known as BHX4. The GMB cites practices including anti-union messages appearing on message boards, and workers being called into meetings lasting an hour or more, at which they claim managers are critical of unions. They say QR codes have also been displayed around the building, which, when scanned by a staff member, automatically generate an email to the GMB’s membership department, cancelling their membership. Amanda Gearing, a GMB senior organiser, said: “This is a company out of control. Amazon is a multibillion-pound corporation, doing everything in its power to stop minimum wage workers from forming a union.” More here: After enjoying surging profits after the Ukraine invasion, oil companies are now seeing their earnings slide – although they’re still raking billions each quarter. Exxon Mobile has reported that it made profits of $8.2bn in the first quarter of 2024, down more than $3bn on the $11.43bn it made a year before. Exxon says: Earnings decreased as industry refining margins and natural gas prices came down from last year’s highs to trade within the ten-year historical range. It’s a similar story at Chevron, which today reported earnings of $5.5bn for the first quarter 2024, compared with $6.6bn in January-March 2023. Chevron attributes the drop in earnings to lower margins on refined product sales and lower natural gas realizations. Mike Wirth, Chevron’s chairman and chief executive officer, says: “U.S. production was up 35 percent from a year ago, and we continued to meet major project milestones.” Over in Moscow, the Russia’s central bank has left interest rates on hold at 16% today. Announcing the decision, the Bank of Russia says that inflationary pressures are gradually easing but remain high. And it warned that it will take longer than expected to bring inflation down to its 4% target, from 7.7% in March. The Bank of Russia says: Due to the remaining elevated domestic demand, which outstrips the capabilities to expand supply, inflation will return to the target somewhat more slowly than the Bank of Russia forecast in February. The rouble has nudged a one-month high against the US dollar, at 91.79 to the dollar. Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský has bought a fifth of German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp’s steel business, sending its shares surging today. Křetínský, dubbed the “Czech Sphinx” for his enigmatic, low-profile approach to business, has bought 20% of Thyssenkrupp’s steel operations though his holding company EPCG. The two sides are in talks about the sale of another 30%, to create a 50-50 joint venture. This is a breakthrough for Thyssenkrupp, which has been trying to divest the unit for several years. Its shares have jumped 8.25% so far today. The Wall Street Journal reports that while financial terms weren’t disclosed, baader analyst Christian Obst has said Thyssenkrupp could receive between €350m and €400m for the 20% stake, assuming there are no further write-downs in the business. Earlier this month Křetínský made a £3bn takeover offer for Royal Mail’s parent company, having built up a 27.5% stake. He was born in communist Czechoslovakia in 1975, the son of a judge and a computer science professor, and built up an empire of European energy companies, snapping up fossil fuel assets. Copper prices in London hit a two-year high today, Reuters reports, highlighting why BHP is so keen to get its hands on Anglo American’s copper mines. Copper hit the $10,000 a metric ton mark, after prices in Shanghai hit record levels. Traders are betting that copper production will struggle to keep up with high demand for the metal, which is vital for the energy transition. ING commodities analyst Ewa Manthey explaims: “Speculation over supply shortfalls in copper are pushing prices to new highs. At the same time, investors are turning optimistic about demand from the green energy sector. BHP’s bid for Anglo American highlights the looming supply squeeze.” NatWest has announced that the government’s stake in the bank has dipped below 28%. The Treasury’s holding in NatWest has fallen to 27.93%, down from 28.90%, as part of the ongoing trading plan which began in August 2021. At its peak, the UK owned of around 84% of the bank, when it was known as Royal Bank of Scotland and was rescued in the 2008 banking crisis. The government is planning to offer its shares in NatWest to the general public this summer. NatWest Group, CEO Paul Thwaite told reporters this morning: “Returning NatWest Group to private ownership is a shared ambition and one that we believe is in the best interests of the bank and all our shareholders.” Regular polling by the Office for National Statistics, tracking public attitudes to the big issues of the day, has been released today. For some time the cost of living crisis has topped the poll, and the latest figures for the period 10 April to 21 April show no change there. When asked about the important issues facing the UK today, the most commonly reported concern was surprisingly still the cost of living (87%), followed by the NHS (86%) and the economy (70%). It’s a blow for the government that steeply falling inflation has had little effect on public attitudes. Average pay has risen more quickly than prices over recent months, but it would seem that the dramatic price increases of the last three years continue to leave people feeling worse off. A fall in inflation only limits and does not reverse prices growth. The ONS said other commonly reported issues were climate change and the environment (61%), housing (55%), crime (55%), immigration (51%) and international conflict (50%). Some happy news: insolvencies among both individuals and companies fell last month. The number of registered company insolvencies in England and Wales dropped to 1,815 in March, which is 17% lower than in February and than in March 2023. The Insolvency Service reports that insolvencies fell across the board last month, with 261 compulsory liquidations, 1,437 creditors’ voluntary liquidations (CVLs), 108 administrations and 9 company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) in March. The fall in insolvencies is surprising, given the pressures that businesses face from high interest rates, weak economic growth and squeezed consumers. Trevor Wood, partner and insolvency specialist at international law firm Vedder Price, fears it may be a blip, though. He explains: Today’s figures are extraordinary. I don’t think anyone will have been expecting a fall in insolvencies. All the signs on the ground were that insolvencies would rise as businesses continue to struggle to adjust to the high interest rate environment, which has ratcheted up operating costs and caused real funding issues for struggling companies. The reality seems to be that businesses and investors have managed to adjust, cutting their cloth successfully to match the economic climate. This is a real bolt from the blue – but a welcome one. David Hudson, restructuring advisory partner at FRP, says: “High levels of insolvency were already baked into expectations for this year so any sign of a slowdown in volume is welcome. That said, with economic growth remaining weak and many pausing investment in anticipation of a General Election, it’s highly likely that more businesses – many still saddled with post-Covid debts – will falter under the weight of elevated input and borrowing costs. The Insolvency Services has also reported that 8,708 individuals entered insolvency in England &amp; Wales in March 2024, 19% lower than in February 2024 and 9% lower than in March 2023. Darktrace’s takeover is “the same story” of an undervalued UK asset being taken out, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com: Something has come loose in the UK market, like a hose pipe that was blocked up suddenly gushing forth. Another deal announced today for Darktrace and another record high for the FTSE 100. Nick Train suggested a transformative deal could unleash pent-up demand for UK stocks and close the valuation gap – maybe BHP’s move on Anglo American is just such a deal. The FTSE 100 rose to a new intraday high of 8,139.92 this morning as European indices were broadly higher on some better news from US tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet. Train, who is one of the City’s best-known stock-pickers, told Financial News this week that investor sentiment about unloved domestic shares could improve if there was a takeover bid for a “substantive UK company”….. Darktrace’s decision to accept the terms of Thoma Bravo’s takeover offer will add yet more fuel to the argument that the London Stock Exchange is in some trouble. Indeed, Darktrace takes a swing at the London market today, saying it hasn’t been properly valued since floating three years ago. Darktrace says: Whilst the Darktrace Board remain confident that Darktrace’s strategy can continue to deliver attractive returns for shareholders and that Darktrace has a strong future as a public company, the Darktrace Board believes that Darktrace’s operating and financial achievements have not been reflected commensurately in its valuation with shares trading at a significant discount to its global peer group. Darktrace floated at 250p per share in April 2021, and swiftly soared to £10 by September 2021 amid excitement about the prospects of its technology, which uses artificial intelligence to create digital security products. But its shares then fell back, after stockbroker Peel Hunt questioned its high valuation and said Darktrace customers had described its technology as “snake oil”. Darktrace then came under attack from short sellers, betting against its share price. Shares in Darktrace have jumped to 620p – matching Thoma Bravo’s takeover offer – which is their highest since November 2021. The FTSE 100 reached yet another record high this morning as investors remain in a positive mood, reports Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: There has been a flurry of strong results from big hitters like Barclays and AstraZeneca on Thursday, which has helped carry the FTSE to these new highs. The market’s also reacting to the news that consumer confidence has improved slightly, according to data from GfK. Anglo American has also rejected BHP’s surprise takeover bid, deeming the multi-billion pound offer as unattractive. The proposed deal would hugely reshape the business, and the Anglo board has suggested the current bid isn’t reflective of the opportunity. There’s every chance BHP will come back to the table, and these conversations will remain the core cause of market reactions for both groups. Newsflash: Another UK company has fallen to a takeover approach. Darktrace, the British artificial intelligence and cybersecurity company, has agreed to be taken over by US private equity firm Thoma Bravo. The recommended all cash acquisition values Darktrace at £4.25bn. Thoma Bravo are paying $7.75 in cash, or 620p, for Darktrace, a 20% premium on last night’s closing share price of 517p. Shares in Darktrace have jumped by 16% to 602p, the top rise on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized firms. Thoma Bravo says the acquisition of Darktrace is “an attractive opportunity to increase its exposure to the large and growing cybersecurity market”, and to invest to accelerate Darktrace’s development. Thoma Bravo had walked away from takeover talks with Darktrace in September 2022 Today, Darktrace says that its board believes its shareholders should be provided with the opportunity to consider Thoma Bravo’s offer. Britain’s blue-chip FTSE 100 share index has hit a new intraday high, for the fourth day running. The Footsie has climbed as high as 8,136 points this morning, up around 0.7%. Yesterday it was pushed by by the surge in Anglo American’s share price, and by Barclays and AstraZeneca after their latest financial results. This morning, NatWest are the top riser, up 4%, after reporting a smaller-than-expected 27% drop in profits in the last quarter. investors are also in a cheery mood, after strong results from Google’s parent company Alphabet, and Microsoft, last night. Shares in Anglo American are basically flat at the start of trading in London. They’re trading at £25.57, (having closed at £25.60 last night), still above BHP’s now-rejected offer of £25.08 each. That suggests that City traders believe this morning’s rebuffing may not be the end of the matter…. Shares in BHP Group fell by 4.6% on the Australian stock market overnight, as investors there digested its approach for Anglo. As well as lowering the value of its all-share offer, this suggests some concerns over the merits of the deal – and expectations that BHP might improve its bid. As Brenton Saunders of investment manager Pendal put it to Reuters. “I am a bit surprised that the deal is not an agreed deal. It likely means BHP will need to offer more to win over shareholders and management and risks creating unhelpful animosity. “The deal is complicated in that Anglo has a complicated structure with a number of moving parts like AngloPlats, Kumba and De Beers. It’s not clear how BHP adds value to the deal if it is required to offer considerably more.” My colleague Nils Pratley explained yesterday why BHP’s offer, although clever, was simply not high enough to succeed…. Anglo would have to demerge its two big South African units that already have separate listings in Johannesburg, Anglo American Platinum and the local iron ore producer Kumba, by distributing the shares to its own shareholders. Then BHP would buy the rest of Anglo via an all-share offer. Add it all up and BHP presented its £31bn proposal as being pitched at a 31% premium for the Anglo assets that don’t have their own listings. In reality, few will look at the numbers that way. BHP’s own description of the “total value” of its proposal as being £25.08 a share (with the listed parts included at £8.26) implied only a 13% premium to Anglo’s closing share price on Wednesday of £22-ish. Indeed, the offer was a bit less than £25 because BHP’s own shares fell slightly. Thus the many Anglo shareholders, including Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM) and Abrdn, who called BHP’s offer “opportunistic” are correct. A £25 offer is clearly too mean. For all its calamitous recent history, Anglo should be able to get back £30 under its own steam via self-improvement. Its shares stood at £36 as recently as January last year. Note, too, that BHP has made its move when the price of diamonds (Anglo owns 85% of De Beers) and platinum are at cyclical lows. One must assume BHP expected such a reaction from the ranks of Anglo shareholders, so its first shot was probably a sighter. It will need to go higher if it wants to continue the pursuit. But, if the target is up for grabs, all sorts of possibilities come into play. There’s nothing to stop Anglo breaking itself up, for example. And, if it were prepared to let go of the prized copper mines on their own, there’d be a queue of potential bidders. BHP couldn’t be surprised by such a development either: if you make a proposal that amounts to “we’d like to buy you, except for the bits we don’t like”, others are free to riff on the idea. More here: Some of Anglo American’s largest shareholders should be pleased by today’s rejection of BHP Group’s offer. Yesterday, Legal &amp; General Investment Management (Anglo’s 11th largest shareholder) criticised BHP Group’s approach was “highly opportunistic” and “unattractive”. Another investor, Redwheel, argued that the details of BHP’s proposal were “sketchy” and “rather opportunistic”, in view of recent weakness in Anglo’s share price. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Miner Anglo American has rebuffed a takeover proposal from its larger rival BHP Group, declaring that the £31.1bn offer is “opportunistic” and “significantly” too low. A day after the mining sector was shaken up by BHP’s approach, Anglo’s board has unanimously rejected the proposal. The company says: The Board has considered the Proposal with its advisers and concluded that the Proposal significantly undervalues Anglo American and its future prospects. It gives several reasons: not only is the offer too low, but Anglo isn’t impressed by the structure of BHP’s all-share proposal, citing uncertainty and complexity, and “significant execution risks”. Under BHP’s plan, Anglo would demerge its entire shareholdings in Anglo American Platinum Limited and Kumba Iron Ore Limited to its shareholders first, before being acquired, as BHP is mainly interested in its copper mines. Announcing the rejection of BHP’s approach, Stuart Chambers, chairman of Anglo American, tells the City: “Anglo American is well positioned to create significant value from its portfolio of high quality assets that are well aligned with the energy transition and other major demand trends. With copper representing 30% of Anglo American’s total production, and with the benefit of well-sequenced and value-accretive growth options in copper and other structurally attractive products, the Board believes that Anglo American’s shareholders stand to benefit from what we expect to be significant value appreciation as the full impact of those trends materialises. Chambers adds that Anglo American is “entirely focused” on delivering its strategic priorities. The company owns mines in countries including Chile, South Africa, Brazil and Australia, but a series of missteps – including disappointing production rates last year – have left it vulnerable to a takeover approach. But some analysts have already suggested that BHP might have to improve its offer, or that other bidders could also enter the fray with their own proposals…. Yesterday, Anglo’s shares surged 16% and closed slightly higher than BHP’s offer (which is worth £25.08 per share). That implies the City expected the initial proposal to be rebuffed. Jamie Maddock, energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: The fact that the shares are trading just above what BHP is offering suggests one of two things – either BHP is going to up its offer or sweeten the deal in some way, or a second offer comes forward from another diversified miner like Glencore. The deal premium feels relatively low, particularly in the context of recent M&amp;A offers and the heightened complexity hence something above £30 per share could be likely to get it done.

        "title": "Anglo American rejects £31bn takeover offer from mining rival BHP",
        "content": "The board of Anglo American, the London-listed mining company, has rejected a “highly unattractive” £31bn takeover approach from its Australian rival BHP. BHP’s all-share proposed offer for Anglo American had the potential to be one of the biggest deals in the global mining sector for a decade but has attracted criticism from Anglo’s shareholders as being too low and “highly opportunistic”. Anglo American said in a statement that its board had unanimously rejected BHP’s approach because it “significantly undervalues” the company and its future prospects. It also added that the structure of BHP’s proposal, which required Anglo American to complete two separate demergers, was “highly unattractive”. Stuart Chambers, the chair of Anglo American, called the BHP proposal “opportunistic” and said the structure of the plans meant that potential risks of the transaction would be borne mainly by Anglo’s investors. Anglo American dashed BHP’s hopes after a volley of criticism from some of the company’s biggest shareholders within hours of the initial proposal on Thursday. The plans were criticised by Anglo investors including Legal &amp; General Investment Management, one of its largest shareholders, and Abrdn as being “highly opportunistic” and “unattractive”. Anglo is likely to face further pressure from its new shareholder, the activist fund Elliott Investment, which has built a roughly $1bn (£800m) stake in the company in recent months. The fund led by Paul Singer is one of Anglo’s top 10 shareholders, according to Bloomberg, which first reported Elliott’s stake. Elliott and Anglo American declined to comment. South Africa’s mining minister, Gwede Mantashe, also signalled he was against the takeover plan. Anglo American’s largest shareholder is the South African state asset manager, the Public Investment Corporation, which holds about 7% of Anglo’s shares, and a significant number of its mines are in South Africa. Anglo American, which has a market value of about £34bn, has long been seen as a takeover target as its share price has lagged behind rivals. Last December, its shares plummeted after it cut its copper production forecasts because of difficulties at its mines in Peru and Chile. Its shares were roughly unchanged in early trading on Friday at £25.60. The proposed BHP offer came as miners race to corner the market for copper, which is in high demand within the clean energy sector. Anglo investors would have received 0.7097 BHP shares for each Anglo share, valuing each Anglo share at £25.08. BHP also said it would undertake a strategic review of Anglo American’s other operations, including its diamond business post completion. A foreign takeover of Anglo American, one of the largest companies on the FTSE 100, would deal a further blow to London’s financial market, hastening the exodus of London-listed companies to other bourses. BHP moved its primary listing from the UK to Australia in 2022, and a takeover of Anglo American would have meant the London Stock Exchange losing one of its 25 largest companies at a time when companies such as Tui are planning to leave London to list elsewhere. Under takeover rules, BHP must make a firm offer for Anglo American by 22 May or walk away.",

        "title": "Cybersecurity firm Darktrace agrees $5.3bn sale to US private equity business",
        "content": "The Cambridge-based cybersecurity and artificial intelligence company Darktrace is likely to become the latest British technology champion to be swallowed up by a US suitor, after it agreed a $5.3bn (£4.2bn) sale to US private equity business Thoma Bravo. Darktrace, whose co-founding investor Mike Lynch is now on trial for fraud and conspiracy in the US, agreed to an offer 44% higher than its average share price over the past three months. Announcing the deal, the company fired a Parthian shot at the under-pressure London stock market, saying its technology, described as “cutting edge” by Thoma Bravo, had been undervalued. In a statement to investors, the Darktrace board said that its “operating and financial achievements have not been reflected commensurately in its valuation, with shares trading at a significant discount to its global peer group”. The comment will fuel fears that the FTSE is haemorrhaging prestigious company listings to the US, in search of greater fundraising potential. Recent departures include the chipmaker Arm Holdings, the gambling company Flutter and the building materials business CRH. Shell has hinted it could leave the London stock market, while the miner Anglo American on Friday rejected an offer from the Australia-listed rival BHP but could yet succumb to a higher offer. Darktrace said the offer from Thoma Bravo would give its shareholders certainty about the value of their shares and enable the company to grow in a “stable and private” setting. Thoma Bravo, which walked away from previous takeover talks in 2022, made a cash offer that values Darktrace at $7.75 a share, or about 620p, compared with its valuation of 250p when it floated in London in 2021. Despite its widely admired cybersecurity technology, which uses AI to detect and kill threats within IT networks, analysts have said that Darktrace’s valuation has lagged behind its peers. The company has struggled to shake off lingering concerns linked to its founding co-investor, the British tech entrepreneur Lynch, who has no formal role within the company but owns 6.8% with his wife, Angela Bacares. Between them, the couple will make just under £300m from the sale of their shares. That could help fund Lynch’s legal bills, as he fights allegations that he was the “driving force” behind a massive fraud that led the US tech firm Hewlett-Packard to overpay significantly, when it bought Lynch’s business, Autonomy, for $11.1bn in 2011. HP wrote down the value of its acquisition by $8.8bn less than a year later, alleging serious accounting irregularities on the part of Lynch and several senior colleagues. Lynch has pleaded not guilty, having always denied allegations of wrongdoing. Darktrace’s chief executive, Poppy Gustafsson, was seen as a protege of Lynch but has stressed the company’s distance from its co-founding investor during his fight against extradition and the ongoing trial. In a statement on Friday, she said: “From our base in Cambridge, we are building a world-leading company using a unique form of artificial intelligence to address the societal challenge of cybersecurity. “This proposed offer represents the next stage in our growth journey and I am excited by the many opportunities we have ahead of us. Our technology has never been more relevant in a world increasingly threatened by AI-powered cyber-attacks. “In the face of this, we are expanding our product portfolio, entering new markets, and focused on delivering for our customers, partners and colleagues.” Thoma Bravo, based in Chicago, is one of the world’s largest software and cybersecurity investors, with more than $138bn of assets under management as of the end of 2023. The Thoma Bravo partner Andrew Almeida said: “Darktrace is at the very cutting edge of cybersecurity technology, and we have long been admirers of its platform and capability in artificial intelligence. The pace of innovation in cybersecurity is accelerating in response to cyber threats that are simultaneously complex, global and sophisticated.”",

        "title": "Tesla among electric carmakers forced to cut prices as market stalls",
        "content": "Elon Musk became the world’s richest man by evangelising about electric cars – and delivering them by the million. Yet in recent months his company, Tesla, has struggled to maintain its momentum: sales have dropped this year, and so has its share price. Those struggles have become emblematic of a broader reckoning facing the electric vehicle (EV) industry. After the soaring demand and valuations of the coronavirus pandemic years, the pace of sales growth has slowed. The industry has entered a new phase, with questions over whether the switch from petrol and diesel to cleaner electric is facing a troublesome stall or a temporary speed bump. Musk acknowledged the difficulties this week, telling investors: “The EV adoption rate globally is under pressure, and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.” Musk, of course, insisted that was the wrong decision. The sales slowdown is real, however. Tesla and its nearest rival in electric car volumes, China’s BYD, have both reported lower electric car sales. Across Europe, battery electric cars slipped to a 13% share of all sales, down from last year’s 13.9%, while sales of hybrids – which combine a battery with an internal combustion engine – rose to 29% from 24.4%. In the UK, electric cars accounted for 15.5% of total car sales in the first three months of 2024, only marginally up from the same time last year. In recent years electric car manufacturers have been able easily to sell every electric car they have made. Yet now, businesses across much of the world are struggling with the end of the era of rock-bottom interest rates, which has left less money in household pockets. “The economic headwinds are quite ugly in general, so it doesn’t surprise me that we’re having a slowdown,” said Ian Henry, whose AutoAnalysis consultancy works with several carmakers. Buyers must still pay more upfront for battery cars (although most would save money by owning an electric vehicle because of cheaper energy). And electric car repair costs and insurance costs can be higher in some places because of a shortage of mechanics. Another important factor is the very patchy introduction of public electric chargers, which is giving some potential buyers cause to pause. All of that has been leapt upon by sceptics of the EV industry – and made them a battleground in the culture wars. The hand of government Rico Luman, a senior sector economist covering automotive at ING, an investment bank, said that EV sales had hit a “plateau”, and that it would get harder to sell electric cars after the initial rush of early adopters comfortable with switching from petrol and diesel. However, there is more going on with the showdown than purely economic factors. Governments are also a playing a major role. That is particularly evident across Europe, where EV sales are taking diverging paths even though buyers face similar pressures. Norway is an outlier. With heavily subsidised electric car sales, EVs now make up 90% of the market. The EV market share has also increased this year in Denmark, Belgium and France. However, it has declined in Germany, once the biggest electric car market, for one simple reason: the government has withdrawn subsidies. As well as affecting demand, regulation is also playing a big role in what cars are on offer. Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based electric cars analyst, has long expected European electric sales growth to slump during 2024. That is because 1 January 2025 is the date on which the EU takes its next big step towards zero-emissions vehicles: the average carbon dioxide emissions of cars sold by each manufacturer must fall by 15% compared with 2021. The rules therefore provide a major incentive for carmakers to focus their electric car efforts on next year. Schmidt argues that the European industry is going through a “replication” of the situation experienced in 2019, when manufacturers held back their electric cars, before launching a barrage of new models in 2020. Sure enough, carmakers are releasing new mass-market models just in time. Renault’s electric 5 hatchback will cost less than €25,000 (£21,430) when sales begin this autumn, while Ford is due to launch an electric version of the UK’s bestselling car, the Ford Puma, later this year. Moaning manufacturers Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot Fiat and Chrysler brands, is also joining the rush: it unveiled its electric Vauxhall/Opel Grandland SUV on Tuesday. But that has not stopped its chief executive, Carlos Tavares, from complaining bitterly about how regulations are enforcing the pace of the switch to electric. This week he harangued the UK’s transport minister, Mark Harper, over the government’s zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which will force carmakers to sell an increasing proportion of electric cars. He then claimed to journalists that the mandate was a “terrible” policy because it was forcing carmakers to introduce electric models too quickly. He said: “The consequence of this is that everybody will start pushing the BEV [battery electric vehicle], pushing the metal into the market, which then totally destroys profitability, which then destroys the companies.” Schmidt said carmakers’ complaints may have an ulterior motive. The EU rules will ban most internal combustion sales by 2035, but they are due for review in 2026. “Lots of manufacturers complaining now that it’s unrealistic to meet those targets is a lobbying message by stealth,” Schmidt said. “They’ve done it so often it’s almost a case of the boy that cried wolf. There’s definitely a hidden agenda in their moaning.” But other manufacturers have already slowed their shift, which will mean selling petrol models – which are still more profitable – for longer. In the US, General Motors last year delayed production from a factory in Michigan, while Ford postponed construction of a plant in Kentucky. And in the UK, the luxury carmaker Bentley last month said it would delay its first battery car for a year to 2026. “Manufacturers are definitely struggling at the moment strategically,” said Luman. “They’re now playing around with the timing of models, but not postponing it too far. Otherwise they’ll miss the boat in terms of market share.” Perhaps the biggest reason European and US carmakers are unlikely to reverse course on EVs is China. Growth in Chinese sales may have slowed in the first quarter of 2024 compared with last year, but they still topped a million, according to industry data cited by Reuters. A host of Chinese carmakers – including the leader BYD and new, well-funded entrants such as phone maker Xiaomi – are battling to dominate their home market and win a new role as the world’s biggest car exporter. The German chancelllor, Olaf Scholz, on his recent trip to China, argued against protectionism and said Chinese manufacturers must still have access to the European market – acutely aware that penalising Chinese EVs would meet swift retaliation against Germany’s carmakers. For electric carmakers, the huge competition is biting – forcing even Tesla to cut prices to keep selling its cars. That competition will cause car executives sleepless nights – and could force some to merge or face bankruptcy, which could cause job losses. But it could also push prices down further, making electric cars cheaper than petrol equivalents. “It’s potentially a good thing for consumers,” said Ian Henry. “Whether it’s a good thing for manufacturers who are trying to make money is a different question.”",

        "title": "Barclays accused of greenwashing over financing for Italian oil company ",
        "content": "Barclays is being accused by environmental groups of greenwashing after helping to arrange €4bn (£3.4bn) in financing for the Italian oil company Eni in a way that allows them to qualify towards its $1tn sustainable financing goal. Environmental groups have said the London-based bank is deliberately misleading the public by labelling the financial instruments as “sustainable” at the same time that Eni is in the midst of a multibillion-pound fossil fuel expansion drive designed to increase production. An investigation by the journalism organisation Point Source has revealed that the deals for a revolving credit line were completed last year, months after the Milan-based company announced it intended to increase its spending on the production of oil and gas by at least a third over four years, investing between €24bn and €26bn. In February 2023, Eni said it was aiming to increase its production of oil and gas by between 12.6% and 17% over the four-year period to the end of 2026. Eni’s oil and gas expansion plans include a project to develop the Verus gas field, which could emit 7.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year and has been described as a “carbon bomb” by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Owing to its expansion plans, Eni’s production in 2030 is projected to be 35% higher than that required to align with the International Energy Agency’s net zero emissions by 2050 scenario, according to the campaign group Reclaim Finance. Eni says it still aims to achieve net zero by 2050. The financing Barclays helped Eni raise includes a sustainability-linked bond (SLB) worth €1bn and a revolving sustainability-linked loan (SLL) worth €3bn. While there is nothing in the terms of these financial instruments to prevent Eni from using the funds raised to develop oil and gas projects, including the Verus gas field, Barclays says the financing qualifies to be counted towards its 2030 sustainability target because the interest rates have been linked to emissions goals. However, environmental groups and financial experts say the goals in the contracts, which exclude scope 3 emissions, are unambitious and incompatible with the internationally agreed target to limit any rise in global temperature to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Scope 1 emissions come from sources that an organisation owns or controls directly, while scope 2 emissions are caused indirectly and come from where the energy it uses is produced. Scope 3 emissions include all other indirect sources in the value chain of an organisation that are not within scope 1 and 2. The exclusion of scope 3 emissions in the targets has been criticised because the majority of Eni’s emissions, such as those from burning the oil and gas it produces, are considered scope 3. Jo Richardson, the head of research at the non-profit research organisation Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute, said: “There are a lot of sustainability-linked financial products that are not effective – and these are two classic examples. “To see a really effective sustainability structure in the oil and gas sector you would need to see a company with a clear and committed plan to reducing scope 3 emissions.” Lucie Pinson, the founder and director of Reclaim Finance, said: “Issuing an SLL like this is an easy way for Eni to raise money without having to make a significant climate effort or change anything about its business. It also allows banks who have pledged net zero to keep financing the worst climate offenders while pretending to support their transition.” In June last year, the Financial Conduct Authority sent a letter to financial institutions warning of “the possibility of potential risks to market integrity and suspicion of greenwashing in the context of SLLs”. It said it was concerned about “weak incentives, potential conflicts of interest, and suggestions of low ambition and poor design”. In February this year, Barclays announced that it would no longer provide direct funding for new oil and gas projects. However, financing in the form of SLBs and SLLs could continue for companies that are developing new oil and gas fields because the bank does not consider this to be “direct” project financing. Huw Davies, senior finance adviser at the campaign group Make My Money Matter, said: “Not only are the UK’s largest banks [continuing to help] finance companies that are expanding oil and gas production, but this shows they’re doing so under the pretence of so-called ‘sustainable’ finance. “Barclays’ decision to provide billions in corporate finance to Eni – a company which continues to develop new oil and gas – is enabling fossil fuel expansion, and contradicting their claims to be serious about sustainability.” When contacted by the Guardian, Barclays declined to comment. In a statement, Eni said it chose the targets in its sustainability-linked financial instruments “tailored to their maturity range” and because of this “it was not possible to use a scope 3 target”. It added: “Eni has built a business model that puts sustainability at the centre of every business activity, including financial strategy. “The development of the Verus project is consistent with Eni’s objective of achieving scope 1 and 2 carbon neutrality in all its businesses by 2035 … In particular, the development of Verus would include the use of capture and storage of CO2 to supply decarbonised energy in line with Eni’s objectives.” Barclays was a lead arranger in the $3bn sustainability-linked revolving credit facility that was provided to Eni by 26 global financial institutions including Italy-based Mediobanca Group, New York-based Citi, and France’s Natixis. The SLL has a time period of five years and its sustainability targets relate to the installed capacity for the production of electricity from renewable sources as well as emissions goals. Barclays was one of three banks that structured the $1bn SLB for Eni. The other banks involved were Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase. All banks declined to comment.",

        "title": "UK consumers feeling more confident about finances, says NatWest boss",
        "content": "Consumer confidence is bouncing back in the UK, with people predicting a brighter financial future for the first time in two years, NatWest has said. Paul Thwaite, the bank’s chief executive, said easing price pressures as inflation comes down seemed to be feeding through to the general public. Headline consumer price inflation is still above the Bank of England’s 2% target at 3.2% but has fallen sharply from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022. Natwest’s own economic forecast suggests inflation will fall to 2.5% by the end of this year. “With inflation continuing to fall, and the Bank of England expected to start cutting rates later in the year, people and families are feeling more confident about their financial situation,” Thwaite said on Friday morning. “And for the first time since August 2021, more consumers expect their position to be better in 12 months’ time.” That was based on internal and external surveys monitored by banking bosses, he added. Thwaite said there was still “uncertainty” over the UK’s economic trajectory. However, in the absence of particularly dismal forecasts, the banking group was able to signal further confidence that most customers would be able to repay their loans on time. NatWest said it had put aside £93m to protect itself from potential defaults by borrowers in the first quarter. That compares with £70m during the same period in 2022 but is far lower than the £191m analysts had predicted. “Of course, there are many different views, and the actual trajectory may be different, especially given the considerable macro uncertainty in the UK and overseas. Despite this, customers remain resilient and impairments are low,” Thwaite said. Lower-than-predicted loan loss forecasts, as well as a surprise rise in net interest margins – which measure the difference between what is charged for loans versus paid out to savers – to 2.05%, boosted NatWest shares. Shares were up 4.6% on Friday to a 14-month high of 303p a share. It made NatWest the top riser on the FTSE 100, and helped boost the blue chip index to a new all-time high of 8,136.52 points in early trading. That was despite a 27% drop in pre-tax profits to £1.3bn in the three months to March. However, it had a tough act to follow, having reported a 50% jump in profits to £1.8bn during the same period last year, after a string of interest rate increases by the Bank of England. Since then, Thwaite said NatWest has been paying higher interest rates to many savers, as well as tough competition for mortgage borrowers, just as the housing market slowed. “To me, it very much reflects the fact some of the annualised impacts of the changes in customer behaviour that we saw in 2023: customers moving from instant access accounts to fixed-term deposits, especially as the pace of interest rises increased during quarter two and quarter three. It also reflects a very shallow but competitive mortgage market last year.” NatWest also confirmed that the taxpayer’s stake in the bank – which dates back to the £46bn bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland during 2008 financial crisis – had fallen again, to 27.9% from 28.9%, after the government sold another tranche of shares ahead of Friday’s results. The government is preparing to sell a significant portion of its stake to the general public this summer in the hope of fully exiting its stake by 2025-26. Thwaite was formally appointed chief executive in February, having replaced Alison Rose on an interim basis in July after she was forced to quit amid a de-banking row with Nigel Farage. Thwaite previously led NatWest’s business banking division.",

        "title": "Poverty experts tell Labor jobseeker payments should be lifted to 90% of age pension",
        "content": "Jobseeker payments should be raised to 90% of the age pension and indexed to prevent people going “without life’s essentials”, the government’s poverty experts say. The Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee released its pre-budget report on Friday, warning that jobseeker and other working-age payments were still “too low” despite last year’s $40 increase in the base rate. The Australian Council of Social Services seized on the report, arguing that raising jobseeker to 90% of the pension rate ($72 a day) would ensure “people can live with dignity”. The Albanese government has promised further cost-of-living relief in the budget, beyond its revamp of the stage three tax cuts, but has played down expectations of changes to welfare. The EIAC report found that increasing the jobseeker base rate reduced the gap with the age pension “from around $362 per fortnight to $339 per fortnight, a reduction of 6.4%”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But “people receiving [jobseeker] payments told the committee that they regularly go without life’s essentials because they simply cannot afford them,” it said. The government should at least “commit to a timeframe for the full increases of jobseeker and related payments to be implemented, if increases are to be staged”, it said. The inadequacy of jobseeker was “in part the result of unsatisfactory indexation arrangements over many years”, as the benefit is increased in line with inflation. “Without change to indexation arrangements, the living standards of recipients of these payments will continue to fall,” it said, suggesting indexation could be improved by considering how jobseeker compares with wage growth. The EIAC also called for an increase in commonwealth rent assistance, finding that indexation had “not kept pace with the spiralling cost of rents, especially in a housing market with a declining proportion of social housing”. The report called for comprehensive employment services reform, including a full redesign of mutual obligations and an “urgent need to remove automated payments suspensions”. It found the current system was “not fit for purpose and is causing harm”. The EIAC called to abolish the activity test for the childcare subsidy to guarantee all children access to a minimum three days of high quality early childhood education and care, echoing calls from the women’s economic equality taskforce. Earlier in April Guardian Australia exclusively revealed the government will lift early childhood educators’ wages as part of the May budget, but it is unclear whether it will agree to requests to remove the activity test. In January, the government announced changes to stage-three, doubling income tax relief for median income earners and guaranteeing that taxpayers earning less than $45,000, who were due to miss out, would receive a tax cut. Crossbench senators and the social services sector argued the changes did nothing for those earning below the tax-free threshold of $18,200 or most recipients of government payments. On 22 April, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said there will be cost of living relief in the budget but “the centrepiece of that, overwhelmingly the biggest part of that, will be a tax cut for every taxpayer to help with the cost of living”. “But we are considering additional help on top of that and if we can afford that, if it’s affordable, if it’s responsible, if it’s meaningful and it takes some of the edge off inflation rather than add to the inflation problem, then that is attractive to us,” he told reporters in Canberra. The EIAC found that “any negative effect on incentives to work due to an increase in the jobseeker payment is likely to be small”. “For people facing economic exclusion, some literature suggests that higher income support payments may improve the capacity to search for and accept employment.” Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said more than one million people on jobseeker and related payment are “barely surviving on deeply inadequate income support”. “People receiving these payments are eating one meal a day, skipping essential medication and foregoing cooling or heating in a desperate bid to keep a roof over their heads,” she said. Independent senator David Pocock said the EIAC report shows that “we have a social safety net that is not keeping people safe”. “The government talks a lot about not leaving anyone behind – this report … gives them a blueprint to achieve this,” he said.",

Improvements to Snap’s advertising system are delivering results faster than anticipated, the company said. Daily active users of Snapchat grew to 422 million in the first three months of the year, beating analyst expectations of 419.6 million. Revenue during the first quarter meanwhile rose 21% to $1.2bn, beating the analyst consensus estimate of $1.12bn. Snap, based in Santa Monica, California, has long struggled to compete for advertising dollars against larger rivals like Meta Platforms, owner of Facebook and Instagram. But it has been working over the past year to improve how it targets ads to users and simplify the way people interact with the ads. In a letter to shareholders, Snap said its business was improving faster than it expected due to the upgrades and higher demand for features that help brands drive sales or website clicks. “The value we provide our community and advertising partners has translated into improved financial performance,” said Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap. “Our large, growing and hard-to-reach community, brand-safe environment, and full-funnel advertising solutions have made us an increasingly important partner for businesses of all sizes.” On Tuesday, the US Senate passed a bill that gives Chinese tech company ByteDance up to one year to divest its wildly popular video app TikTok – another of Snap’s rivals – or else the app will be banned in the US. Snap said it expects second-quarter revenue of between $1.23bn and $1.26bn, slightly above analysts’ forecasts. The firm expects to its user base to grow to 431m. Reuters contributed reporting",

Jody Ford, the chief executive of the travel company, echoed Haigh’s words, saying rail had “significant power and potential” to drive economic growth into all parts of the country’s communities. Haigh said: “Our railways are critical to making our country a better, wealthier and happier place. We can only achieve our five national missions if we unlock the trapped potential of our railways to boost growth, and opportunity and to connect all of us with each other, with work and with pleasure.” Haigh said a Labour government would establish Great British Railways, which she described as a “single directing mind to control our railways in the passenger interest”. She joked she was not allowed to call the nationalised railway “Rail Britannia” and would not rule out an endorsement of her plan from the Conservative former transport secretary Grant Shapps. Asked why Labour could not guarantee cheaper and more affordable train tickets under their plans, Haigh said it was Labour’s “ambition” to make fares cheaper but “simplification is our first priority” via the party’s best fare guarantee scheme. Keir Starmer vowed to bring an end to the “Tory boom and bust” cycle for the rail industry, after visiting Hitachi’s rail manufacturing plant in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, where 700 jobs are at risk, and a further 1,400 jobs at risk across its supply chain. The rail minister, Huw Merriman, has been accused of dismissing the job losses as “natural peaks and troughs”. Starmer said: “The workforce here at Hitachi is staring down the barrel of job losses. This was not inevitable.” “After 14 years of chaos and uncertainty, [this Tory government] has left our rail manufacturing sector teetering on the brink,” he added. Haigh accepted that the plan would take time, as the final private operator contract with a core term was not due to expire until 2029. “We’d expect all contracts to be brought under Great British Railways by that time,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It will take time; there’s no overnight fixes to a very complex system. We’re not starry eyed about this.” But a Labour government would immediately be able to create a “shadow Great British Railways [organisation] to fire the starting gun on reform” and ensure the party did not lose time or momentum. It would bring together key players including Network Rail and the Rail Delivery Group, before primary legislation was passed to formally establish GBR as an arm’s length body. “The Conservative party has achieved the worst of all worlds for our railways, partially privatised, overly centralised, expensive, but unreliable, confusing and shamefully unaccountable,” Haigh said. She quoted Shapps, who once said: “Unlike most privatisations, that of the railways has never become publicly accepted, because its failings have remained all too obvious … The fragmentation of the network has made it more confusing for passengers, and more difficult and expensive to perform the essentially collaborative task of running trains on time.” Haigh also vowed to see the “workforce as an asset rather than a liability” but she refused to commit to a pay increase because she had “not seen the books” and “wouldn’t do that in an unfunded way”. But she vowed to meet the unions on day one in order to solve the strikes that she said were costing £25m a day.",

        "title": "What is Labour’s plan for rail travel and will it make tickets cheaper?",
        "content": "Labour has made one of its most radical proposals yet in the run-up to an election campaign: to fully nationalise the train network within five years of coming to power. The party has pledged to guarantee the cheapest fares as part of “the biggest reform of our railways for a generation”, bringing all passenger rail into national ownership under the Great British Railways (GBR) body. So, how difficult would the plan be to enact and what does it mean for passengers? How would Labour’s plan for Great British Railways change the way the trains are run? The headline change is nationalisation: the ambition that all passenger train operations, at least, should return to public ownership. But the wider aim is that control of trains and tracks – “wheels and steel”, as some put it – is brought back under one unified structure, at arm’s length from the government. The actual railway infrastructure is already managed by the state-owned Network Rail, since the disastrous tenure of Railtrack in the early days of privatisation, and train operations in Scotland, Wales and a large chunk of England are in public ownership. So a fully renationalised railway (bar the rolling stock and freight) is not as big a step as it may once have sounded – and arguably the pragmatic extension of the plans drawn up by the Conservatives in 2021, to end the fragmentation and waste in the system. How long will the changes take? Labour said it would get the ball rolling on day one. Given the years it has taken for the Conservatives’ GBR plans to crystallise into a draft bill that has scant chance of passing before an election, supporters of the changes would be forgiven for not holding their breath for legislation. But some of the spadework has been done by the GBR transition team, and Labour will be hoping for a more stable tenancy in Downing Street to see the policy through. It is, it stresses, a long-term plan. As far as nationalisation of the train operators goes, most of the contracts of remaining operators will expire naturally within the next term, while the government can exercise break clauses in others, such as Avanti West Coast and Cross Country. What would the trains look like? Eventually, they would all be GBR-branded trains rather than the individual liveries and logos of different operators. Labour hopes that this will make things simpler for passengers, avoiding confusion over ticketing, as well as cutting costs. Would it make train travel cheaper? Possibly, but not for a while yet. Labour says it wants to make the railway more affordable but has definitively avoided any pledges to cut or even freeze the overall level of fares. However, it believes that its plans will eventually save £2.2bn a year by avoiding the duplication and bureaucracy brought on by the current system, where the Department for Transport tightly controls and specifies contracts for the private firms, and reams of staff are employed in back-end roles. That could give ministers some scope to use more of the billions in annual taxpayer subsidy to bring fares down long-term. What about this best-price guarantee? Make that an “ambition”, according to the policy document. It’s testament to the complexity, or occasional absurdity, of UK rail fares that even after years of industry focus on improving the system, renationalising looks an easier promise than telling a passenger they’ve paid the right amount. Things can be improved, Labour says, as contactless tap-in and tap-out payments extend through more and more of the country, opening up the possibility of a Transport for London-style system, where fares are streamlined and automatically capped or refunded. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, pointedly chose the headquarters of Trainline in central London to launch her plans on Thursday, paying tribute to the travel app firm’s “relentless focus on passengers [and] improving their experience”. Trainline shares fell 10%, even though Labour says it has no plans to replace the private firm with a single state retailer. But given that the app’s business depends on people paying extra to cut through the railway’s confusing fares, fragmentation and lack of a decent central ticketing site, Trainline shareholder nerves might be taken as a vote of confidence that GBR will improve the industry’s own offering. How else might passengers benefit? Labour says it would leave the running of the railway to the experts – but the transport secretary would set strategy and take on the role of passenger-in-chief, and the industry would not be “marking its own homework”. The plan aims to strengthen the voice of passengers by rolling together the various bodies currently meant to be standing up for them – the watchdog Transport Focus and the little-known Rail Ombudsman, as well as a few divisions of the Office of Rail and Road. What will happen to the private operators? Their representatives at Rail Partners warn that it will be “messy” and the railway will lose their expertise. But the people actually running train operators, right up to the managing directors, have typically stayed in post with a different coloured badge when the owning groups moved on, and passengers at say, Southeastern or LNER may not feel life is very different. Firms once regarded as pillars of privatised rail such as Stagecoach, National Express (now Mobico) and Virgin have long exited UK rail already, pursuing business elsewhere.",

        "title": "BHP’s takeover bid for Anglo American is clever but far too low | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "In theory, Anglo American has been a sitting duck for a takeover bid for about a decade. Its share price has lagged behind that of other big miners and successive efforts to sharpen a sprawling portfolio have underwhelmed. The last news, at the end of 2023, was production delays that sent the shares down 20% in a day. In practice, the same complexities, plus deep entanglement in South African politics, have served as a deterrent to a bid. Anglo was seen as too fiddly. But here comes BHP, the Australian giant of the sector, with a proposal to cut through the noise and get to the assets it would like to own, primarily Anglo’s copper mines in Peru and Chile and, to a lesser extent, its iron ore projects in Brazil and metallurgical coal in Queensland. The takeover idea is certainly clever. Anglo would have to demerge its two big South African units that already have separate listings in Johannesburg, Anglo American Platinum and the local iron ore producer Kumba, by distributing the shares to its own shareholders. Then BHP would buy the rest of Anglo via an all-share offer. Add it all up and BHP presented its £31bn proposal as being pitched at a 31% premium for the Anglo assets that don’t have their own listings. In reality, few will look at the numbers that way. BHP’s own description of the “total value” of its proposal as being £25.08 a share (with the listed parts included at £8.26) implied only a 13% premium to Anglo’s closing share price on Wednesday of £22-ish. Indeed, the offer was a bit less than £25 because BHP’s own shares fell slightly. Thus the many Anglo shareholders, including Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM) and Abrdn, who called BHP’s offer “opportunistic” are correct. A £25 offer is clearly too mean. For all its calamitous recent history, Anglo should be able to get back £30 under its own steam via self-improvement. Its shares stood at £36 as recently as January last year. Note, too, that BHP has made its move when the price of diamonds (Anglo owns 85% of De Beers) and platinum are at cyclical lows. One must assume BHP expected such a reaction from the ranks of Anglo shareholders, so its first shot was probably a sighter. It will need to go higher if it wants to continue the pursuit. But, if the target is up for grabs, all sorts of possibilities come into play. There’s nothing to stop Anglo breaking itself up, for example. And, if it were prepared to let go of the prized copper mines on their own, there’d be a queue of potential bidders. BHP couldn’t be surprised by such a development either: if you make a proposal that amounts to “we’d like to buy you, except for the bits we don’t like”, others are free to riff on the idea. The other consideration here is the non-financial one: would a BHP purchase of two-thirds of Anglo be desirable for the rest of us? That is really a copper question since the metal is critical to electrification, and thus to the transition of the world’s energy system towards lower-carbon generation. “The [mining] industry is extremely concentrated today, and further consolidating it will not contribute to accelerating investment in the way we believe is needed,” said LGIM. Again, that’s a fair point. BHP is currently number three in copper globally and would become number one with the addition of Anglo’s mines. A global market share of 10%-ish may not sound enormous, but a BHP-Anglo deal would probably spark consolidation elsewhere. In the end, you get fewer but larger miners – especially of the type that are western-facing and can be vaguely held to account by virtue of having a stock market listing. That competition question, though, is the one after the current one. On the first day of a takeover tale that probably has a long way to run, the jump in Anglo’s share price to £25.60 told the story: BHP needs to improve its offer.",

        "title": "Tata Steel rejects union plan to save jobs and keep Port Talbot furnace open",
        "content": "Tata Steel has rejected a plan by unions to keep open a blast furnace at the Port Talbot steelworks, ending any hopes of avoiding as many as 2,800 job losses. Unions met the company in London on Thursday with another plea not to press ahead with its proposals, which will likely end the ability to make steel from iron ore in south Wales by September and cause thousands of job losses. The first blast furnace is due to close at the end of June, followed by the second blast furnace and the “heavy end”, which makes steel from iron, in September. Tata Steel said it would open a voluntary redundancy scheme on 15 May. Indian-owned Tata Steel announced the closure of two of the UK’s four active blast furnaces in January, in a major blow to Port Talbot. The town and its economy are dominated by the steelworks. Tata plans to replace the two blast furnaces – which produce molten iron from iron ore – with electric arc furnaces. Tata on Thursday said it planned to place orders for the furnace equipment by September, and begin construction by August 2025. Electrification is a much greener option as it does not rely on a chemical reaction that creates carbon dioxide. It will also represent a significant £1.25bn investment in the site. However, the newer technology will require many fewer workers. The shift to new furnaces – which could cut UK emissions by about 2% if renewable electricity is used – is to be supported by about £500m in government subsidies. The union plan would have kept a blast furnace in operation while building an electric arc furnace, saving jobs. The Tata Steel chief executive, TV Narendran, said: “Having looked carefully at all the options over the past seven months in consultation with union representatives, we have decided to proceed with our proposed restructuring and transition. This is the most viable proposal, in contrast to the unions’ unaffordable plan, which has high inherent operational and safety risk.” Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community union, said Tata’s decision was a “destructive bad deal for steel” but added that “this isn’t over” as the union awaits a member vote on strike action. “We do not accept the company’s assertion our plan was too expensive,” Rickhuss said. “In fact, it would have returned the company to profits, and the additional capital expenditure needed to make it a reality could have been funded by an additional £450m from the government – a drop in the water compared to what other European countries are investing in their domestic steel industries.” The UK’s two other blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, run by the Chinese-owned British Steel, are also due to close. That will leave the UK without the ability to make primary steel from iron ore, as electric arc furnaces will instead rely on scrap metal. The confirmation of Tata’s decision will bring the prospect of industrial action closer. Community, the union representing the most steelworkers, called for members to back its ballot to allow it to call a strike. Community and GMB, which also represents steelworkers, will close their ballots on 9 May. Unite, another union, has been pushing for an even more ambitious plan for the UK steel industry that would include a subsidy for energy prices and ensure that no jobs are lost. That plan, which would rely on support from the government, has also been rejected by Tata. Unite’s steelworkers have already voted in favour of industrial action. The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “Tata is an immensely profitable company using our outgoing government’s inadequacies to make easy money and boost its other operations at the expense of UK jobs and the national interest.” Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, home of the Port Talbot steelworks, said the closure “will have a devastating impact on our local community as it will mean exporting well-paid jobs from Port Talbot to India, despite the country’s steel plants having a far higher carbon footprint”. Tata is the country’s largest steel producer, employing about 8,000 staff in the UK, with about half based at Port Talbot.",

        "content": "Shoppers are beginning to spend more freely but it will take a cut in interest rates before sales of more expensive items such as TVs and sofas start to take off again, the boss of Sainsbury’s has said. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of the group, which owns Argos and Habitat as well as its supermarkets, said he was cautious about the outlook for general merchandise, with sales of furniture and homeware remaining weak as households faced high mortgage and loan costs. “There is more evidence that customers are starting to trade up a bit and that’s really going to build,” he said as inflation on food had eased. “They are not always trading down [to cheaper food products].” However, there had not been a marked shift on “big ticket” non-food items, Roberts said. “On general merchandise customers are more cautious. It is going to take a change in interest rates later in the year, let’s hope, for the environment on discretionary spend begin to change.” Roberts said Sainsbury’s was “happy with momentum” and selling more goods and winning share from Aldi and Lidl as well as Waitrose. He said as shoppers returned to working in the office they were shopping less online. “More and more want to go to a supermarket where they have full choice,” he added. Roberts said the Sainsbury’s group hoped for a revival in sales of barbecues and clothes if there was a “more normal summer” after last year’s wet and cold weather. However, sales of clothing, toys and homeware are under pressure as shoppers continue to battle high household costs. Sainsbury’s said it had also had delivery hold-ups caused by disruption to commercial shipping in the Red Sea and had got some fashion choices wrong. This led to an 11.4% fall in sales of clothing in the last three months of its financial year. Sales at Argos fell 6.6%, while grocery sales rose 7.3%, partly helped by inflation. Roberts said he expected food price inflation to continue at less than 5% into next year as wage rises slowed, the cost of many commodities fell and energy and transport costs became more stable. He said supplies of UK-grown crops such as potatoes and onions were also under pressure from the “extreme amount of rain” over the winter and spring. Sainsbury’s spent £220m in keeping prices down over the past year and in February it said it would use technology including automated tills, warehouse robots and AI-forecasting tools to ensure it has the right stock in stores to help cut £1bn of costs over the next three years. As part of up to £850m in annual investment for the next three years, Sainsbury’s is also rejigging 180 of its supermarkets to make more space for food, especially fresh produce, while shifting out products also sold in its Argos outlets such as electrical gadgets. Concerns about the outlook and the weak non-food performance overshadowed a better-than-expected 1.6% rise in underlying pre-tax profits to £701m in the year to 2 March, as sales rose 3.6% to £36.3bn. One-off costs from restructuring of the Sainsbury’s banking business meant statutory pre-tax profits fell 15.3% to £277m. Sainsbury’s share price fell about 4% to 257p after the update. Russ Mould at AJ Bell said it didn’t hit the right note with investors. “Underlying profit growth of 1.6% is pedestrian and a lack of dividend growth hardly signals a business going places. While [Sainsbury’s has] done well by focusing on food and broadening its appeal with more value-led products, clothing sales remain miserable and Argos’s performance is nothing to write home about,” he said.",

A total of 2,520 of the “debentures” are on sale, offering a reserved seat for each of the 14 days of the tournament for five years from 2026-30. Applications to buy the exclusive seats – positioned on the same level as the royal box – close at midday on Friday. Back in the UK, BP’s annual shareholder meeting was marred by protest which led to the arrest of four climate campaigners outside the event in Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey. The oil giant’s investors were accused by Fossil Free London of having “blood on [their] hands” after “profiting from the ongoing genocide in Gaza and climate breakdown”. Joanna Warrington, a spokesperson for the group, which organised the disruption, said: “Shareholders should be hiding their bloody hands in shame today, not lifting them to vote for more ecocide and genocide.” Warrington said all attendees of the event faced “intense security”, led by around 60 security staff and police officers, which included obscuring phone cameras with stickers and placing phones in sealed bags. BP faced similar scenes at its AGM last year. A BP spokesperson said: “Our priority continues to be the safety and security of all attendees.” The company added that it had “received overwhelming support” for the board’s resolutions from its shareholders, which reflects “the strong level of confidence they have in our strategy”. The AGM was BP’s first since the board sacked former chief executive Bernard Looney over relationships with his colleagues last year. He has been replaced by former chief financial officer Murray Auchincloss. As feared, Meta’s shares have slumped in early trading as investors show their unhappiness about Mark Zuckerberg’ AI spending spree. Shares in Facebook’s parent company have dropped by over 15% to $418.28. That knocks around $190bn off the company’s valuation, bringing it down from $1.25 trillion to $1.06 trillion. The US economy performed below expectations in the first quarter, says Nathaniel Casey, investment strategist at wealth management firm Evelyn Partners, with today’s GDP report growth slowing: Real GDP growing at 1.6% on an annualised basis represents the weakest quarterly gain for nearly two years. This figure was lower than the 2.4% expected by the consensus of economist forecasts and the latest estimate from the Atlanta Fed, which estimated GDP at 2.7%. Despite consumption remaining strong, inventory accumulation was subdued, subtracting 0.4 percentage points from the figure. However, if consumers keep spending and consumption remains strong, we expect this will increase during the coming quarters as businesses look to replenish stock. A narrowing in net exports took 0.9 percentage points off the headline figure, while government expenditure added 0.2 percentage points. Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, suggests today’s data could well be revised in future: “We knew the economy was weaning itself off government support, we just didn’t figure that would cause GDP to drop this quickly. With government spending down, and consumer spending moderating as Covid-era supports disappear, GDP fell below all estimates. But consumers continue to spend at a healthy rate, especially as evidenced by big spending on imports, which drove down the topline GDP number. First quarter GDP is often squirrelly and heavily revised—just look at last year’s—so all-in-all this shouldn’t be taken as a fundamental downshift in the economy.” Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, suggests the GDP report could dampen market optimism: “Today’s figures show that the economy has grown less than what was expected. Robust economic data in areas such as manufacturing and the job market have set market predictions for GDP on an upward trajectory for the past few weeks, the numbers released today indicate that spectators may have jumped the gun with these estimates. Looking ahead, we might expect to see these figures temper the bullish narrative that pushed the market to record highs in the first few months of this year. But for inflation, today’s report may be a more positive signal. High levels of economic activity also keep inflation elevated and to cut interest rates, the Fed is awaiting substantial evidence that inflation is trending lower. While today’s report might not be the full story that the Fed is looking for, it may be the prequel.” The US GDP report also shows that inflationary pressures remained solid in the first quarter of this year. It shows that the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 3.1% in the first quarter, accelerating from the increase of 1.9% in the fourth quarter. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 3.4%, compared with an increase of 1.8% in the previous three months. The core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy prices, increased 3.7%, compared with an increase of 2.0% in Q4 2023. US economic growth in the last quarter was dragged back by weak global demand. Today’s GDP report shows that net exports and inventories dragged on growth. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, explains: Exports ended up increasing by only 0.9%, illustrating the impact of weak global demand, while imports surged by 7.2%. Altogether, net exports subtracted nearly 0.9% points from GDP growth, with inventories generating an additional drag of nearly 0.4 percentage points. Some snap reaction to the slowdown in US growth in the last quarter: Newsflash: Growth across the US economy has slowed sharply this year, suggesting high interest rates are weighing on the economy. US GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.6% in the first quarter of 2024, new data shows, meaning it only expanded by 0.4% in the quarter. That’s a slowdown on the fourth quarter of 2023, when real GDP increased at 3.4% per year (or by 0.85% in the quarter). It’s also weaker than the 2.4% annualised growth which analysts had expected. The Bureau of Economic Analysis explains: Compared to the fourth quarter, the deceleration in real GDP in the first quarter primarily reflected decelerations in consumer spending, exports, and state and local government spending and a downturn in federal government spending. These movements were partly offset by an acceleration in residential fixed investment. Imports accelerated. One of Anglo American’s largest shareholders has criticised BHP Group’s takeover proposal. Legal &amp; General Investment Management warned that the approach by BHP to acquire Anglo for £31.1bn was both “highly opportunistic” and “unattractive”. Nick Stansbury, head of climate solutions at Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), told Reuters in an email today: “As with many other UK-listed companies, we believe the valuation of Anglo American to be depressed and regard the proposed exchange ratio as an unattractive proposition for long-term investors. The industry is extremely concentrated today, and further consolidating it will not contribute to accelerating investment in the way we believe is needed.” Legal &amp; General Investment Management are the 11th largest shareholder in Anglo American, according to LSEG data, owning 0.88% of the company. Just in: South Africa’s minerals resources minister has voiced his opposition to BHP’s £31bn proposal to take over Anglo American. Gwede Mantashe told the Financial Times he was not in favour of the bid because South Africa’s previous experience with BHP was “not positive”. That’s a reference to BHP’s merger with South Africa’s Billiton in 2001, a deal that was later effectively unwound in 2014 when many of the assets were spun off. More here. Just in: Shareholders in the London Stock Exchange Group have approved the plan to potentially double the pay of CEO David Schwimmer, with only a small rebellion. At today’s AGM, 88.99% of shares were cast in favour of approving the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, with 11.01% against. Around 83.5% of shareholders took part, meaning some declined to give a view on whether Schwimmer’s maximum total yearly remuneration should rise to up to £13m (mostly dependent on hitting performance-related targets). All other resolutions have been approved too. While some City-listed companies are eying a move overseas, Greek industrial conglomerate Mytilineos is considering a secondary listing in London. Mytilineos, which operates energy and metallurgy divisions, is currently listed on the Athens stock market. Today, it revealed it is considering also creating a listing on an international exchange within the next year to 18 months, to offer “enhanced liquidity” to its investors. Mytilineos has worked with various UK companies and organisations on energy projects, including LightSource BP, Vodafone, Centrica, National Grid and Scottish Power. Turkey’s central bank has left interest rates on hold today, at an eye-watering 50%. The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye maintained rates today, a month after surprising the market by hiking its key rate from 45% to 50%. Today, the CBRT explains that the underlying trend of monthly inflation was higher than expected this month, despite continuing to decline. Turkish interest rates have been raised by 4,150 basis points over the last year, from 8.5%. UK retailers have long been warning that theft from their stores is increasing… and new data from the Office for National Statistics confirms the problem. The ONS reports that shoplifting offences increased by 37% in 2023, to 430,104 offences, up from 315,040 in 2022. That the highest figure since current police recording practices began for the year ending March 2003. Last October, John Lewis chair Sharon White warned that “organised gangs” of shoplifters were targeting high-value items such as bottles of spirits. The ONS also reports that there were 8.4m incidents of crime last year, similar to 2022. But there were some annual changes in crime; fraud decreased by 16%, while criminal damage dropped 18%, but there was a 29% increase in computer misuse offences. The copper price has risen today, highlighting why BHP Group is keen to get its hands on Anglo American’s copper mines. Copper traded in London is up 0.7% this morning to $9,773 per tonne. BHP’s interest in Anglo could also be pushing the copper price higher, analysts at Saxo Bank say: Copper trades near cycle high as the potential of a mega-deal between BHP and Anglo-American highlights the importance and expectations for copper given its key role in the green transition and increased demand via AI roll outs. Shares in Facebook’s parent company are set to tumble when Wall Street opens in three hours time, after it alarmed traders by outlining plans to “invest aggressively” in artificial intelligence. Meta beat forecasts with a 27% rise in revenues in the first quarter of the year, while its net profits doubled. But shares are currently down 13.7% in premarket trading. Investors are concerned that Meta has ramped up its spending plans, with capital expenditures now seen in a $35bn-$40bn range, up from a previous forecast of $30bn-$37bn. Mark Zuckerberg was unbowed by concerns about his spending on artificial intelligence, saying the priority was “getting millions or billions of people to use Meta AI” rather than generating revenue from it. Today could be Meta’s worst on the stock market in 18 months, since it reported in October 2022 that profits had halved as advertisers cut spending amid the global economic downturn. Eek. UK retailers have just gone through their worst April for sales since the pandemic lockdown four years ago, new data shows. The CBI’s distributive trades survey, which tracks whether retailers reported higher or lower sales volumes, has fallen to -44, down from +2 in March. The decline is probably related to the early timing of Easter this year, the CBI adds. Here’s the details: AstraZeneca’s boss has defended his pay package as necessary to ensure the company can attract a high-calibre successor one day, as he hailed “unprecedented” lung cancer trial results, and cancer treatments propelled sales at Britain’s biggest drugmaker higher. Pascal Soriot, chief executive of the Anglo-Swedish pharma company, has come under fire for his potential £18.7m maximum pay package, which was recently approved despite a sizeable shareholder rebellion. He told journalists: “Of course, I am committed to this company. It really is about making the company competitive and attractive for my successor because I intend to be here for a while still but of course at some point there will be a successor, and our internal candidates but also external candidates will have to be offered a role that is attractive in itself but also compensated competitively. We are not a UK domestic organisation, we are a UK-based global company. Most of our sales come from outside of this country… And this industry is a global industry and… a lot of the talent is based in the United States… The innovation in our industry is now more and more driven by the United States and China. Europe is unfortunately falling behind.” The drugmaker beat analysts’ expectations with a 19% rise in total revenues in the first three months of the year to $12.7bn. Oncology drug sales grew by 26% while cardiovascular and metabolic treatments grew by 23%, respiratory drugs by 17% and rare disease treatments by 16%. Soriot said recent trial results for Tagrisso and Imfinzi, two of its blockbuster cancer drugs, were “unprecedented in lung cancer”. Tagrisso showed “overwhelming efficacy” in a trial for non-small cell lung cancer in February while Imfinzi was the first and only immunotherapy treatment to show survival benefit in small cell lung cancer. Soriot said that AstraZeneca is moving the weight loss pill it is developing with the Chinese company Eccogene into intermediate clinical trials. It is targeting people who want to lose a limited amount of weight (5-10% of body weight), as well as obese people who will receive a higher dose. It intends to combine the GLP-1 drug, which aims to reduce appetite, with other drugs the firm is working on to help people lose weight and reduce the risk of heart disease. Recent research from Morgan Stanley has shown that people using GLP-1 drugs such as Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound reduce their consumption of tobacco and alcohol – an added health benefit beyond weight loss. The drugs have proved hugely popular with celebrities and others, despite their high price tag, and have brought in billions of dollars of revenues for Novo and Eli. The boss of the London Stock Exchange group says the listings pipeline for the market is “encouraging”, even as BHP plots to remove Anglo American from the roster. David Schwimmer told the exchange’s annual shareholder meeting this morning that: “We are very pleased with the direction of travel for the London market.” In the UK housing market, builder Persimmon has reaffirmed its annual home-build targets after its sales rate picked up this year. CEO Dean Finch says trading over recent weeks has been encouraging with robust visitor numbers and enquiries, which gives Persimmon confidence about its outlook for the remainder of the year. Finch adds: Overall, our private forward order book is up 18% on the prior year with the embedded private average selling price ahead of the position at the start of the year. Speaking of Sainsbury’s…. its customers have faced disruption to online orders on Thursday morning due to a new “technical issue” at the retailer. The UK’s second largest supermarket chain said the issue affected a small number of customers but has now been resolved. A spokeswoman for the company said: “A small technical issue affected some groceries online orders this morning. “We have contacted these customers directly to apologise for the inconvenience.” Several shoppers have flagged problems on X: Sainsbury’s say they are working to sort the tech issues as quickly as possible. The boss of UK supermarket group Sainsbury’s has warned that delays to shipments through the Red Sea have led to “a bit” of disruption to clothing supplies in the last few months. Simon Roberts also told reporters this morning that food inflation is likely to remain in “low single digits” this year Roberts was speaking after Sainsbury’s told shareholders it was confident of delivering strong profit growth in the year ahead. It reported a 15% drop in pretax profits for the year to 2 March 2024 this morning, although underlying profits rose 1.6%. The London stock market rally continues, with the FTSE 100 hitting a new intraday record high of 8102.14 points this morning. The 0.7% rally is being driven by Anglo American, and also relief at the strong results from AstraZeneca and Unilever this morning. The jump in Anglo American’s share price morning, close to BHP’s offer, suggests. there is a reasonably high probability of the proposal succeeding, says Andrew Keen of investment research and consultancy firm Edison Group. Keen adds, though, that the deal is likely to take some time to play out. Premiums for successful M&amp;A in large cap mining are often in the order of 30%. Anglo’s announcement indicates that the approach has been made on an all-share basis, but cash components can be used as sweeteners and initial offers are often improved. Anglo has had a spate of operational issues recently and now needs to argue it is the best owner of its assets. If an alternative bidder emerges, its likely the debate will switch to the value of the competing offers. The prospect of Anglo American being taken over comes at “crisis time” for the London stock exchange, argues Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. He explains: “The London stock market is shrinking fast as companies are either taken over, switch listing to the US or delist to get out of the public’s eye. It’s crisis time for the London Stock Exchange as it fights to preserve the integrity of the UK market.” BHP’s interest comes at a tricky time for LSE boss David Schwimmer, with shareholders due to vote today on whether his maximum pay packet should be almost doubled. Although Anglo’s shares have surged 13%, shares in BHP’s London-listed shares are down 2.5% this morning. BHP was removed from the FTSE 100 in 2021 after deciding to shift its main listing to Sydney, and abandon a dual listing in London. UK advertising spend reached £36.6bn in 2023 representing a real term contraction of 1.2% and underscoring the brutal advertising downturn in TV, regional media and magazine advertising, according to a new report. The UK’s advertising market rose by 6.1% last year, but this equates to a 1.2% contraction in real terms after accounting for high inflation, according to the latest annual Advertising Association/WARC Expenditure analysis. Advertising is seen as a bellwether of the economic climate and in the past year the sector has been buffeted as corporate clients cut back on spending. This has hit broadcasters such as ITV and Channel 4. Dame Carolyn McCall, chief executive of ITV last year said that the industry was in the “worst advertising recession since the global financial crisis.” The AA/ WARC report found that TV advertising spend fell almost 9% dropping from £5.3bn in 2022 to £4.9bn last year. Advertising spend in magazine brands was also hit badly falling 9% from £553.8m in 2022 to £503.3m last year and in regional media brands it fell almost 10% from £505.2m in 2022 to £454.2m last year. The report is more optimistic about 2024 forecasting that advertising spend will rise by 5.8% to reach £38.8bn in 2024. Advertisers will be investing more in brand-building campaigns in 2024, the report says which will help an advertising recovery along with a number of high profile sporting events such as the Euro football championships in June, and the Paris Olympics in July along with the upcoming UK general election. James McDonald, director of data, intelligence &amp; forecasting at WARC, said: “Our latest survey of media owners confirms 2023 as a challenging year for most, with few properties recording gains and spend instead further consolidating within search and online display formats– particularly social media. “Our forecasts assume that the UK’s economy will begin to break from the pattern of stagnation that has come to define recent quarters. Easing inflation over the coming 18 months should encourage more favourable trading conditions within the advertising sector, facilitating growth across a broader range of channels in turn.” Interestingly, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Anglo American is considering a sale of its diamond business De Beers. The WSJ says Anglo has had discussions with potential buyers, in a separate process from BHP’s takeover bid. It adds: The London-listed company has held conversations in recent weeks with potential buyers, including luxury houses and Gulf sovereign-wealth funds, the people said. Anglo has signaled to potential suitors that it is open to offers, according to people familiar with the matter. This plan wouldn’t appear to derail BHP’s ambitions, given it appears to be interested in Anglo’s copper production arm. Forbes are reporting that the De Beers diamond business is “certain to be sold” if the BHP deal goes through. BHP’s proposal to buy Anglo American is a “monster” deal, says analyst Neil Wilson of Markets.com. He explains: Anglo shares jumped 11% at the open. Anglo has not had a great year – the rally this morning has erased the losses of the last 12 months, just. It’s got the assets but is not maybe doing as well as it might; in December the company downgraded its production targets. BHP clearly wants the copper assets – it’s not long after buying Oz Minerals. Clearly, competition authorities would take note due to the position in copper a combined company would have. South African platinum and iron ore assets would be spun off, which could be politically sensitive. If BHP doesn’t make it work, others may try. Shares trade at £24.80, a little shy of the £25.08 implied by the offer – not much discount, suggesting it’s a) being treated seriously and b) could go higher. BHP boss Mike Henry has previously said he will take a disciplined approach to M&amp;A – bulging coffers thanks to bumper profits in recent years may test that resolve. Long term mega trends suggest demand for metals is only going to increase. BHP Group is trying to take advantage of Anglo American’s recent weakness by making its takeover proposal, says Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The biggest headline-grabber today is news that BHP has made a buyout approach for Anglo American. Anglo’s exposure to copper compared to other listed miners is core area of BHP’s focus, as it looks to benefit from the material as the energy transition gathers pace. At the same time, BHP is looking to make hay while the sun shines on the gold price, but a deal of this magnitude does little to reassure investors it’s prioritising cost targets. BHP is also taking advantage of Anglo’s more recent weakness, which has seen it review its assets and write down their value. Should the deal go ahead, it would interrupt the long-term potential for Anglo investors, at a time when a turnaround is likely. If the deal happens, it would add to a global flurry of M&amp;A, and also be BHP’s second major acquisition in around a year. The move also suggests we could see further offers coming to the table for some of Anglo’s other assets, as well as for other smaller companies. BHP Group’s pursuit of Anglo American has driven the UK’s blue-chip share index to a new alltime high. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 58 points, or 0.7%, to hit 8098.14 points. That’s a new intraday high, for the third day in a row. Anglo American (+13%) is the top riser on the FTSE 100, but it’s not the only factor pushing stocks higher. It’s followed by pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca, (+5.5%) which beat City forecasts for revenuees and profits this morning, including a 26% jump in oncology revenues. In third place is Unilever (+4%), which has beaten sales forecasts for the first quarter and reported strong sales growth for its Dove, Knorr, Rexona and Sunsilk brands. Then its Barclays (+3.4%), after reporting a 12% drop in profits which was less severe than expected. Boom! Shares in Anglo American have surged by over 10% at the start of trading in London. They’ve jumped by 13% to £24.96, up from £22.05 last night, as traders react to the news that BHP Group has proposed a £31.1bn takeover for its smaller rival. As flagged at 7.55am, BHP says its offer values Anglo’s shares at £25.08. Newsflash: BHP Group has confirmed that it made a takeover proposal for Anglo American. In a statement to the City, BHP says it “notes the announcement by Anglo American” overnight, and confirms that it made its proposal just over a week ago, on 16th April. The proposal value Anglo American’s share capital at £31.1bn, higher than its current market capitalisation of £29bn. BHP insists the plan would deliver value for Anglo American shareholders. It says: The combination would bring together the strengths of BHP and Anglo American in an optimal structure. Anglo American would bring its assets and long-term growth potential. BHP would bring its higher margin cash generative assets and growth projects along with its larger free cash flows and stronger balance sheet. The combined entity would have a leading portfolio of large, low-cost, long-life Tier 1 assets focused on iron ore and metallurgical coal and future facing commodities, including potash and copper. These would be expected to generate significant cash flows and the combined entity would have the financial capacity to support value adding growth projects at the optimal time, while continuing BHP’s commitment to shareholder returns. As flagged earlier, the plan involves Anglo spinning off its platinum and iron ore interests first. Shareholders would receive £4.86 worth of shares in Anglo Platinum, and £3.40 of Kumba Iron Ore, as well as 0.7097 BHP shares for each ordinary share in Anglo American they currently own. BHP says the deal is worth £25.08 per Anglo American ordinary share, ahead of last night’s closing price of £22.05, and that it offers a 31% premium on the implied market value of Anglo American’s unlisted assets. BHP’s pursuit of Anglo comes on a busy morning for corporate news in London. Barclays bank has reported a 12% drop in pre-tax profits for the last financial year. The decline was partly due to lower income from deposits and mortgages, as higher interest rate weigh on business, and weaker income from investment banking. C. S. Venkatakrishnan, Barclays CEO, says the bank is focused on executing the shake-up plan announced in February (which will cut costs and jobs), adding: We have now announced the sale of our performing Italian mortgage book and are investing in our higher returning UK consumer businesses, including through the expected completion of the Tesco Bank acquisition in Q424. IF BHP was to take control of Anglo, the combined company would produce around 10% of global output of copper, Reuters points out. BHP’s proposal to Anglo could potentially flush out other rival suiters, who are also keen to own its copper mines. Bloomberg explains: “If BHP does indeed continue to pursue this deal, we would be surprised if other bidders do not emerge,” analysts from Jefferies LLC led by Christopher Lafemina said in an emailed note. A bid that values Anglo at $42.6 billion — a 28% premium based on its latest share price — might get a deal “across the finish line,” they said. Copper hit a two-year high earlier this month, with traders betting that supply will struggle to keep up with demand. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. There’s takeover excitement in the mining world this morning after Australia’s BHP made a takeover approach for smaller rival Anglo American The deal, if completed, would be one of the largest in the sector for years, and create the world’s biggest copper miner. Anglo confirmed overnight that it had received an “unsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional” all-share buyout proposal from BHP Group, which it is currently examining. The proposal is conditional on Anglo first splitting off its South African platinum and iron ore units, suggesting BHP is primarily interested in Anglo’s copper resources. Anglo says: The Board is currently reviewing this proposal with its advisers. There can be no certainty that any offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any such offer might be made. Pending any further announcements Anglo American shareholders should take no action. A further announcement will be made as and when appropriate. Anglo had been seen as a potential takeover target since late last year, when it warned that production had been weaker than expected. Shares are down around 10% over the last 12 months. BHP’s interest in acquiring Anglo raises fresh concerns about an exodus of UK firms from London. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: ‘’The buyout offer from BHP, the world’s largest publicly listed miner, for Anglo American, won’t just shake up the mining industry, but will send a fresh chill through the City of London There are concerns that if the deal goes through it could be the tip of the iceberg and more giants could leave the exchange. It comes hot on the heels of speculation that Shell might up sticks and leave for New York, rumours that Ocado may be considering leaving for the Big Apple, and follows the crushing disappointment of home-grown chip designer Arm choosing the Nasdaq over the FTSE 100.

        "title": "Shareholders back £7m pay rise for London Stock Exchange boss",
        "content": "Shareholders have voted in favour of doubling the pay packet of London Stock Exchange Group’s chief executive to £13m on the same day that fears were reignited about an exodus of UK-listed firms. Investors backed the group’s plans to increase David Schwimmer’s maximum pay levels from £6.25m to more than £13m. The resolution passed, with nearly 89% voting in favour of the new pay policy. The LSEG annual shareholder meeting was held as it emerged that two large UK-listed companies, Unilever and Anglo American, may leave the London market for lucrative deals and listings abroad. The Australian mining company BHP has a £31bn offer for rival Anglo American, a move that could result in the cancellation of FTSE 100-listed firm’s UK shares. Two years ago, BHP dropped its dual Australia-UK listing in favour of a single home on the Sydney stock exchange. Meanwhile, the chief executive of Unilever, Hein Schumacher, said the consumer goods company was “considering all options” for a potential listing of its ice-cream business, which makes brands including Magnum and Ben &amp; Jerry’s, and could be valued at up to €17bn (£14.6bn). Schumacher said he was “talking to many different stakeholders in the process” and had discussed a potential Amsterdam listing with the Dutch economic affairs minister. However, he did not confirm whether he met the equivalent UK minister, raising fears that London could miss out on another bumper stock market float. Schumacher added that he had “regular conversations with governments including the UK government”. There has been much handwringing in the City and Whitehall over an exodus of listed firms from the London stock market. Those leaving include the travel group Tui, which will shift its listing to Germany, and the Dublin-based betting firm Flutter, which is asking shareholders to consider moving its shares to the US market. Schwimmer tried to appear upbeat, telling shareholders on Thursday the pipeline of floats was “encouraging” and that a pending shake-up of listings rules, which include simplifying some requirements for companies, would be helpful. “We are very pleased with the direction of travel for the London market,” he said. The influential shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis had advised shareholders to reject Schwimmer’s pay policy, saying in a report this month that the company had not “sufficiently rationalised an increase of this magnitude in a lump sum approach, particularly given the CEO’s pay relative to UK peers”. However, Schwimmer had argued that the group had to compete with peers in the US, where executives can expect much higher renumeration. “If London has an ambition to be a globally leading financial centre and to attract world-class companies, that means it has to attract world-class talent,” he said in February. LSEG said this month that it was “focused on securing and retaining the calibre of talent required in a highly competitive global market” while “ensuring delivery of strong performance” was rewarded.",

        "title": "MPs call for clarity over post-Brexit border checks on EU plant and food products",
        "content": "MPs have cast doubt over the UK government’s readiness for post-Brexit border control checks, which are due to come in next week, arguing that a scaling back of its plans appeared to represent a sixth delay to their long-awaited introduction. The environment, food and rural affairs select committee (EFRA) has written to the government demanding clarity over the exact nature of the physical inspections on plant and food products, after it emerged these may be significantly scaled back due to fears of delays at the border. On Tuesday, the government is scheduled to begin checks on medium and high-risk plant and animal imports from the EU, as part of its Border Target Operating Model (BTOM) plan. However, the Financial Times reported last week that large parts of the risk management system for all commodity groups would not initially be switched on, after concerns within government that the border systems would not be fully ready. The government insisted that checks would begin but said some would be delayed, with inspectors focusing on the highest risk products before scaling up to a more comprehensive regime in the future. Robert Goodwill, the chair of the EFRA committee, demanded clarity from the government over what the latest delays entailed and details on what a graduated approach to the sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks would look like in practice. In a letter to the environment secretary, Steve Barclay, Goodwill said it was clear that ports and businesses were facing further uncertainty and were “confused and frustrated” over the delivery of these essential border controls. He said: “There is broad consensus that a clearly communicated, phased implementation of SPS checks with distinct, achievable milestones is a strategic and pragmatic approach to change. “We are concerned that your approach, if as reported, has resulted from poor planning and delivery of the model.” Goodwill added: “We are concerned that this is a sixth delay to the implementation of SPS import checks in all but name.” Physical checks at the border were first scheduled to be introduced in July 2021 but were pushed back as several border control posts were unfinished. There have been four subsequent delays, with the last one taking place in August 2023. Last week, trade bodies described the border system as being in “complete disarray” after the latest delay to checks emerged, with some warning that the confusion around the government’s plans made it difficult for businesses to plan. Businesses have repeatedly complained about being left in the dark over aspects of the government’s border plans. This includes delays to publishing crucial details about how much it will cost businesses to have plant and animal goods coming through the Port of Dover and Channel tunnel. Despite a public consultation running last summer, and details being promised before the end of 2023, the specifics of the common user charge were only published earlier this month, 27 days before the checks were due to come in. Ports have also complained that they have not received crucial information from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) about inspector staffing arrangements and opening hours. The letter from the committee pointed to these as examples of the government’s “inconsistent messaging”, and also questioned why the committee had not been informed of any changes to the government’s approach. Goodwill wrote: “It is essential that Defra urgently takes steps to communicate the changed arrangements to businesses and the public to build confidence in our incoming border controls and reduce disruption.” The committee has demanded details on the percentage of goods that the government intends to check by next Tuesday, as well as monthly updates on the progress of the inspections regime. A government spokesperson said: “Taking a pragmatic approach to introducing our new border checks minimises disruption, protects our biosecurity and benefits everyone – especially traders. “There has been extensive engagement with businesses over the past year – with our approach welcomed by several trade associations and port authorities. “We are confident we have sufficient capacity and capability across all points of entry to handle the volume and type of expected checks.”",

        "title": "Oil price could exceed $100 a barrel if Middle East conflict worsens, World Bank warns",
        "content": "A serious escalation of tensions in the Middle East would push the price of oil above $100 (£80) a barrel and reverse the recent downward trend in global inflation, the World Bank has said. The Washington-based institution said the recent fall in commodity prices had been levelling off even before the recent missile strikes by Iran and Israel – making interest rate decisions for central banks tougher. But it added that its forecast that crude prices would average $84 a barrel this year would prove too optimistic in the event of the crisis worsening. Fears of a full-scale war in the Middle East have already led to a rise in oil prices and dearer fuel costs for motorists. A barrel of Brent crude is trading at $87, while the average price of a litre of unleaded petrol in the UK has edged above £1.50 for the first time since last November. The World Bank’s latest commodity markets report said: “A moderate conflict-related supply disruption could raise the average Brent price this year to $92 a barrel. A more severe disruption could see oil prices surpass $100 a barrel, raising global inflation in 2024 by nearly one percentage point.” Between mid-2022 and mid-2023, global commodity prices plummeted by nearly 40% and were the driving force behind a near-two-percentage-point drop in global inflation over that period. Since mid-2023, the World Bank said its index of commodity prices had remained essentially unchanged. Financial markets have already pared back expectations about the scale and pace of interest rate cuts this year in response to stickier than expected inflation. Indermit Gill, the World Bank chief economist, said: “Global inflation remains undefeated. A key force for disinflation – falling commodity prices – has essentially hit a wall. “That means interest rates could remain higher than currently expected this year and next. The world is at a vulnerable moment: a major energy shock could undermine much of the progress in reducing inflation over the past two years.” The World Bank said an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East could also drive up prices of natural gas, fertilisers and food. A fifth of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports pass through the strait of Hormuz and, if the supply were interrupted, prices of fertilisers reliant on LNG in their production would rise substantially, with the likely effect of driving up food prices. Assuming the crisis does not deepen, the Bank’s baseline forecast is for overall food prices to decline by 6% in 2024 and 4% in 2025. Fertiliser prices are expected to fall by 22% in 2024 and 6% in 2025. The World Bank said the pickup in investment in green technologies had pushed up prices of key metals that were critical for the global clean-energy transition. Prices of copper, which is needed for electricity-grid infrastructure and electric vehicles, surged to a two-year high in April and were expected to rise 5% in 2024 before stabilising in 2025. Prices of aluminium are forecast to increase by 2% in 2024 and 4% in 2025, bolstered in particular by the production of electric vehicles, solar panels and other renewable-power infrastructure.",

        "title": "Barclays profits tumble 12% as UK interest rates hit mortgage demand",
        "content": "Profits at Barclays tumbled by 12% in the first quarter, as higher UK interest rates weighed on demand for mortgages and loans while a backdrop of economic uncertainty affected its investment bank. The UK bank said pre-tax profits fell to £2.3bn in the first quarter, down from £2.6bn last year, when it reported the strongest quarterly profit since 2011 after a string of interest rate hikes by the Bank of England. While UK interest rates have since risen to 5.25%, allowing banks to charge more for loans and mortgages, the resulting pressure on households has dampened the appetite for borrowing. Barclays said loans and advances to customers fell by 1% in the quarter, “reflecting subdued mortgage lending amid lower market demand”. However, executives confirmed the bank was increasing the share of high loan-to-value mortgages offered to customers, which could support a rebound in its loan book. At the same time, banks such as Barclays have been under pressure to raise interest rates for savers, further squeezing its income. Competition has also been tough, with customers placing their cash with more generous rivals, and prompting a 2% drop in deposits at Barclays. Overall, Barclays said net interest income, which accounts for the difference between money made from loans and money paid out for savings, at its UK bank fell by 4% to £1.5bn. However, slightly brighter forecasts for the UK economy meant Barclays only put aside £58m for potential defaults, compared with £113m last year. “Consumer behaviour continues to be very robust in the UK,” said the bank’s chief financial officer, Anna Cross. “We see customers managing their spending well and wisely. We also see continued conservative behaviour … so they continue to seek higher savings rates, and secure their mortgage financing early.” Investors who had been holding out for better performance from Barclays’ investment bank, after bumper profits for Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs, will have been disappointed with a 12% drop in pre-tax profits to £1.4bn. While it benefited from a rebound in the number of companies seeking to raise cash from investors on the stock market, it was hit by a drop in demand for its fixed-income services, which work in commodities, currencies and bonds. The chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, said the fixed income department’s earnings were “not as strong as we would have liked”. The poor performance will help justify a corporate shake-up and a £2bn cost-cutting programme, announced by executives in February. The overhaul involved plans to shrink the size of the investment banking division, and shift more of the lenders’ focus to the “higher returning” consumer and corporate businesses. Venkatakrishnan said the lender was “focused on disciplined execution of the plan” and had already delivered about £200m in savings of the £1bn he aimed to achieve this year. The bank, which has 94,400 global staff, did not give any further updates on pending job cuts. Barclays slashed 5,000 roles between October and December last year.",

        "title": "Car insurance firms agree to crack down on ‘poverty premium’",
        "content": "Insurers have promised to clean up their act after coming under fire over the “poverty premium”, whereby customers who cannot afford to pay for car insurance in one go are charged punitive interest to spread the cost. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said its members had agreed to an action plan aimed at managing the cost of paying monthly for motor insurance. The pledges include companies giving customers clear cost comparisons between the two payment options and publishing the average finance charge. One of the tenets of what the ABI calls its premium finance principles is that when setting prices, insurers heed that “many consumers cannot afford to pay for their insurance upfront, in one lump sum, and so charges for paying by monthly instalments can fall hardest on those who can least afford it”. Insurers should also ensure charges are “reasonable”, relative to the costs of providing premium finance for monthly payments, the code says. And they should consider how the charges stack up against other payment options, such as using a credit card. Insurers give customers the choice of paying one annual premium or in monthly instalments. However, while the monthly payments are lower, the overall cost is typically higher because the premiums are treated as a loan, with an interest rate added to the payment. The interest rates available span 20.50% and 36.33%, according to research by the consumer rights group Which?. Premium finance has become increasingly contentious as the price of car insurance and household bills continue to soar during the cost of living crisis. Car insurance has risen by 43% over the past 12 months, according to Confused.com. It puts the average cost of a comprehensive car insurance policy at £941, an increase of £284 over the past year. The ABI defended the industry, saying that in 2023 claims inflation pushed up the cost of premiums by 25%. It pointed to analyst estimates that for every £1 paid in premiums that year, insurers incurred £1.14 in claims and expenses. Premium finance has also been on the radar of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which has twice written to insurance company bosses reminding them of their duty to offer customers fairly priced products. The ABI, which said it would publish a report on the plan’s impact, said while a voluntary industry-led cap on premium finance charges was considered and discussed with the FCA, the principles “represent what is possible within the limits allowed by competition laws and provide a basis for firms to take meaningful action”. Rocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said: “Car insurance is a legal requirement for motorists, yet many people who can’t afford to pay for their annual premiums in one go are being hit with eye-watering levels of interest on monthly payments of up to nearly 40%, which can add on hundreds of pounds a year. “While it’s good to see the insurance industry finally recognising that this is a huge problem, waiting another year for the ABI to publish its findings when insurers should already be doing this is not good enough. “The FCA needs to make clear where insurance companies’ pricing practices are failing to meet fair value requirements, and set deadlines for firms falling short to fix this.”",

        "content": "Ryanair has demanded that the EU reform its skies after the airline was forced to cancel more than 300 flights across Europe scheduled for Thursday because of a strike by French air traffic controllers. The cancellations come in spite of the withdrawal of strike action by one of the biggest unions, the SNCTA, which came too late to avoid disruption after France’s civil aviation authority asked airlines to cut flights. Ryanair said 50,000 of its passengers would be affected because of France’s failure to protect overflights – where planes fly over the country without landing there – during industrial action. It said most of the disrupted passengers would be simply flying over French airspace en route to the likes of Greece or Spain. The airline called on the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to take action to protect overflights by law during air traffic control strikes, to allow Europe’s other controllers to manage flights over France during the strikes, and limit the power of unions to call strikes immediately. Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary said: “French air traffic controllers are free to go on strike, that’s their right, but we should be cancelling French flights, not flights leaving Ireland, going to Italy, or flights from Germany to Spain or Scandinavia to Portugal. “The European Commission under Ursula von der Leyen has failed for five years to take any action to protect overflights and the single market for air travel. We’re again calling on her to take action to protect overflights which will eliminate over 90% of these flight cancellations.” Despite the French strike this week, O’Leary said he believed air travellers would see significantly less disruption over summer 2024 than during the past two years, when labour shortages and strikes limited capacity.",

        "title": "Designer brands owed millions after Matchesfashion collapse",
        "content": "Designer brands including Gucci and Anya Hindmarch have been left millions of pounds out of pocket and some customers will not get refunds after online fashion site Matchesfashion collapsed owing more than £210m last month. Customers who bought designer items prior to the administration are not able to return items or get a refund, according to a report by administrators published on Wednesday. Matches, founded in 1987 as a boutique in the London suburb of Wimbledon by husband and wife Tom and Ruth Chapman, collapsed on 8 March after it was hit by widespread discounting and softening demand for luxury fashion. Matches was acquired by Mike Ashley’s Frasers in late 2023 for £52m in cash from the private equity firm Apax Partners. Frasers put in £33m to keep it trading. However, after a difficult Christmas, Frasers said it was unwilling to provide further funds and called in administrators from Teneo. The administrators said the retailer’s 541 known unsecured creditors – including customers, landlords and designer clothing suppliers – are owed at least £35.6m, and potentially as much as £100m, but are unlikely to collectively receive more than £800,000, or “less than a penny in the pound”. One Matches customer told the Guardian that she had returned products worth more than £500 in January but, after the administration, was told she would not be refunded. “I have been a very loyal customer to Matchesfashion since it started online, and bought regularly,” she said. “I feel abused! This is not acceptable.” Some suppliers – such as landlords, logistics companies security and IT providers – have been paid to ensure the retailer can continue to trade while administrators attempt to sell off the business. Administrators said they also expected to pay almost £300,000 owed to employees and £1.2m to tax authorities. Swedish label Toteme is the brand owed the most by Matches, according to the administrators report, with a debt of almost £1m. Burberry, Gucci and Max Mara are each owed about £500,000. Well-known British labels are also on the hook. Paul Smith and Samantha Cameron’s Cefinn are both owed more than £100,000 while Anya Hindmarch and Joseph are owed more than £200,000 each. Administrators said 190 suppliers had claimed ownership of almost £23m of stock and were seeking to retrieve it, but only £3.4m had been returned so far. Matches also owed £173m to Frasers and administrators said that this was unlikely to be repaid in full. Administrators cut 273 jobs last month, more than half of Matches’ workforce, while the chief executive, former Asos boss Nick Beighton, lost his job. Teneo said administrators had received 11 offers for Matches late last month and they were continuing to review bids. It is not clear if Frasers will seek to buy back the company amid a tough luxury market. Wealthy customers have been forced to rein in spending due to higher interest rates on mortgages and loans, and a 32% rise in average prices of luxury fashion since 2019, according to Teneo. Online specialists have been hit particularly hard. Retailer Farfetch agreed a controversial rescue deal with the South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang through a pre-pack administration in January. Richemont’s Yoox Net-a-Porter, which Farfetch had been lined up to buy, is heavily loss-making. On Wednesday, the owner of upmarket department store Harvey Nichols revealed that shareholders had pumped in more than £25m of new funds and made a further £7m available in the past year after it continued to post a loss. The retail group reported a £21.3m loss for the year to 1 April 2023, after a loss of £30.4m a year before, despite a 13% rise in sales to £217m. Debts rose to £82m from £63.4m but bank debt was paid off in favour of loans via shareholder Dickson Poon, the Hong Kong-based entrepreneur. • This article was amended on 25 April 2024. Farfetch had been lined up to buy Richemont’s Yoox Net-a-Porter, not the other way round.",

        "content": "Former president Donald Trump qualified for a bonus worth $1.2bn after shares in his social media company remained above a certain value despite falling sharply. Trump is poised to receive 36m additional shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG), owner of his Truth Social platform, under an “earn-out” windfall which boosts the paper value of his stake in the business to about $3.7bn. He was able to receive the bonus if TMTG’s stock traded above $17.50 a share for 20 days out of any 30-day period within the first three years of the firm’s stock market debut – a milestone it reached after closing at $32.57 on Tuesday. Trump’s shares in his social media company have offered him a financial lifeline as he faces about $500m in legal penalties after being found liable in civil fraud, defamation and sexual abuse cases. While he cannot sell his stock until September due to the terms of a lockup agreement, the shares’ fluctuating value have at times made him one of the world’s wealthiest people on paper. After a stunning landing on New York’s Nasdaq stock exchange, the value of Trump’s social media company – which trades as DJT – has fallen drastically. The stock hit a high of almost $80 on its opening day, but declined in fits in the following weeks. Trump Media’s CEO, Devin Nunes, has suggested that short sellers betting on the loss of value may have been responsible for manipulating the stock. Shares in Trump Media tanked further last week, falling 12% after the company revealed it could sell millions of additional shares in the coming months. They fell another 8% on Tuesday, even as they enabled Trump to qualify for his earn-out shares. The company has also faced political scrutiny over the firm’s financial backers. A Democratic-aligned group issued a call earlier this month for lawmakers to investigate the company over allegations of influence peddling, after the Guardian reported that a Russian-American businessman under federal criminal investigation helped prop up the company. Truth Social has become a personal soapbox for Trump to issue statements to his supporters since its launch in 2022. While its user base is tiny compared with more established social networks, such as X (formerly Twitter), the platform has outgrown other rightwing apps. Trump is now on trial in a Manhattan courtroom, with prosecutors alleging that he sought to undermine the 2016 presidential election through making illegal hush-money payments to cover up his affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump’s defense lawyers have maintained he is innocent of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business documents, in what is the first criminal trial of a former president in US history.",

        "title": "The government shouldn’t boast about the latest CPI figures, but they shouldn’t panic either | Grogonomics",
        "content": "Despite what the fearmongers would have you believe, the latest inflation figures showed that inflation remains well under control. Not only is there no need for any more rate rises, but doing so would only increase the likelihood of unemployment rising, with little actual impact on inflation. There’s always danger with reporting on inflation figures because there’s more than enough figures flying around to enable commentators and politicians to push out a scare quote that has people thinking inflation is running rampant and, God help us, we’ll be soon carting around our money in wheelbarrows. I say calm down. We were once told that the “non-accelerating rate of unemployment” – the level of unemployment needed to stop inflation from rising – was around 4.5%. Right now unemployment is at 3.8% and yet annual inflation actually fell (or “decelerated”) from 4.1% to 3.6%. That is fantastic news. The 3.6% means inflation has fallen from the peak of 7.8% at much the same pace it rose to those heights: If the graph does not display click here The expectations were for a lower figure, and certainly the 1% March quarter increase is higher than we would get in normal times. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But let us look at what drove that increase. We know the Reserve Bank likes to worry about the rise in services prices, because services are generally labour intensive and therefore price rises can mean that wages are rising faster than the RBA would like. And yes, services did account for a large proportion of the 1% rise in the March quarter. But what type of services? Rent for example is classed as a service, and that was the biggest contributor to total inflation growth: If the graph does not display click here Just after rents came other service price rises like education (which always rises in March) and medical services. Down at the 10th biggest contributor to inflation growth came the service price rises of insurance. I look forward to being told by those thinking the RBA should raise rates to explain how a rate rise will slow the cost increases of rents, education, hospital services and insurance. The inflation growth of 3.6% does however mean real wages are now growing. The only problem is, although they have increased about 0.5% over the past year, they are still 6% below where they were three years ago: If the graph does not display click here Non-discretionary items also continue to rise faster than those items which people can do without (or at least can put off buying until some later date). That means those on lower incomes are still hit harder by price rises than those in wealthier households. Rent rises have been particularly tough for people across most of the country. Perth in particular has borne a massive hit. The 9.9% rent rise over the past year is the fastest rise there since the peak of the mining boom in 2008: If the graph does not display click here Earlier this month I suggested the RBA is unlikely to either cut or raise rates, and these latest figures do nothing to change my views on that. The RBA won’t cut rates unless unemployment rises sharply (which it hasn’t) or until inflation is well into the 2% to 3% range. What we are seeing is that the share of prices of the 87 items in the CPI basket of goods and services that are increasing by more than 5% is dropping. At the end of 2022, two-thirds of all items in the CPI basket were rising in price by more than 5% a year; now that is back to one-third of all items: If the graph does not display click here But the March quarter CPI figures are one of those odd economic numbers that actually have real consequences for people. The March figure is the last determinant of how much Hecs/Help debt will rise on 1 June. The formula sees an indexation on debt of 4.75% (which probably will be rounded up to 4.8%). That means those in their 20s with an average Hecs/Help debt will see their debt rise even after they make their compulsory repayments: If the graph does not display click here That was not how the system was meant to work. It is a consequence of the lowering of the repayment thresholds, the strong rise in prices that means indexation rises much more than anyone would have planned when undertaking their degree and also the increase in the cost of a degree that now mean people have much more Hecs/Help debt than in the past. The government will not be crowing about the latest CPI figures, but neither should it be panicking. There is no sign of anything other than a steady, if slow return to inflation below 3%. If it takes slightly longer than hopes for that to occur, so long as inflation is not accelerating there is little cause for great concern. Indeed, given unemployment is at 3.8%, it is clear that there is no need for unemployment to rise to 4.5% as the RBA had once suggested to stop inflation rising. But for those with Hecs/Help debts, the concern is very much present, and the pressure is on the government to deliver in the budget a fix to the Hecs/Help system that now looks quite broken. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

        "title": "Boeing blew through $4bn last quarter in response to 737 Max blowout incident",
        "content": "Boeing burned through nearly $4bn in the last quarter as it scrambled to contain a safety crisis unleashed by a mid-flight blowout of a cabin panel on a brand-new 737 Max 9 jet. The US planemaker has been left reeling by the incident in January, which raised questions about its bestselling commercial plane, and warnings from a whistleblower about other sections of its production line. After racing to reassure regulators, airlines and passengers, Dave Calhoun, Boeing’s chief executive, and Larry Kellner, chair of its board, last month announced plans to resign. While the company reported its first quarterly revenue drop in almost two years on Wednesday, its results nevertheless beat expectations on Wall Street, which were lowered after January’s blowout during an Alaska Airlines flight prompted Boeing to slow production. The company said its first-quarter cash burn, a metric closely watched by investors, was $3.93bn; lower than the average analyst forecast of $4.49bn. In March, Boeing indicated it would use between $4bn and $4.5bn as it grappled with the biggest safety crisis since the crashes of two of its Max 8 jets, in 2018 and 2019, in which 346 people were killed. Revenue at the firm sank 8% in the first three months of the year, to $16.57bn. Net losses narrowed to $355m, from $425m during the same period of 2023. Shares in Boeing, which have retreated by a third in recent months, rose 2% during early trading in New York. Since the Alaska incident, the US Federal Aviation Administration has imposed a cap on production of Boeing’s strong-selling 737 Max aircraft line. The FAA also has told Boeing to develop a comprehensive plan to address “systemic quality-control issues”. “Well it could have been worse,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said in a note. “While the loss and the cash outflow are not as bad as feared, the company is still clearly facing some serious challenges in the commercial aircraft division that will take some fixing.” Before the report, Calhoun said in a letter to employees that Boeing was “in a tough moment”, slowing the system to improve quality and safety. “Lower deliveries can be difficult for our customers and for our financials. But safety and quality must and will come above all else,” he added. While Boeing has yet to identify its next boss, Calhoun told the CNBC news network on Wednesday that he believes Stephanie Pope – currently the firm’s chief operating officer, and head of its commercial airplanes arm – has the potential to run the whole company. Some analysts have speculated in recent weeks that Boeing could choose an outsider, or at least a former insider who has since left the firm, to replace Calhoun. Cited names include Larry Culp, who led General Electric before the conglomerate’s breakup, and now leads GE Aerospace; and Greg Smith, the chairman of American Airlines and former chief financial officer at Boeing.

        "content": "The FTSE 100 index touched a new intraday all-time high of 8092.20 earlier today, and is now trading at 8066, up 0.27% and currently higher than yesterday’s record closing high of 8044 points. UK shares have been lifted by rate cut hopes and a slight easing of geopolitical tensions. The FTSE is is on track for its sixth consecutive session of gains, the first such winning streak since August 2023. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has dropped 0.4% to $88.10 a barrel. European stock markets have edged higher, and Wall Street is also up, with the Nasdaq gaining 0.7% boosted by tech stocks such as Tesla. Our main stories today: Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Take care – JK Italian luxury group Prada has posted 16% revenue growth in the first quarter, on the back of the success of its youth-focused brand Miu Miu. The family-owned company made sales of €1.19bn in the first three months of the year, above the €1.14bn forecast by analysts, despite a slowdown in the global luxury sector. Sales at Miu Miu jumped 89%, bringing in €233m for the fashion group, which was founded in 1913 in Milan by Mario Prada. Miu Miu accounts for 15% of group sales. Sales at the flagship label Prada grew by 7%. This contrasts with Gucci owner Kering’s latest profit warning. Europe and Asia Pacific, especially Japan, drove the sales growth, while the Americas lagged. Prada chairman Patrizio Bertelli said: Over the first quarter, we delivered a solid performance in a more challenging market environment. Chief Executive Andrea Guerra added: While the industry is experiencing new dynamics, we retain our ambition to deliver solid, sustainable and above market growth. Wall Street has opened higher, thanks to a boost from technology stocks, with Tesla leading gains, while other upbeat company results also lifted sentiment. While the electric carmaker Tesla’s first-quarter revenues disappointed, its promise to bring out new, cheaper models earlier than expected cheered investors, and its shares rose 11%. The Nasdaq climbed 126 points, or 0.8%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.3%. US durable goods orders rose by 2.6% in March from April, slightly more than expected. However, this was mainly due to the volatile transport component, noted Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics. There was a 31% rebound in non-defence aircraft orders amid the resumption of orders at Being, following its latest safety scandal at the start of the year (see my earlier post). Motor vehicle orders rose by 2.1%, helping to lift overall transport equipment by 7.7%. Core orders, excluding transport, edged up by just 0.2%, in part due to a 3.9% drop back in orders for computers and related products, following their strength in January and February. Boeing lost $355m in the first three months of the year as the US planemaker slowed production amid a renewed safety scandal when a door panel blew out of a plane in mid-air. The losses were smaller than investors had expected, although Dave Calhoun, Boeing’s chief executive, said that slower production would hit its financial performance. The incident - the result of bolts apparently removed by a contractor in the factory - has put Boeing’s safety record back in the spotlight after years of crisis following two fatal crashes of its bestselling 737 Max plane. Analysts had expected losses of $619m, according to forecasts collated by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Boeing’s revenues dropped to $16.5bn, down from $17.9bn in the same period last year. Calhoun, who will retire at the end of the year, wrote in a note to employees: We are using this period, as difficult as it is, to deliberately slow the system, stabilise the supply chain, fortify our factory operations and position Boeing to deliver with the predictability and quality our customers demand for the long term. As these efforts begin to take hold, we’re seeing early signs of more predictable, stable and efficient cycle times in our 737 factory, and expect this will continue to slowly improve. Near term, yes, we are in a tough moment. Lower deliveries can be difficult for our customers and for our financials. But safety and quality must and will come above all else. The boss of Schroders, Peter Harrison, is stepping down after eight years at the helm of the UK’s biggest asset manager. The company said it expects “an orderly transition during 2025 and Peter will remain as a director of the company throughout this period”. The firm, whose founding Schroders family remains its largest shareholder with a 44% stake, has hired headhunters to conduct a global search find a successor. Among potential internal candidates are chief financial officer Richard Oldfield, who joined from PwC in October; the firm’s global chief investment officer, Johanna Kyrklund; its global head of private assets, Georg Wunderlin; and group chief operating officer Meagen Burnett, the Financial Times reported. Harrison, one of the longest-serving financial services bosses in the FTSE 100, has been running Schroders since April 2016, taking charge two months before Britain voted to the leave the EU, which dented the City’s allure and the UK’s status as an investment hub. The group’s share price has lost 40% since peaking in September 2021. Elizabeth Corley, chair of Schroders, said: The board recognises that in Peter, Schroders has had an outstanding CEO over the past eight years. During his tenure, the business has undergone a remarkable transformation to become a global, diversified active investor across both public and private markets, as well as a leader in UK wealth management, more than doubling assets under management to over £750bn. Harrison joined Schroders in March 2013 as global head of investment, and previously served as chairman and CEO of investment boutique RWC Partners. He had started his career at Schroders in 1988 and also worked at JPMorgan and Deutsche Asset Management. He said: Having started my career as a graduate at Schroders, it has been an immense privilege to be CEO. I care about the firm and our people deeply. I believe that now is the right time for the board to begin the search for my successor. ‘In the US they think we’re communists!’ The 70,000 workers showing the world another way to earn a living.

When Marisa Fernández lost her husband to cancer a few years ago, her employers at the Eroski hypermarket went, she says, “above and beyond to help me through the dark days afterwards, rejigging my timetable and giving me time off when I couldn’t face coming in.” She had a chance to return the favour recently when the store, in Arrasate-Mondragón in Spain’s Basque Country, was undergoing renovations. Fernández, 58, who started on the cashier desk 34 years ago, and now manages the store’s non-food section, volunteered to work extra shifts over the weekend along with her colleagues to ensure everything was ready for Monday morning. “It’s not just me. Everyone is ready to go the extra mile,” she says. Such harmonious employer-worker relations are the stuff of corporate dreams, and they are no accident here: the Eroski retail chain is part of Mondragón Corporation, the largest industrial co-op in the world. As a fully signed-up member, Fernández co-owns part of the supermarket chain that also employs her. “It feels like mine,” she says. “We work hard, but it’s a totally different feeling from working for someone else.” That sentiment is echoed by Mondragón’s 70,000 other workers. Made up of 81 autonomous co-operatives, the corporation has grown since its creation in 1956 to become a leading force in the Basque economy. Eroski is one of its most conspicuous manifestations, with 1,645 outlets across Spain. In addition to food, the chain has profitable sidelines in white goods, electronics, insurance and holiday bookings. Factory orders in the UK continued to fall in April but at a slower pace, and optimism picked up to the highest level since mid-2021, according to a survey. The Confederation of British Industry’s latest manufacturing survey showed output volumes were broadly stable in the three months to April, following strong declines in output in the quarter to March. The total new orders balance showed a balance of -6%, compared with -13% in January, but manufacturers expect orders to return to growth in the next three months (+8%). The balance measures the number of those saying orders rose minus those who report falling orders. The business sentiment balance rose to +9%, from -3% in January. Manufacturers expect output to rise over the next three months, with expectations the strongest since October 2023. Average cost growth remained high compared to historical norms, while domestic and export price inflation are expected to pick up slightly in the coming months. Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist, said: Conditions facing manufacturers have taken a turn for the better, with sentiment improving and expectations for future output growth their strongest in six months. A softer labour market has eased concerns that skills and labour could constrain output and orders. Concerns about access to materials and components are also at their lowest since January 2020. These brighter conditions are supporting a more stable picture for investment over the year ahead. With the recovery still to fully pick up steam, we need to see everyone laser focused on delivering the big reforms that will help manufacturers grow and invest. Full capital expensing, with the potential to extend this to leased and rented assets, can be a game changer that unlocks the incredible power of our manufacturing sector and drives economic growth. Here’s our full story on Ofcom: GB News can continue to use politicians as presenters, after the media regulator Ofcom concluded the British public does not want to ban the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Lee Anderson from hosting programmes on news channels. Cristina Nicolotti Squires, the Ofcom executive responsible for broadcast regulation, said that while “many are instinctively uncomfortable” with politicians presenting current affairs programmes, there was “no clear consensus for an outright ban”. Instead, the media regulator will now explicitly require that GB News ensures serving politicians do not adopt the style and mannerisms of an unbiased newsreader, interviewer, or reporter – such as reading out a list of headlines directly to the audience. Ofcom also reiterated existing rules banning serving politicians from presenting programmes during an election – meaning GB News will have to fill large gaps in its schedule when Rishi Sunak finally goes to the country. The media regulator has faced growing criticism over how it applies its rules to GB News and whether the channel is being treated more leniently than traditional broadcasters. Last month GB News was found to have repeatedly breached impartiality rules by paying Conservative MPs hundreds of thousands of pounds to serve as news presenters and interview the prime minister, Sunak. But rather than impose sanctions on GB News, the regulator instead simply put the channel “on notice” and warned it against further breaches. GB News has broken broadcasting rules on 12 occasions in the last 18 months, with a further eight investigations in progress. The Australian oil and gas company Woodside Energy has suffered an embarrassing rebuke of its climate credentials after its emissions plan was overwhelmingly rejected by shareholders at its annual general meeting on Wednesday. Investors lodged a 58% vote against Woodside’s climate report, representing the strongest protest recorded against any of the dozens of listed companies around the world that regularly put climate-related resolutions to shareholders. The Woodside chair, Richard Goyder, who survived a push against his own re-election at the AGM, said he was disappointed by the result, which was non-binding. “The board will seriously consider the outcome when reviewing our approach to climate change,” Goyder told shareholders in Perth. “We take the shareholder feedback seriously.” The well-known businessman, who also chairs Qantas and the AFL, was defiant, telling investors that Woodside’s operations were part of the solution to climate change. “The world’s going to be a heck of a lot better off if it moves from coal-fired power to gas-fired power as soon as it can,” he said. The battle over Woodside’s climate plan pitted the country’s biggest oil and gas producer against global and Australian investors increasingly concerned about the energy sector’s contribution to global warming. Critics believe Woodside’s strategy is overly reliant on offsets, not aligned with Paris climate agreements, and does not seriously consider emissions produced by those using its gas. Customer service managers on London Underground are to stage a fresh strike in a dispute over terms and conditions. Members of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) will walk out on Friday and ban overtime until 5 May. The union said the action is likely to cause tube stations to close at the last minute, including into Saturday morning. The workers held a previous strike earlier this month. The TSSA’s general secretary, Maryam Eslamdoust, said: It’s clear that our customer service managers’ strike on 10 April made a real impact, many stations shut at short notice, and we had overwhelming support from the public. Because of London Underground’s refusal to get back round the negotiating table, we have been forced to take further strike action this week. London Underground must now come clean with the public. Their refusal to negotiate seriously and fairly with our union will lead to stations closing at the last minute and other stations being understaffed. We have made it clear that our union will not accept the continued threats to our members’ roles, locations, terms and conditions to stand unchallenged. We will continue to take sustained action until London Underground is prepared to negotiate with us in good faith. The return of optimism in Germany: a third monthly increase in the Ifo index strengthens the view that the German economy has left the trough behind and should be able to enjoy some more cyclical improvement, writes Jeroen van den Broek, global head of sector research at ING. Germany’s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, has added to recent evidence of a bottoming out of the German economy. In April, the Ifo index increased for the third month in a row, to 89.4, from 87.9 in March. Judging from previous experiences, three consecutive increases tend to mark a turning point in the economy. The cycle has started to turn for the better. Today’s Ifo index provides further evidence of a bottoming out of the German economy. Hard data for the first two months of the quarter already suggested that the economy could have left recession behind earlier than expected. Strong activity in the construction sector on the back of mild winter weather, and a technical rebound in trade and industrial production should have offset still weak private consumption. This cyclical upswing looks set to continue in the second quarter… All in all, today’s Ifo index brings back more optimism for the German economy. The cyclical trough is behind us but this doesn’t necessarily mean that a strong recovery is imminent as structural weaknesses remain. A new risk of this cyclical improvement could be that it gives rise to policy complacency. Heathrow is expecting its busiest ever summer holiday season but faces uncertainty over its long-term future as the proposed £6bn sale of the UK’s biggest airport remains in doubt. The airport said on Wednesday that the summer getaway this year was expected to be “the busiest on record” and promised to have “robust” plans in place to keep the airport “running smoothly”, even if staff strikes seen last year are repeated. The number of passengers using the airport this year is expected to hit more than 82.4 million. This would make it the busiest year on record, and above the previous high in 2019, when 80.9 million travelled through the airport. Heathrow’s future is in the balance amid reports that a proposed deal to buy the airport from the Spanish construction company Ferrovial is on hold after Macquarie ruled out taking a stake. Dutch and British wholesale gas prices have climbed, as planned and unplanned outages in Norway and Britain weighed on supply, despite a return to milder temperatures. The benchmark front-month Dutch contract rose 1.7% to €29.01 per megawatt hour, while the British benchmark contract was up 2.5% at 72.75p per therm. The flow of Norwegian gas to Britain fell 26m cubic metres per day compared with yesterday, while unplanned outages in the UK at Bacton Seal and Bacton Perenco cut 8m cubic metres per day of supply, according to Saku Jussila, gas data analyst at the. London Stock Exchange. More Norwegian maintenance on Thursday will cut supplies further. Crude oil prices are little changed now following modest rises earlier. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is trading at $88.43 a barrel, while US light crude is at $83.3 a barrel. However, the wider FTSE 100 index is continuing its rally, and has just hit a new record high of 8090. The bluechip index is on track for its sixth consecutive session of gains, the first such winning streak since August 2023. Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The UK market has demonstrated yet more stamina, with further gains achieved on what has already been a record-breaking week. A slight cooling of Middle Eastern tensions, coupled with broad based corporate earnings optimism are both helping the FTSE. In the US, markets have also continued to rally, based on strong earnings figures from high calibre and closely monitored companies. The large volume of company results this week gives investors a lot more to focus on than purely macro events, which is leading to the extra levels of market vitality. Tesla was one such positive story, after the market responded well to news it’s planning to accelerate the launch of its new models. This will put the brakes on planned cost cutting, but is a way to hopefully boost volumes. In the increasingly competitive space of EVs, Tesla’s must-have status is one element it has above the others. Shares in Gucci owner Kering tumbled 8.2% after the French luxury group warned of sharply lower profits in the first half of this year, as sales at its top brand Gucci slumped. Its UK rival Burberry also took a hit, with its shares down 2.2%, as traders worried about the outlook for the luxury sector. Sales at Gucci, which makes up half of group sales and two thirds of profits, fell 18% on a comparable basis, as demand dried up in its key Chinese market. The new designer Sabato de Sarno’s first collections have recently started arriving in stores and have been well received by customers, Kering said. Sales at Yves Saint Laurent, its second biggest label, fell 6% on a like-for-like basis in first three months of the year, while smaller brands Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen collectively posted a 6% fall in sales. Only the Italian fashion house Bottega Veneta and Kering’s eyewear business bucked the trend, posting sales growth. Kering alerted investors to its troubles last month, while LVMH and Hermès have fared better so far. The global luxury market has slowed in the past year following a multi-year pandemic boom. In Germany, business sentiment has improved more than expected this month. The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate index rose to 89.4 from 87.9 in March, beating analysts’ expectations of a 88.8 reading. The economic situation is stabilising, led by service industries, it added. Adam Vettese, analyst at the investment platform eToro, said: To say Reckitt Benckiser has had a tough year would be a significant understatement with the price plummeting almost a third since February off the back of poor Q4 results and litigation facing their baby formula brand. With that said, many shareholders may well have been bracing for impact this morning but in fact the results offer a timely reprieve. Even when consumers are tightening their belts, Reckitt’s array of consumer staples in well-known brands are still well in demand with consumers even upgrading to premium versions as smaller luxuries take the place of bigger, more extravagant purchases. Sales jumped despite price increases showing strong brand loyalty to the likes of Finish, Dettol and Nurofen and the increase is coming not only from price but volume also. More buybacks are on the way in July and provided legal issues do not bring too much more trouble to the door, investors could see value at the current levels with the price 38% away from its 2024 high which was only at the end of February. The consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser is leading gains on the FTSE 100, after it beat analysts’ forecasts with like-for-like sales growth, boosted by demand for its Lysol, Dettol and Finish cleaning products, despite higher prices. Shares in Reckitt rose more than 4%. Mining shares Rio Tinto and Anglo American are also among the top gainers, with metal prices rising on the back of a weaker US dollar. This helped the FTSE achieve a new record high of above 8083, up nearly 0.5% today. Reckitt’s like-for-like sales in the past three months rose 1.5%, while analysts had expected 0.9% growth. The group also makes Nurofen tablets, the cold remedy Lemsip and Durex condoms. Chief executive Kris Licht said: We continue to benefit from carryover pricing and consumers trading up to our premium innovations. However, uncertainty remains over Reckitt’s potential liability from a US lawsuit about one of its baby formula products, called Enfamil Premature 24. Last month, a court in Illinois awarded $60m in damages to a woman whose premature baby died in intensive care after consuming the Enfamil product; the allegation was that Reckitt failed to warn adequately that feeding with infant formula increased the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Here is our full story on Lloyds: Lloyds Banking Group has posted a 28% drop in profits for the first three months of the year as intense competition in the mortgage and savings market hit its earnings. The country’s largest mortgage lender, which owns the Halifax brand, said pre-tax profits dropped to £1.6bn between January and March, having fallen from £2.3bn last year when rising interest rates boosted the lender’s profits by almost 50%. Pressure from politicians and regulators to pass on interest rates to savers at the same rate they had been raising mortgage and loan charges has squeezed income for major mortgage providers such as Lloyds in recent months. In response, banks have competed harder for customer deposits by offering more substantial returns, particularly on fixed savings products where consumers lock away cash for longer. Customer deposits fell by about £2.2bn to £469.2bn. Just after the open, the FTSE 100 index hit a fresh record high, rising to 8083. It is now trading at 8076, up 0.4%. Shares have been lifted by hopes of interest rate cuts and easing geopolitical tensions. Asian and US stocks have also rallied, cheered by strong corporate results. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK’s media regulator has warned broadcasters to maintain due impartiality ahead of the general election later this year. Ofcom also published new strengthened rules on using politicians as presenters following repeated breaches of its guidance, but stopped short of an outright ban, saying this is not what people want. Cristina Nicolotti Squires, Ofcom’s broadcasting and media group director, said: People are clear that they expect broadcasters to maintain the highest standards of due impartiality. It follows that, given politicians’ partial viewpoint, audiences don’t want to see or listen to politicians presenting news – full stop. But while many are instinctively uncomfortable with politicians presenting current affairs, there was no clear consensus for an outright ban. Lloyds Banking Group, which owns Halifax, has kicked off the UK bank earnings season, reporting a 28% drop in first-quarter pre-tax profits to £1.6bn. Peaking interest rates and growing competition in the mortgage market squeezed margins. FTSE 100 futures point to the index hitting another all-time high when markets open. The FTSE 100 index finished Tuesday at a new closing high, for the second day running, up 0.26% at 8044 points. During the day, it hit a new record high of 8076 points, as hopes of interest rate cuts pushed shares higher. However, the Bank of England’s chief economist Huw Pill said later on that inflation must be squeezed out of the economy and cautioned against cutting rates too soon. Asian stocks have rallied, led by tech stocks after Tesla, the US electric carmaker, surged in after-hours trading following its promise of new models. Japan’s Nikkei gained 2.3%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 2.1% and the Singapore exchange added 0.8%. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.6%. US stocks closed higher after companies such as General Motors reported strong results. The Nasdaq finished 1.6% higher while the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%. Tesla kicked off the earnings season for the US tech giants, known as the Magnificent 7, which last week had close to $1 trillion wiped off their combined market value in a boon to short sellers. Tesla shares surged nearly 10% in after-hours trading, despite a revenue miss for the first quarter of 2024, a steep decline in profits, and a recall of its most recently released car, the $100,000 Cybertruck. However, investors were cheered by previews of a ride-hailing app to be integrated into Tesla products, and the company’s promise to release new vehicle models sooner than previously announced (it referenced a robotaxi network in the works).

        "content": "The share of Great Britain’s electricity generated by burning fossil fuels plummeted to unprecedented lows this month, ahead of plans to begin running a “zero-carbon grid” for short periods from next year. Electricity generated by burning gas and coal fell to a record low of just 2.4% for an hour at lunchtime on Monday 15 April, according to an analysis of data from National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO). The same data has revealed that earlier this month the share of fossil fuels in the generation mix taken over an entire day fell to a record low of 6.4%, on 5 April. The findings lend support to the aims of the ESO to begin the “groundbreaking and world-leading” step of running a zero-carbon electricity grid for Great Britain for short periods from next year. Craig Dyke, the director of system operations at the ESO, said Britain had made “excellent progress” towards this goal and there had already been periods when the grid had run safely on more than 90% zero-carbon power. The new records mark a dramatic shift from 15 years ago, when gas and coal power plants made up 75% of the electricity mix, while renewables accounted for only 2%. Last year only a third of Great Britain’s electricity came from fossil fuels, compared with 40% from renewables. The research, undertaken by Carbon Brief, found a dramatic increase in the frequency of short periods when fossil fuels made up less than 5% of Great Britain’s electricity generation in recent months. There have been 75 half-hour periods in the year to date when fossil fuels have accounted for less than 5% of the country’s electricity needs, more than four times the number recorded last year. Just five ultra-low carbon half hours were recorded in 2022, the analysis said. The new record low took place amid a glut of renewable energy, according to the ESO. At the time, wind power made up about half of electricity generation while solar power accounted for just over 30%. Britain’s nuclear reactors generated more than 13%. The low-carbon generation squeezed gas-fired power to just 1.8% of Great Britain’s electricity generation while the country’s last remaining coal power plant, at Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, generated 0.6%. The plant is due to close in September. Dyke said: “This is a culmination of a significant amount of effort over a number of years. It’s not just about technologies, it’s about hearts and minds and processes and systems and people working together across the industry, the energy regulator and government. “Getting to the 2025 ambition has been a significant engineering challenge, which we are solving.”",

        "title": "Lloyds profits fall as competition for mortgages heats up",
        "content": "Lloyds Banking Group has suffered a 28% drop in first-quarter profits amid tough competition for mortgages and savings, but bosses said they expected those pressures to soon ease, helped by an improving UK economy. The country’s largest mortgage lender, which also owns the Halifax brand, said pre-tax profits dropped to £1.6bn between January and March, having fallen from £2.3bn last year when rising interest rates boosted the lender’s profits by almost 50%. The bank’s chief financial officer, William Chalmers, said this reflected “keen pricing in the mortgage markets, and savings moving into higher rate accounts”. Competition and jitters in the mortgage market led to a drop in its total outstanding loan book. It resulted in a 10% drop in net interest income, which accounts for the difference in loan charges versus what is paid out to savers, to £3.2bn in the three months to March. Pressure from politicians and regulators to pass on interest rates to savers at the same rate they had been raising mortgage and loan charges has squeezed income for major mortgage providers such as Lloyds in recent months. In response, banks have had to compete harder for customer deposits by offering more substantial returns, particularly on fixed savings products where consumers lock away cash for longer. It attracted £1.3bn in regular customer deposits but that failed to make up for the £3.5bn pulled by business clients. However, Chalmers said these savings and mortgage pressures were likely to “ease through 2024”, as economic conditions continued to improve. House prices, which Lloyds previously expected to fall by 2.2% in 2024, are forecast to rise by 1.5% by the end of the year. The banking group, often seen as a bellwether for the UK economy, is also forecasting a steady improvement in economic growth, at a rate of 0.3% in most quarters and a drop in inflation to 2.4% – from 3.2% in March – resulting in a fall in interest rates to 4.5% by December. It expects the Bank of England to cut rates three times in 2024, starting in the middle of the year. Chalmers said mortgage applications had already soared by 20% in the first quarter, which could translate into new home loans, and reverse some of its loan book losses. That partly reflected the group’s willingness to offer better interest rates in order to boost lending. “We’re really pleased to see the pickup in applications, and development of our market share, in that respect. And I think that represents what is a series of competitive offers out there in the market, suiting our customer needs. We’d hope to maintain that ambition over the course of the year,” Chalmers said. Overall, the banking boss said he expected the UK mortgage market to pick up by 5% by the end of 2024. “We’d hope to play a major part in it,” Chalmers added. The improved economic outlook meant the bank was more confident that customers could repay their loans. Despite the cost of living crisis and higher mortgage repayments, which have weighed on borrowers, Lloyds set aside £57m for potential defaults, compared with £243m last year. The Lloyds chief executive, Charlie Nunn, said: “The group is continuing to deliver in line with expectations in the first quarter of 2024, with solid net income, cost discipline and strong asset quality. Our performance provides us with further confidence around our strategic ambitions and 2024 and 2026 guidance.” Investors had also been hoping for updates on the Financial Conduct Authority investigation into whether consumers have been charged inflated prices for car loans. Lloyds, which has the largest car loan division of the four biggest UK banks, has already put aside £450m – far short of the £2bn that analysts believe it could be on the hook for. However, Lloyds did not give any more details about whether it might put aside more cash to cover potential fines or compensation for customers. The FCA has indicated that it will give more details on its findings by the autumn.",

        "title": "UK bankers warned of ‘severe losses’ if they fail to monitor private equity exposures",
        "content": "UK banks are leaving themselves open to “severe, unexpected losses”, by failing to properly measure how exposed they are to the $8tn private equity industry, the Bank of England has warned. In a speech on Tuesday, Rebecca Jackson, a senior executive at the central bank, said there was a “creeping sense of complacency” among lenders, who – despite a boom in loans and financing to the sector – had almost no ability to put together data “or even appreciate its crucial importance”. She said the issue was partly due to the fact that banks had not previously been exposed to a private equity downturn. Under the private equity model, large sums are borrowed from banks to finance the purchase of businesses, with profits from those businesses then relied on to make interest payments on the loans. It means banks could be accruing huge and unintentional exposures to the private equity industry, which would be unable to immediately sell assets to pay down loans in a crisis. “It’s not difficult to imagine a scenario, such as malpractice at a financial sponsor or the bankruptcy of multiple portfolio companies, where risk correlations increase significantly and liquidity evaporates, leaving banks open to severe, unexpected losses,” Jackson said in a speech to the City lobby group UK Finance on Tuesday. “This is a systemic risk too.” The amount of assets managed by private equity businesses globally has grown at a rate of aabout 13% a year, Jackson explained, rising from $2tn (£1.6tn) dollars in 2012 to about $8tn last year. Individual funds have grown exponentially too, with the largest fund – run by the private equity business CVC – having set a record by raising $29bn last summer. Back in 2006, the record for fundraising stood at $15.6bn, Jackson explained. The Bank of England said it was running out of patience, having raised similar concerns about the exposure of banks to risky loans after the collapse of the hedge fund Archegos – which left big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse nursing more than $10bn in losses – as well as the bond market crisis that followed the disastrous mini-budget led by the former prime minster Liz Truss in 2022. “The risk of outsized, illiquid, and unintentionally concentrated exposures is something that we have been pointing out for some time now, and for which we have very little patience,” Jackson said. The Bank of England has written to executives, giving UK lenders four months to get a handle on their dealings with private equity businesses, saying they will have to report back to the regulator by 30 August. “The need for significant improvements in risk management is clear, and it’s clear that these need to happen now. It’s better, as Shakespeare said, to be three hours too soon than a minute too late,” Jackson said.",

        "title": "Post Office boss ‘obsessed with his pay’, claims former HR director",
        "content": "The chief executive of the Post Office was “obsessed” with his pay and threatened to resign unless it was increased even as the Horizon scandal escalated, a former HR director at the postal service has claimed. The former chief people officer, Jane Davies, said Nick Read repeatedly demanded pay increases from the government, the company’s sole shareholder, and described his bonus as “intolerable”. Davies has previously accused Read of bullying, an allegation of which he was cleared in an external report published earlier this month. But on Tuesday, the business select committee published a lengthy letter from Davies in which she further addressed her relationship with Read, who she said blamed her for failing to help him secure improved terms. Davies told MPs that Read repeatedly threatened to resign over his pay deal, which she claimed “dominated” her first eight weeks at the Post Office after she joined in December 2022, in the middle of a judge-led inquiry into the Horizon scandal. Davies described more than 30 emails and instant messages in December 2022 and January 2023 discussing Read’s growing disgruntlement over his remuneration. The issue became a “huge distraction” from her duties, Davies claimed, which included efforts to secure compensation for victims of the Horizon scandal, widely seen as one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British history. Post Office annual reports show that Read has earned £2.28m in the four years since 2020, his first full year in office, of which £1.68m was basic salary. The remaining £600,000 came from performance-related extras, including a £455,000 bonus for 2021-22. In a business select committee session about the Horizon scandal in June 2023, Read said he was “very conscious that I am very well paid”. The alleged exchanges took place as post office operators, hundreds of whom were wrongfully convicted of crimes such as fraud and theft due to the flawed Horizon IT system, were still battling for compensation. According to Davies, Read wrote in an email on 16 December 2022 that his “bonus situation is intolerable”. The Post Office annual report shows that he was paid £137,000 in bonuses for the year 2022-23. In the same email he allegedly asked: “Can the business afford to be rudderless”? Davies also claimed that in December 2022, Read came into the office of the Post Office’s recently appointed chair, Henry Staunton, and threatened to immediately resign unless Staunton could “appease” him with an incentive to stay. Staunton was initially supportive of Read, Davies claims, taking the request for higher pay to the government, which is the sole shareholder in the Post Office. The request met with “short shrift”, she said, adding that Read had previously threatened to resign unless the government lifted a freeze on his pay twice in the previous year. “Nick had cried wolf at least three times,” she claims a board member told her. After Davies prepared a new pay proposal to ministers, Read allegedly remained unhappy, saying: “I am prepared to submit a formal grievance and or make a claim for constructive dismissal.” Davies alleged the pay feud with the government continued but that Staunton eventually told Read he would get a 5% salary increase from £415,000 to £436,000 in 2023, as well as an agreement that the previous year’s bonus did not need to be repaid. She did not explain why the bonus might have been repaid. She also claimed that Read had previously recalculated the methodology used to calculate his bonus, resulting in an inflated bonus being paid that had not been rubber-stamped by the government. Other executives referred to this as an “unauthorised” bonus and were unhappy about it, she claimed. She said this demonstrated “a pattern of behaviour, which was centred on maximising his own pay, not erring on the side of caution and not taking into consideration the wide inequalities of pay in [the Post Office]”. A Post Office spokesperson said: “Just last week a highly reputable barrister produced an extensive, robust, and impartial report that fully exonerated Nick Read of all the misconduct allegations levelled against him, and in so doing discredited many of the claims raised in these letters. “For the avoidance of doubt the barrister was fully empowered to investigate and conclude as she saw fit. Our focus remains on providing redress for postmasters; learning from the grievous errors of the past; and building an organisation able to meet the challenges of the future.” The company did not directly address Davies’ allegations about Read’s pay.",

        "title": "Kingsmill owner warns of price rises due to ‘very small’ expected harvests in UK",
        "content": "One of the UK’s biggest bread makers has warned of potentially higher prices as it expects “very small” grain harvests in the UK, making the company more reliant on imports. George Weston, the head of Associated British Foods (ABF), which owns Kingsmill and Ryvita as well as Twinings tea, Dorset Cereals and the cut-price fashion retailer Primark, said the group had not increased its food prices in the past six months after a hefty period of inflation last year. However, he added: “One to watch out for is UK cereal. The harvest in July and August may be very small and we may be importing quite a lot of grain to the UK and that will come at a cost.” He said the rise in cost of UK grains such as wheat might be offset by larger harvests elsewhere in the world but that was not yet clear. “We are not planning to put prices up at this stage but commodities and other input costs may go up more than we anticipate,” he said. “The situation, if not benign, is more settled than it’s been for a while.” Record rainfall has meant farmers in many parts of the UK have been unable to plant crops such as potatoes, wheat and vegetables during the key spring season. Many winter and spring crops that have been planted, including oilseed rape, are of poor quality, with some rotting in the ground. Weston’s comments came as MPs warned of a “perfect storm brewing” on cooking oil. Prices are expected to rise due to the drop in production of oilseed rape in the UK, which has come alongside poor harvests in southern Europe and the continuing effect of war on sunflower crops in Ukraine. Robert Goodwill, chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee, told a hearing on Tuesday: “A perfect storm is brewing on vegetable oil and oil supplies.” He warned many were predicting that oilseed rape production could “disappear from our fields”. UK yields of oilseed rape, which is used to make domestic and commercial cooking oil, are projected to be as much as 38% lower this year compared with 2023 and as much as 54% down on the average yield since 2015, according to analysis from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. Weston also said he was not expecting prices to drop on clothing, despite a drop in the cost of core materials such as cotton as well as shipping fees and production costs. Weston said higher costs of labour in the UK, where the minimum legal wage rose this month, and issues such as business rates were offsetting savings elsewhere. The company is also rebuilding its profit margins after a slide in recent years, when costs rose and it kept prices down during the cost of living crisis and the pandemic. Weston said margins had returned to pre-Covid levels and added that Primark would “remain the most competitive retailer” in the fashion market. He made the comment as ABF revealed a 37% rise in pre-tax profits to £881m in the six months to 2 March as sales rose 2% to £9.7bn.",

        "title": "Bank of England’s chief economist dampens hopes of summer interest rates cut",
        "content": "The prospects of a summer cut in UK interest rates have receded after the Bank of England’s chief economist said inflation must be squeezed out of the economy and cautioned against cutting too soon. After a key survey signalled strong sales across the private sector over the past month and the London stock market rose to a record high, Huw Pill said concerns remained that inflation, which is expected to fall below its 2% target within a few months, could then rebound as the economy strengthens. Speaking in London, Pill said: “We still have a reasonable way to go before I am convinced that the persistent momentum in underlying inflation has stabilised at rates consistent with achievement of the 2% inflation target on a sustainable basis.” He added: “[It] is necessary to squeeze the persistent component [of inflation] out of the system. After his speech financial markets pushed back expectations that the Bank would start cutting interest rates in September. Earlier in the day, investors were betting on a first cut in August from 5.25%. His comments came as a closely watched survey of business activity by S&amp;P Global showed a strong performance by the services sector and a rise in job hiring, in signs that businesses were heading into the summer in a buoyant mood. The flash UK purchasing managers’ index (PMI), which covers the services and manufacturing sectors, rose to 54 in April, up from 52.8 in the previous month. A figure above 50 indicates a period of expansion. Pill’s warning over inflation came soon after the FTSE 100 hit a record high of 8,076 points, driven by hopes that the UK will cut rates sooner than the US, and relief that the Middle East crisis has not escalated further. But Pill’s warning that rate cuts could be delayed deflated some of that stock market exuberance, sending the London market back down to close at 8,044 points. Jonathan Haskel, who sits with Pill on the Bank’s nine-strong monetary policy committee, indicated at a separate event in London on Tuesday that the recovery under way in the UK could delay the first interest rate cut by the central bank. Taking a tough stance that contrasted with several other bank officials, Haskel said more weakness in Britain’s labour market was needed to be confident that inflation would stay at 2%. “The labour market is central to the inflation aspect,” Haskel said at a seminar at City University of London’s Bayes Business School when asked if he now thought it possible inflation would hold at 2% rather than rise later this year. He said the number of job vacancies had fallen while unemployment had increased, showing that the labour market was weakening, but it was unclear if it was weakening quickly enough to keep inflation on target. “Reasonable people might reasonably disagree about the risks,” Haskel said. Last week the deputy governor, Sir Dave Ramsden, said he thought inflation may stay close to 2%. It is now at 3.2%. The rise in private sector activity above estimates by City economists is a double-edged sword for the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, who would like to see interest rates coming down in an election year. Hunt will be disappointed if only modest growth is considered by the Bank of England to be inflationary and means interest rates fall only modestly this year. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said the UK recession in the second half of last year was being left behind, though growth remained modest. “Early PMI survey data for April indicate that the UK economy’s recovery from recession last year continued to gain momentum,” he added. “Improved growth in the service sector offset a renewed downturn in manufacturing to propel overall business growth to the fastest for nearly a year, indicating that gross domestic product (GDP) is rising at a quarterly rate of 0.4% after a 0.3% gain in the first quarter.” Official figures next month covering GDP from January to March are expected to confirm the UK is no longer in recession. Initial estimates showed the economy shrank slightly in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, indicating a shallow technical recession. S&amp;P surveys of business activity across the eurozone also gave encouraging economic signals of a broad recovery. Germany returned to growth in April and France came close to ending a period of contraction, while most other economies in the 20-member bloc grew strongly, giving the biggest boost to growth for almost a year. The HCOB Flash eurozone composite PMI output index was at an 11-month high of 51.4, up from March’s 50.3, a level that indicates faster growth.",

        "title": "FTSE 100 hits record closing high again, despite BoE chief economist warning against cutting interest rates too soon – as it happened",
        "content": "A quick PS….. Neil Shah, Director at Edison Group, suggests some investor may question the wisdom of the Bank of England’s approach to interest rate policy: “Today’s remarks from Huw Pill seem to confirm what we already know: that the Bank of England does not want to be the first major economy to take the plunge on interest rates, and intends to march more or less in lockstep with The Fed – which is expected to adjust rates no earlier than June. Observers may question the ultimate wisdom of this approach. UK inflation has recently dropped to its lowest levels in two and a half years, and we learn just today that grocery inflation has fallen to a 30-month low. Switzerland cut its rates back in March, hoping to stimulate growth. The desire for monetary discipline is certainly understandable, but with the World Bank’s recent warning that the UK’s economy is stagnating, there are now signs that Threadneedle Street’s policy is going into diminishing returns.” After the second closing highs in a row on the London stock market, and a new intraday high this morning, it’s time to wrap up. Here’s today’s main stories, first on the FTSE 100’s big day: And here’s the rest of today’s news: Every dog will have its day and here comes the FTSE 100 index, not so much soaring as limping to a record high of 8,076 today. If that sounds too grumpy, consider that the previous record, 8,047, was set in February last year. In the 14 months it has taken the UK’s premier index to regain its old record level, the S&amp;P 500 index in the US has marched upwards by 22% – and done so in a straight line, more or less, until a slip in the past fortnight. Also note that the Footsie’s latest push above 8,000 carries a heavy flavour of currency effects at work. The US dollar has been strengthening against most major currencies, including sterling, as markets look at the persistence of inflation in the US and judge that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates this year (and could even raise them). Since 75% of the aggregate earnings of Footsie companies are made in foreign currencies, primarily the US dollar, there is a simple beneficial conversion effect when those profits are expressed in pounds and pence. Rises in the sterling-denominated share prices of Shell and BP, two big dollar earners, account for half of the Footsie’s gains this year. More here…. Newsflash: The UK’s blue-chip stock index has ended the day at a new closing high, for the second day running. The FTSE 100 has closed at 8044 points tonight, up 21 points or 0.26% on last night’s closing high. That’s still some way short of the new intraday record high of 8076 points which the Footsie scaled in early trading this morning, as hopes of rate cuts pushed shares higher. Stocks have slipped back after Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill indicated that he thinks the first cut in UK interest rates is still a way off. Retailers were the top risers today, with Primark owner Associated British Foods surging almost 9% today, followed by Ocado (+5.4%) and JD Sports (+3.75%). Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says the FTSE has fought back after being the wall flower of global stock markets during the Q1 market rally. Brooks explains: This is a momentous occasion for the UK index, but the outperformance has been building for the past month. As market volatility has risen, the FTSE 100’s defensive qualities have boosted its attractiveness. It is higher by 1.6% in the past month, even though the S&amp;P 500 has been down by 4.27% in the last four weeks. However, when you adjust for currency effects, the FTSE 100 is lower by 0.66% in the past month. Thus, the performance of the FTSE 100 depends on what currency you are looking at. In sterling terms it is at a record high, in US dollar-adjusted terms its performance is weaker because of the underperformance of sterling vs, the USD in the long term, as you can see in the chart below. Thus, the FTSE 100 may be lagging its peers because US investors are not so interested in the UK index when returns are lower in USD. Today’s speech by Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill shows his view about the path of UK interest rate rises hasn’t changed, says Shweta Singh, chief economist at Cardano. This likely reflects that the majority of MPC members are still in the ‘on hold’ camp, compared to the dovish shift from deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden last week, says Singh, adding: Having said that, Pill has left some room for interpretation: it seems he has an end point in mind for the start of the rate cut cycle, and since his last speech in early March we are now closer to that timeline. UK banks need to improve their risk management frameworks so they can access the risks from private equity, the Bank of England has warned. The BoE has written to chief risk officers at UK banks, giving them until the end of August to benchmark their risk management frameworks, and devise a plan to fix any gaps. This follows a review by the Bank’s Prudential Regulatory Authority, which found that “very few” banks carry out “routine, bespoke and comprehensive stress testing” of their exposure to private equity firms. That is a concern for the Bank, as the private equity market – which is highly leveraged – has grown considerably over the past decade. Banks’ exposures to the sector have also grown considerably, by offering them a range of financial products. Rebecca Jackson, executive director for Authorisations, Regulatory Technology &amp; International Supervision at the Bank, says firms need to improve their risk management swiftly. In a speech to UK Finance this afternon, Jackson explains: The strong growth and attractive return profile of private equity over the last 10 years has emerged during a period of relatively benign market, economic and liquidity conditions for the sector. Though the economy has seen some major bumps in the road, particularly during covid, we have avoided extended market and economic downturns. While of course this is a very good thing, it does mean that the sector remains untested. Yet the trends that this review has identified; of creeping leverage, large exposures, complicated structures, and poor risk aggregation, all suggest that banks may not be prepared for such a test, if or when it emerges. And there is the broader and longer-term question of whether developments in the industry constitute a ‘displacement’ – a change in the macro environment or ‘technology’ of Banking, that would be a necessary albeit not sufficient condition for more systemic issues to emerge. In any event, the need for significant improvements in risk management is clear, and it’s clear that these need to happen now; it’s better, as Shakespeare said, to be 3 hours too soon than a minute too late. Today’s weak US PMI data is giving the pound a lift. Sterling is now up a whole cent, or 0.8%, today at $1.245, as the dollar weakens on the back of warnings that the US recovery is losing momentum. Despite going off the boil after its early surge, the FTSE 100 could notch up its second closing high in a row tonight. With an hour’s trading to go, the blue-chip share index is up 0.15% today at 8036 points, which is 12 points higher than last night’s closing high. Just in: Sales of new homes in the US bounced back last month. Despite the pressure from higher mortgage rates, sales of new single-family home sales increased by 8.8% to an annual rate of 693,000 in March. Newsflash: growth across the US private sector has slowed this month, amid signs that demand is weakening as firms cut staff. That’s according to the latest survey of purchasing managers at American companies, from S&amp;P Global. The flash US PMI composite output index, which tracks activity across US companies, has dropped to a four-month low of 50.9 this month, down from 52.1 in March. That takes it close to the 50-point mark showing stagnation. The PMI report shows that firms suffered a drop in new orders for the first time in six months in April. Firms scaled back employment for the first time in almost four years, with business confidence falling to its lowest since last November. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says: “The US economic upturn lost momentum at the start of the second quarter, with the flash PMI survey respondents reporting below-trend business activity growth in April. Further pace may be lost in the coming months, as April saw inflows of new business fall for the first time in six months and firms’ future output expectations slipped to a five-month low amid heightened concern about the outlook. The more challenging business environment prompted companies to cut payroll numbers at a rate not seen since the global financial crisis if the early pandemic lockdown months are excluded. That might dampen speculation that the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates even higher…. NatWest bosses were blessed with a snappy sub-one hour AGM this morning (likely helped by Nigel Farage only throwing criticism via social media [see earlier post], rather than in Edinburgh). But its new chairman, Rick Haythornthwaite, was pushed to weigh in on the planned sell-off of the government’s remaining 28.9% stake. It comes ahead of a much-trailed plan to sell NatWest shares to the public later this summer, with a ‘Tell Sid’-style campaign. The chairman told shareholders on Tuesday, that once NatWest was fully privatised, it would end a “sorry tale” for taxpayers and the banking group (which was bailed out with £46bn of taxpayer cash in 2008, when it was still known as Royal Bank of Scotland). Haythornthwaite explained: “I think there’s a perception there is more intervention from His Majesty’s Treasury than there actually is. I think removing that overhang is of value. It also brings to an end what is a sorry tale for the UK and a sorry tale for the bank.” Meanwhile, Haythornthwaite also revealed that NatWest had launched an AI review, that identified where they could automate work across the banking group. “With the use of artificial intelligence, there are material opportunities to pursue further customer benefits and increase efficiency. A bank wide exercise in 2023 identified over 100 priority use cases for AI to address manual operations processes and wider controls. Ultimately, we want to build a NatWest Group that is simpler and more productive to better serve our customers.” And despite some slight controversy over the CEO’s salary (for being set at the same level as his predecessor Alison Rose), all of the company’s resolutions, including those regarding pay, passed with flying colours. Swedish streaming service Spotify is having a good day, after reporting record income in the last quarter. Shares in Spotify have jumped by 14% at the start of trading on Wall Street, after it reported record high operating income of €168m in the last quarter. Spotify, which announced 1,500 job cuts at the end of last year, reported today that monthly active users grew 19% year-on-year to 615 million, in the first quarter of this year Subscribers increasing by 14% year-on-year to 239 million, while total revenue rose 20% compared with a year before. Daniel Ek, Spotify founder &amp; CEO, says: “We’ve talked about 2024 as the year of monetization and we’re delivering on that ambition. Now as we’ve shifted to focus on strong revenue growth and margin expansion, we see a clear opportunity to ensure we are also continuing to grow the top of our funnel. I feel good about the changes we are implementing and remain very confident in our ability to reach the ambitious plans we’ve outlined.” Over in the US, automaker General Motors and soft drinks and snacks firm PepsiCo have both beaten expectations. GM has cheered Wall Street by raising its forecast for adjusted pre-tax profits this year, to $12.5bn-$14.5bn, up from a previous target of $12bn-$14bn. GM chief financial officer Paul Jacobson said: “Our consumer has been remarkably resilient in this period of higher interest rates.” PepsiCo, though, reported a slowdown in the US, where it recently recalled some granola products following concern over potentially deadly salmonella contamination. But it still beat revenue and profit expectations, as demand for its sodas and snacks like Cheetos and Doritos in international markets drove growth. Adam Vettese, analyst at investment platform eToro, says: “Pepsico has delivered a solid set of results today given the backdrop of high inflation and the recall of its Quaker cereal products around the turn of the year tied to potential salmonella contamination. That issue saw volumes plunge 22% at its Quaker Foods division. While Pepsi has already confirmed the closure of the factory at the centre of that problem, some question marks may remain for investors over the size of further fallout before operations normalise. Shares in the company were little changed in pre-market trading.” Why has Huw Pill’s comments today moved the markets, when the BoE’s chief economist was at pains to point out that little has changed since his previous speech at the start of March? Well, the probem is that while Pill claims there has been “little relevant news” to change his views, other policymakers may not agree. Last Friday, deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden declared that “the balance of domestic risks to the outlook for UK inflation” had “tilted to the downside” since the Bank last drew up its forecasts in February. Ramsden’s suggestion that inflation could stay close to 2% target over the next three years was taken as a sign that the Bank was moving closer to its first rate cut in the current cycle. Pill did concede that the first rate cut was closer than in March, but that’s due to time’s winged chariot rattling along, rather than changes in the outlook for monetary policy. Huw Pill appears to have driven the FTSE 100 away from its new alltime high! The blue-chip share index has now shed all its earlier gains, and is now flat at 8023 points, where it closed last night. That wipes out all the earlier rally that pushed the Footsie to a new intraday high of 8076 points early this morning. The FTSE 100 is sliding as the pound strengthens by half a cent, back to $1.24. That is hitting the share price of mining giants listed in London, as they make their earnings in dollars. The BoE chief economist seems to have done the damage, by arguing this lunchtime that conditions haven’t changed in the last few weeks. That is dampening hopes of early interest rate cuts, as is Huw Pill’s warning that it would be riskier to cut too early than too late. Investors are responding to Huw Pill’s speech by trimming their expectations for interest rate cuts. Although two cuts this year are still priced in, the odds of an August cut are slipping slightly. The first cut is now only fully priced in for September. Huw Pill went on to cite today’s PMI survey to support his view that the UK economy has returned to growth, saying: “Economic growth in the UK has resumed, albeit at a modest rate, over the past few months following the technical recession we experienced in the second half of last year. And today’s survey data … certainly supports that view. Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill predicts that inflation is likely to fall to the Bank’s 2% target, or even lower, in the coming months. But, he also tells his audience in London that the rate of inflation could bounce back up again. So we shouldn’t get too excited if CPI falls to 2% or lower, he argues. He also warns that it could be riskier to cut interest rates too soon, rather than leaving borrowing costs high for too long. As Pill puts it: In my view there are greater risks associated with easing too early should inflation persist rather than easing too late should inflation abate. Newsflash: The Bank of England’s chief economist, Huw Pill, is speaking in London now. And he says that the first cut in UK interest rates is “somewhat closer” than at his last speech, at the start of March… but mainly due to the passage of time since! Pill begins by telling his audience at the London campus of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business that he doesn’t believe much has changed since his last speech, on 1st March, when he said the BoE was “some way off” cutting interest rates. Today, Pill argues that the picture has changed little in the seven weeks since. He says: In my view, against the background of a welcome decline in headline inflation, the outlook for UK monetary policy in the coming quarters has not changed substantially since the beginning of March. Pill outlines how events in the Middle East are a reminder of potential external risks (although they haven’t yet had a major impact on energy prices), while the UK’s inflation rate dipped in March, as expected. Pill explains that the Bank’s monetary policy committee needs to keep policy sufficiently restrictive to ensure inflation falls to 2% and stays there. But, he add, a cut in Bank Rate from current levels would not entirely undo the restrictive stance of policy. And in conclusion, Pill hammers home his message that a “lack of news” means little has changed between St. David’s Day (1st March) and St. George’s Day (today). Against a welcome backdrop of declining headline inflation anticipated by the MPC, the flow of conjunctural data since I last spoke on the monetary policy stance in Cardiff in early March has offered modest relevant news. This suggests little need to amend the assessment of the economic, inflation and policy outlook that I offered then. In Cardiff, I concluded that, while we are making satisfactory progress in returning inflation to target, in my baseline scenario the time for cutting Bank Rate remained some way off. That justified my vote to keep Bank Rate unchanged at the MPC’s February meeting and underpinned my subsequent decision to vote similarly in March. The combination of little news and the passage of time have brought a Bank Rate cut somewhat closer. But the same lack of news gives me no reason to depart from the baseline that I already established on St. David’s Day. Although the FTSE 100 is at a new peak, it’s rising slightly slower than other major markets today. Currently the FTSE 100 is up 0.5% today, or 43 points higher at 8067 (slightly below this morning’s new intraday high of 8076 points). In contrast, Germany’s DAX has gained 1%, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 is up 0.9%. Both indices have hit their own record highs earlier this year. The FTSE 100 remains one of the slowest-rising European indices this year (up around 4% this year), having also been one of the laggards in 2023. Motorists have been hit by a jump in fuel costs, the AA has warned, with petrol across the UK now averages above 150p a litre for the first time since November. Data collated by website Fuel Prices Online shows typical pump prices reached 150.1p per litre yesterday. The average price of a litre of diesel is also at the highest level since November 2023, at 158.3p. Luke Bosdet, the AA’s spokesman on pump prices, says: “Inflation has been heading downwards at quite some speed but petrol’s rebound to 150p a litre leaves a big boulder in the road. Government data shows that for the fourth week petrol prices have been higher than at the same time a year ago. This last happened in February 2023. Five days of falling wholesale costs, with the value of oil coming off the boil, offers hope that pump prices may not get much worse in the short-term. However, road fuel priced above 150p a litre grabs the attention of drivers and will lead some to re-tighten their belts on other spending.” The news is a little less gloomy for UK equities at the moment as London’s blue-chip index hits new records, reports Jason Hollands, managing director of online investment platform Bestinvest, this morning: And it’s high time, as UK equities have endured a long negative narrative around investor outflows, companies switching their listings overseas, and underperformance compared to the more exciting US market. “Some of the move in recent days has been down to an improved monetary outlook for the UK. Global investors now anticipate two rate cuts from the Bank of England this year, as the inflationary environment now looks more benign than it does in the US, where a possible reverse-ferret rate hike is back on the cards at the Fed. Renewed strengthening of the US dollar recently will also have played a helping hand for the FTSE 100, as many of the biggest constituents earn the vast majority of their revenues overseas, and often in dollars, a strong US currency can provide a boost to earnings when they are reported in sterling. Hollands also points out how international investors have fallen out of love with the Footsie over the last two decades: “Twenty years ago, UK equities made up 10.9% of the MCI All Country World Index: now they comprise just 3.3%, having been muscled out largely by burgeoning US equities which have grown their representation from 52% to 64%. While the waning relative fortunes of UK equities in recent years have been down to a myriad of factors, including diminishing allocations by domestic pension funds, one of the main drags on the UK market since 2008 has been its large exposure to financials, which represent over a fifth of the FTSE 100 Index today. Banking shares in particular have remained unloved since the global financial crisis. This, combined with negligible exposure to technology companies, are characteristics that have driven divergent returns between the UK and US-dominated global equity indices. The Bank of England will note that today’s PMI report shows there was “a steep increase” in the costs being incurred by UK companies this month. Average cost burdens across the private sector rose at the fastest rate since May 2023, the PMI report shows, suggesting inflationary pressures are still strong. This increase in input price inflation was overwhelmingly linked to higher staff wages, particularly in the hospitality and leisure sector, after the UK’s minimum wage rose by almost 10% this month. Some companies reported this had an indirect impact on pay awards to other employees, S&amp;P Global says. Chris Williamson, their Chief Business Economist, explains: The upturn encouraged firms to take on workers in increased numbers which, alongside April’s rise in the National Living Wage, drove cost pressures sharply higher. Although selling price inflation cooled slightly, the upturn in costs alongside solid demand suggests firms may seek to raise prices in the coming months. “While the improving economic recovery picture is welcome news, the upward pressure on inflation will add to concerns that a sustainable path to below target inflation has not yet been achieved. Bank of England policymaker Jonathan Haskel does not sound like a man itching to cut interest rates. Speaking at a seminar at City University’s Bayes Business School in London today, Haskel says its important to see more slack in Britain’s labour market to be confident that inflation will stay at 2%. Asked if he now thought it possible inflation would hold at 2% rather than rise later this year, Haskel explained: “The labour market is central to the inflation aspect,” [Reminder, last week BoE deputy governor Dave Ramsden argued that UK inflation could hold around the Bank of England’s 2% target for the next three years, rather than rise back towards 3% as previously expected]. Haskel added that labour market tightness - as measured by the ratio between job vacancies and unemployment - was reducing [data last week showed a drop in job openings, and a rise in the jobless rate]. However, it may not be falling fast enough to keep inflation on target. In a hint towards the different views around the monetary policy committee (MPC) table, Haskel added: “Reasonable people might reasonably disagree about the risks.” Last month Haskel dropped his vote for further interest rate hikes, having been one of the hawks pushing for higher borrowing costs since last autumn. The MPC is next due to set interest rates on 9th May; the money markets indicated there’s an 82% likelihood of no change, and just 18% chance of a cut. The monthly purchasing managers index (PMI) is an closely watched barometer of economic prospects; here’s what economists are saying about today’s UK PMI report, showing a pick-up in growth: Rhys Herbert, senior economist at Lloyds Bank, says: “Today’s figures suggest that the UK’s economic conditions are continuing to improve. It’s encouraging to see Service providers recording the fastest growth for nearly a year, and businesses will be hoping that another slight drop in inflation will have a further positive impact on spending power for both households and businesses. Improving economic activity is telling a relatively optimistic story. While geopolitical tensions may cause some challenges in the months ahead, markets remain optimistic that interest rates have peaked and could begin to fall later this year.” But…Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments, points out that factories struggled: “UK Services PMI data rose more than expected in April to a reading of 54.9, a short term high not seen in almost a year. This reflects the continuing recovery from the slowdown seen in the second half of last year. However, the strong showing in services was in stark contrast to the contraction still seen in the manufacturing sector which continues to struggle with a contractionary reading of 48.7. Companies surveyed reported that prices they charged went up at the slowest pace in a number of years, less due to declining demand but more through competition. This may not be seen as good news for the Bank of England who still isn’t comfortable enough that the inflation dynamics are genuinely shifting, and that consumers are reducing demand.” Overall, the PMIs paint a picture of a recovering economy, says Thomas Pugh, economist at leading audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK. He adds: “The robust increase in the flash S&amp;P/CIPS composite PMI in April to 54.0, the highest since May 2023, suggests that the economy continued to pick up steam after last year’s mini-recession. An acceleration in growth in Q2 would, in theory at least, ease the pressure on the Bank of England (BoE) to cut interest rates. But in reality, with inflation still likely to fall to 2% this month, the labour market rapidly weakening and growth still low, the time for interest rate cuts has come. A delay in rate cuts beyond the summer would risk harming the economic recovery for no material impact on inflation. The FTSE 100 has slipped back from its early morning record high, as the news that Britain’s economy is recovering from recession weighs on shares. While a recovering economy is obviously good for companies, this month’s stronger-than-expected PMI report could make the Bank of England cautious about cutting interest rates quite as quickly as hoped. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, explains: The FTSE 100 has started to reverse back from record highs, after a fresh PMI survey that saw the services sector reading jump into the highest level since May 2023. Crucially, traders are showing signs of concern that this rebound in UK growth could come at a cost, with economy-wide input price inflation rising at the highest level in 11-months. Between strong services sector wage growth, and rising material and transportation costs in the manufacturing sector, we are seeing fears grow over the potential for a more cautious approach from the Bank of England. With markets essentially viewing the June rate decision as a coin-toss, today’s data raises fears that the BoE will instead hold off until August. Nigel Farage is urging the public to boycott the government’s planned sale of NatWest shares until the group released a full report regarding the decision to close his account with its private bank, Coutts, last year. The message came just hours before NatWest is due to hold its AGM at its Gogarburn headquarters in Edinburgh, from 11am today. In a video release on social media platform X on Thursday, Farage said: “No member of the British public should put their money and invest in shares in Natwest while they continue to hide the facts, hide the information, to hide the truth about me. This debanking row is far from over and I still reserve the right to take legal action” Farage said he had put in a fresh subject access request to NatWest, asking for all the information that related to him, from the independent investigation surrounding last summer’s debanking row. They came back with “over 100 pages of documents” that he says were simply copies of a variety of press articles and not the information he was hoping for. The debanking controversy started when Coutts – the NatWest-owned private bank for the ultra-wealthy – planned to shut Farage’s bank accounts, and snowballed after Farage obtained internal documents that showed the bank had concerns over his political views. The scandal escalated when it emerged that CEO Alison Rose had discussed Farage’s case with a BBC journalist. Rose resigned, and was forced to forgo £7.6m in pay from NatWest, although independent lawyers hired by the bank concluded she had made an “an honest mistake” in speaking with the BBC and that concerns over Farage’s political views were not the driving factor in the decision to shut his accounts. The government’s stake in NatWest dates back to the bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland after the 2008 financial crisis. Jeremy Hunt confirmed in March’s budget that the government plans to sell a chunk of shares in NatWest in the summer. The sight of the UK’s FTSE 100 index climbing to a new record high this morning could help to buff up the reputation of the UK stock market. The London stock exchange has taken a battering recently as some major companies have chosen to float on Wall Street instead, such as chip maker ARM. Others, such as building materials group CRH, have chosen to move their listing from London to New York. The FTSE 100 has been tarred as a “Jurassic Park” of an index, due to its lack of fast-growing technology companies. But even if the Footsie is something of a lumbering Brontosaurus, it has still scaled new heights today. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says that Brexit, and political ructions, have also weighed on UK share prices. Today’s positive showing is “exactly what’s needed to help repair the reputation of the UK stock market”. He adds: It’s going to be a slow process but every little helps “The UK has lived in the shadows of the US stock market for the past decade or more, delivering inferior returns on a relative basis as it has lacked the go-go growth stocks highly desired by investors. The FTSE’s low exposure to the technology sector has diminished the index’s appeal and seen investors look elsewhere for ways to turbocharge their portfolio. “Brexit and political uncertainty have also weighed on the index, even though approximately three quarters of its constituents earn money overseas. That’s led to cheap valuations and a mountain of unloved stocks. Investors are finally getting the message that a good chunk of these businesses still have a lot to offer, delivering slow but steady profit growth, and they’re available for a fraction of the price of some of their overseas peers. “The conveyor belt of takeovers continues to trundle along and that has put the spotlight on the market. At the same time, many UK-listed companies are simply getting on with the job at hand, delivering earnings and dividend growth. Investors who take a long-term view are still able to find plenty of opportunities. Newsflash: the UK economy continues to pull away from last year’s recession. The UK’s private sector is expanding at its fastest rate since May 2023, according to a new survey of purchasing managers at UK businesses. Data firm S&amp;P Global’s Flash UK PMI has risen to 54.0 this month, up from March’s 52.8. That’s the highest level since last May, showing a pick-up in growth. The services sector, which makes up about three-quarters of the economy, is driving the growth, while the manufacturing sector is shrinking slightly this month. Services companies reported that output is growing this month, helped by a rise in new orders, leading to a small increase in hiring. The PMI report suggests the economic picture is improving, reports Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. He explains: “Early PMI survey data for April indicate that the UK economy’s recovery from recession last year continued to gain momentum. Improved growth in the service sector offset a renewed downturn in manufacturing to propel overall business growth to the fastest for nearly a year, indicating that GDP is rising at a quarterly rate of 0.4% after a 0.3% gain in the first quarter. We will find out next month whether the UK has officially escaped recession, when the GDP figures for January-March are released. The economy shrank slightly in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, which triggered a shallow technical recession. There are encouraging economic signals from the eurozone this morning, where business activity in the euro area is growing at the fastest rate for nearly a year. The latest survey of eurozone purchasing managers from S&amp;P Global shows that Europe is pulling out of its recent downturn. Germany returned to growth in April and France came close to stabilising, while growth was especially solid outside of the eurozone’s two largest members. This pulled the HCOB Flash Eurozone Composite PMI Output Index up to an 11-month high of 51.4, up from March’s 50.3, a level that shows faster growth. Today’s UK public finance figures (see opening post) shows the “difficult inheritance” that will face the Chancellor after the election, explains the Institute for Fiscal Studies: The London stock market is benefitting from expectations that interest rates will be cut sooner in the UK than in the US. The Financial Times reports this morning that some traders are building up bets that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates higher, as inflationary pressures in America look stubbornly high. Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, explains: With economic growth still lagging many of its G7 peers, the UK has turned this to its strength in the fight against inflation, which last month fell below that of the US and saw Governor Andrew Bailey announce that this data shows the UK is “pretty much on track” with the central bank’s forecasts. “This has led investors to anticipate that rate cuts could arrive in the UK well before the US, weakening sterling by just over 3% against the dollar so far this year, and continuing a long running trend that has seen the pound decline more than 25% against the dollar in the past decade, a period over which the FTSE 100 has delivered only around a quarter of the returns generated by the S&amp;P 500. With the bulk of FTSE 100 company earnings generated internationally, this currency weakening conversely benefits UK-based investors as those earnings have risen in sterling terms, offering some relief in the story of long-term underperformance of the home market relative to Europe and the US. Engineering firm Rolls-Royce have been the top riser on the FTSE 100 so far this year. Its shares are up 37%, as profits have surged as it recovered from the pandemic. Chilean miner Antofagasta has gained 29%, lifted by a rise in the copper price this year. Banks have had a good 2024, with NatWest up 28% since the start of January amd Barclays 25% higher. Defense stocks have also benefitted from war in Ukraine, and the Middle East, with BAE Systems up 20% this year (on top of a 30% jump in 2023). The FTSE 100 soared to its record high today amid a rise in investor confidence, reports financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown. Emma Wall, head of investment analysis and research at Hargreaves Lansdown, says investor confidence has ticked up once again in April in all sectors, but particularly in the UK stock market. Wall points out that UK stocks still look cheap when compared to international markets: The UK market is currently on a considerable discount to developed market peers of around 40%, but features high quality companies with global revenues, good cash reserves, and in many cases well-covered, attractive dividends. The economic picture is not as rosy as in the US, but there is a potential benefit to this if you’re a shareholder, it means that the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates sooner than the Fed across the Pond. This should prove a tailwind to corporates and consumers alike, increasing disposable income for those with mortgage debt, and lessening the load for bond issuers too. It took the FTSE 100 just over 40 years to rise to today’s record high of (currently) 8076 points, from its opening value of 1,000. The index was created by the London Stock Exchange in January 1984, and was designed for the new age of electronic trading and derivative products that was being carved out in the City in the 1980s. My colleague Nils Pratley calculated in January that with dividends reinvested, a £1,000 investment in the Footsie in 1984 was worth £22,550 40 yearss later (it’ll be a bit more today). Here’s Nils’ feature, from January, about the FTSE over the decades: Primark’s owner Associated British Foods is the top riser on the FTSE 100 this morning, up over 7%, helping to push the index to new heights. ABF predicted “significant growth” in profitability this year, and posted a 37% rise in pre-tax profits for the 24 weeks to 2 March, to £881m. It added: We expect Primark to continue to perform well in the second half driven by our store expansion programme and the modest levels of like-for-like growth, as we focus on driving volumes. Other retail stocks are also in the top FTSE 100 risers, including Ocado (+4.1%), JD Sports (+2.2%) and Marks &amp; Spencer (+2%). The FTSE 100 is still climbing… hitting a new alltime high of 8071 points. Boom! The UK’s blue-chip share index has hit a new alltime high. The FTSE 100 has jumped at the start of trading to hit 8068 points, up 43 points or 0.55% this morning. That comfortably clears the previous all-time peak of 8,047 points set in February 2023. This extends yesterday’s rally, when shares were lifted by rising hopes that the Bank of England will cut interest rates twice this year. Markets are also more buoyant as fears about an escalating conflict in the Middle East eased. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank explains: Sentiment was bolstered by the lack of any further escalation in the Middle East. Indeed, yesterday saw Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman say that Israel had received the “necessary response at this stage”. The apparent easing in tensions helped oil prices fall back. The UK also borrowed more than expected in the 11 months leading up to March. ONS has revised its forecast for borrowing in the 11 months to February up by £1.9bn, after raising its estimate for the cost of subsidising low-carbon electricity generators. Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK, points out that UK exchequer benefitted from a surge in revenues from taxing corporations and workers last year. “Preliminary estimates for the 2023-24 financial year showed government borrowing at £120.7 billion. While this was higher than the OBR’s March forecast of £114 billion, it still marked a 5.9% reduction from a year earlier, representing the lowest deficit in four years. “Corporation tax receipts totalled a whopping £102.8 billion, up by 19% relative to previous fiscal year. This reflected an increase in the main rate from 19% to 25%, continued strength in company profits, as well as a boost to banks’ net interest margins resulting from higher interest rates. Elevated pay growth has also supported income tax receipts, which brought in £25 billion more in 2023-24 despite the National Insurance cut which came into force in January. Stelmach also warns that the “goldilocks fiscal outlook” faces a number of risks. The recent repricing in market expectations of fewer interest rate cuts could already add around £6 billion to spending this year. Furthermore, the OBR’s projected cost of the National Insurance cuts – which relies on the assumption of a hefty 200,000 increase in labour supply – could prove an underestimate if participation continues to stall.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Jeremy Hunt’s hopes of being given more scope for large tax cuts later this year have been dealt a blow by the latest borrowing figures, just released. Britain borrowed more than £120bn last year to balance the books; over £6bn more than the independent Office for Budget Responsibility had forecast, but £7.6bn less than the previous year. And that looks to be a blow to Hunt’s ambitions to cut taxes in an autumn fiscal event, as well as pushing up the national debt to the highest since the 1960s. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, says the chancellor appears to have limited ‘headroom’ to cut taxes and still meet his fiscal mandate (to have debt falling as a share of GDP in five year’s time). She explains why Hunt may have limited scope for tax cuts: March’s figures show that public borrowing in 2023/24 came in £6.6bn higher than the OBR predicted only a month ago, casting further doubt on the ability of the government to unveil big tax cuts at another pre-election fiscal event later this year. Gregory adds: Just based on the larger-than-expected 2023/24 budget deficit and the recent shift up in market interest rates, he may have even less fiscal ‘headroom’ (perhaps about £5bn) for tax cuts than the £8.9bn left over in March. It also underlines why the International Monetary Fund was warning against pre-election giveaways last week: The Office for National Statistics has also reported tha in March alone, the UK borrowed £11.9bn to cover the gap between government income and spending – higher than the £10.2bn which economists had expected. ONS deputy director for public sector finances Jessica Barnaby says: “Spending was up about £58 billion, with increased spending on public services and benefits outstripping large reductions in interest payable and energy support scheme costs. But with public sector income up £66 billion, overall, the deficit still fell. “At the end of the financial year, debt remained close to the annual value of the output of the economy, at levels last seen in the early 1960s.” Total tax receipts to HM Revenue and Customs rose by £39.1bn in the last year, to £827.7bn, including a £23.7bn increase in takings from Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs), while business taxes brought in £10.3bn more and VAT raised an extra £9.5bn. Inheritance tax brought in £400m more than the previous year, while stamp taxes raised £4.3bn less. Also coming up today The UK’s stock market could hit a record peak today, after the FTSE 100 finished yesterday’s session at an alltime closing high of 8,023 points. That has left the Footsie tantalisingly close to its intraday peak of 8,047 points, which it reached in February 2023. And in the futures market, the FTSE 100 is currently on track to jump to 8070 points – taking it to a new peak! We’ll find out at 8am….

        "title": "‘Grave challenge’: Blackpool rock makers fear for seaside staple’s future",
        "content": "Blackpool rock, a British seaside institution as traditional as donkey rides on the beach, amusement arcades and fair to middling weather, is facing an existential threat from cheap and inferior Chinese imports, manufacturers have said. Ten rock makers have come together to sign a letter warning of a “grave and immediate challenge to our industry, jeopardising the lives of our employees and the sustainability of our business”. Blackpool rock is facing a crisis like never before, they say. They want it to be given a geographic protection similar to stilton cheese or Cornish pasties. “We have never all agreed on something as much as we have on this,” said David Thorp, who coordinated the letter. “I’ve met directors of other factories I’ve never had contact with before and we are all in agreement – what is happening to us is having a massive effect.” Rock is still a staple at seaside resorts, whether that’s Whitby or Weston-super-Mare. What most people do not realise is that almost all of it comes from Blackpool. “Today I’ve made Southend rock,” said Thorp, one of the vanishingly few people skilled in the art of getting letters through each stick. “Yesterday it was Brighton. A couple of days ago it was Llandudno. But it could be Dymchurch or Skegness.” The Blackpool rock businesses were originally planning to solicit the support of their local MPs but that hit something of “a speed bump”, said Thorp. One MP was Scott Benton, the Tory who was suspended and resigned from parliament over his role in a lobbying scandal. The other is the Fylde MP Mark Menzies, who is quitting following allegations of misusing campaign funds. “I know now why he wasn’t emailing me back,” said Thorp. “There is one factory that’s in the constituency of [the former defence secretary] Ben Wallace, but he is also standing down at the next election.” Thorp said all the Blackpool factories were already having issues with high energy bills and the cost of raw materials, but the big new threat was cheap Chinese imports of rock. “It has had a massive effect on all of our turnover,” he said. “There are some factories working three-day weeks and all of us have had to downsize our staff. Some factories if they don’t have work on a certain week they have to close until they do get an order in. “The problem that we’re having is that our customers aren’t always aware that the rock they are buying is a Chinese imitation.” Thorp said rock was a British institution under threat. There are 10 Blackpool rock manufacturers, which have signed the letter. Fifteen years ago there might have been 30. “Next year it will almost certainly be eight.” Only about 30 people in the UK are skilled enough to put letters through the rock. “We’ve got three of them,” said Thorp whose company, Stanton &amp; Novelty, was set up by his grandfather in 1970. “It is a massively dying art. “I’m well aware that there are much bigger, much more important stories in the news … but not to us. This is the future of our factories.” The letter to parliamentarians asks for support in an application to UK geographical protected food names schemes. “Preserving the heritage and tradition of British confectionary is not only essential for our economy but also for maintaining our cultural identity and pride,” it says. Seaside rock as we know it stems from the 19th century, with “fair rock” sold at fair grounds when sugar was cheap and abundant. Putting letters through the rock is said by some to have been the brainchild of Ben Bullock, an ex-miner from Burnley. Others say it was a man called “Dynamite” Dick Taylor, from Morecambe, we have to thank for it. The recipe is boiled sugar, glucose and water with added colours and flavours which, in recent years, have become increasingly dizzying. A trend for pizza or garlic bread flavour has made way for bubblegum or pick ‘n’ mix. Buying seaside rock is a tradition passed down through generations. “No one goes on holiday to the seaside and doesn’t come back with a stick of rock,” said Thorp.",

        "title": "FTSE 100 hits record high as shares rise amid hopes of interest rate cuts",
        "content": "The UK stock market hit a record high on Tuesday, as shares were lifted by hopes of interest rate cuts and an easing of geopolitical tensions. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks listed in London hit 8,076 points on Tuesday, surpassing a previous high of 8,047 in February 2023. On Monday, it ended at a record closing high of 8,023 points. The FTSE hit its new peak as City investors anticipated two cuts to UK interest rates this year, with the first now fully priced in for August. Last Friday, the Bank of England deputy governor, Sir Dave Ramsden, predicted that UK inflation could be lower than expected over the next three years, and remain close to the Bank’s 2% target. The headline rate of inflation is now 3.2%. the prediction weakened the pound, which fell to its lowest since November this week at about $1.2340, pushing up share prices of multinational companies whose dollar earnings are more valuable in sterling terms. But the FTSE 100 fell back from its intraday high, after Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill indicated on Tuesday that he believed rate cuts were still some way off. The FTSE 100 ended Tuesday at a new record closing high, for the second day running, at 8044 points. Investor confidence has also risen this month, particularly in the UK market, according to the financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown. “The UK market is currently on a considerable discount to developed market peers of about 40%, but features high-quality companies with global revenues, good cash reserves, and in many cases well-covered, attractive dividends,” said Emma Wall, the head of investment analysis and research at Hargreaves Lansdown. “The economic picture is not as rosy as in the US, but there is a potential benefit to this if you’re a shareholder, it means that the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates sooner than the Fed across the Pond.” The top FTSE risers on Tuesday were Primark owner Associated British Foods, up by 9%, JD Sports, up by 6% and Ocado, up by 5%. Sentiment was also bolstered by the lack of any further escalation in the Middle East in recent days, after Israel’s attack on the Iranian city of Isfahan on Friday. “Indeed, yesterday saw Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson say that Israel had received the “necessary response at this stage”,” Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said. The FTSE 100 index has gained about 4% so far this year amid optimism that Britain’s economy has returned to growth in 2024 after dropping into a shallow recession at the end of 2023. That leaves it lagging behind other European indices, with France’s Cac and Germany’s Dax up 6.5% so far this year. The engineering company Rolls-Royce has been the top riser on the FTSE 100 so far this year. Its shares are up by 37%, as profits have surged as it recovered from the pandemic. The Chilean miner Antofagasta has gained 28%, lifted by a rise in the copper price this year. Banks have had a good 2024, with NatWest up by 29% since the start of January and Barclays 25% higher. Defence stocks have risen amid the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and BAE Systems is up by 20% this year (on top of a 30% jump in 2023). The FTSE 100 was launched on 3 January 1984, when it was priced at 1,000 points. It quickly elbowed aside the FT 30 index, the previous barometer of market moves in London. The FTSE 100 now has a market capitalisation of almost £2tn, meaning its 100 constituents – from banks and miners to retailers, airlines and housebuilders – are collectively worth less than Microsoft, which has a market cap of $2.97tn (£2.4tn).",

        "title": "FTSE 100 is an international laggard despite its record high | Nils Pratley",
        "content": "Every dog will have its day and here comes the FTSE 100 index, not so much soaring as limping to a record high of 8,076. If that sounds too grumpy, consider that the previous record, 8,047, was set in February last year. In the 14 months it has taken the UK’s premier index to regain its old record level, the S&amp;P 500 index in the US has marched upwards by 22% – and done so in a straight line, more or less, until a slip in the past fortnight. Also note that the Footsie’s latest push above 8,000 carries a heavy flavour of currency effects at work. The US dollar has been strengthening against most major currencies, including sterling, as markets look at the persistence of inflation in the US and judge that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates this year (and could even raise them). Since 75% of the aggregate earnings of Footsie companies are made in foreign currencies, primarily the US dollar, there is a simple beneficial conversion effect when those profits are expressed in pounds and pence. Rises in the sterling-denominated share prices of Shell and BP, two big dollar earners, account for half of the Footsie’s gains this year. Thus, as ever with indices, remember that they are no more than the sum of their parts. The Footsie is not a symbol of national economic virility; it is just a collection of the 100 largest companies listed in London (weighted by value) and includes more than a few (try the Chilean copper miner Antofagasta or the US hedge fund Pershing Square) that have few real ties here. Even Shell, the biggest company of the lot, makes less than 5% of its profits in the UK. But here’s a more uplifting thought about the Footsie and the UK market: valuations still look remarkably cheap compared with international comparators. When Goldman Sachs’s analysts did the arithmetic earlier this month, the UK market was priced at 11.3 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, which is near the bottom of its range over the past 20 years. The figure compared with 21.4 times for the US market, and 18.6 times if one removes the pumped-up big tech brethren from the calculations. Japan, after a storming recovery for the Nikkei index over the past year, was on 15.7 times forward earnings and Europe on 13.7 times. Does the UK market deserve such a discount? Perhaps, if you believe an over-weight exposure to oil companies, miners and banks is just too boring or too Jurassic. But there is also a fair argument that dullness can be a relative virtue when the geopolitical temperature is high. All those sectors – including most of the banks these days – generate piles of cash for share buy-backs and dividends. And, for the purely domestic element of the UK market, life doesn’t look too bad currently. The top retailers – the likes of Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Next – have all turned in good numbers in recent weeks. The election of a pro-business Labour government holds few fears for investors. And the spate of US-led takeovers for FTSE 250 companies – think the logistics firm Wincanton and the building products supplier Tyman – suggests historic low valuations in parts of the UK market are being noticed abroad. None of which guarantees that the Footsie will stay above 8,000 this time: most obviously, the dollar-pound effect can reverse, as it did slightly on Tuesday afternoon after the lunchtime warning from the Bank of England’s chief economist about the dangers of cutting UK interest rates too soon. And investors everywhere may be far too relaxed about Iran-Israel tensions. Best to stick to assessments of relative market value, on which score the UK looks cheap. But it has done for a while: a new high was overdue.",

        "title": "Jeremy Hunt’s scope for tax cuts hit by higher-than-expected borrowing",
        "content": "Jeremy Hunt’s scope for a substantial pre-election tax giveaway has been hit after the latest set of official figures showed the UK’s public finances in worse shape than thought at last month’s budget. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the government borrowed £120.7bn in the 2023-24 financial year – £6.6bn more than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had expected. Although the borrowing overshoot does not rule out fresh tax cuts before an autumn election, analysts say it would make life more difficult for the chancellor. Borrowing in March was just under £12bn – almost £5bn lower than in the same month a year ago but higher than the financial markets had predicted. The OBR said tax receipts in March had been more than £5bn lower than it had anticipated when preparing its budget forecasts, largely the result of weaker income tax and national insurance receipts. For 2023-24 as a whole, tax receipts rose by £66bn, while spending increased by £58bn, resulting in an £8bn fall in borrowing year on year to just over £120bn. Ruth Gregory, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said the government ran a deficit of 4.4% of GDP in 2023-24, well above the 2.7% deficit in 2019-20 and the 3.0% average in the five years before the Covid pandemic. Last year’s deficit was double the £60bn in 2019-20, but lower than the record £315bn in 2020-21, when lockdowns were in place. “Overall, if the chancellor was hoping March’s figures would provide more scope for tax cuts at a fiscal event later this year, he will have been disappointed,” she said. “Just based on the larger-than-expected 2023-24 budget deficit and the recent shift up in market interest rates, he may have even less fiscal ‘headroom’ (perhaps about £5bn) for tax cuts than the £8.9bn left over in March.” Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “We expect the chancellor to cut taxes again before a likely October or November general election despite borrowing overshooting his forecasts.” In a September autumn statement, the chancellor would be able to rely on the OBR extending its forecasts to 2029-30, Wood added. “Hunt can plan for another year of unrealistically weak public spending to generate ‘headroom’ against his fiscal rules and thereby manufacture the funds to cut taxes. “The next government will, therefore, face a tricky choice between raising taxes to fix creaking public services or holding the line on the chancellor’s recent tax cuts. We suspect whoever the next government is will end up pushing through at least some tax rises to balance the books.” Jessica Barnaby, the ONS deputy director for public sector finances, said spending on public services and benefits had outstripped a drop in debt interest payments as a result of falling inflation and outlays on government energy support schemes. National debt – the accumulation of borrowing over time – stood at 98.3% of national output in 2023-24, up 2.6 percentage points on 2022-23 and its highest level since the early 1960s. Alison Ring, the director of public sector and taxation at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: “As we approach a general election that is likely to focus on the state of the economy and the quality of public services, the weak state of the public finances at the start of the new financial year provides a shaky foundation for both main political parties as they finish writing their manifestos.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “Debt increased in recent years because we rightly protected millions of jobs during Covid and paid half of people’s energy bills after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine sent bills skyrocketing. “We can’t leave future generations to pick up the tab, so we must stick to the plan to get debt falling. And with inflation falling and wages rising we have been able to cut national insurance by a third, which shows our determination to end the double taxation of work.”",

        "title": "What’s behind the record FTSE 100 high?",
        "content": "The UK stock market has hit an intraday record high, lifted by hopes of interest rate cuts and easing geopolitical tensions, after setting a new closing high on Monday. The FTSE 100 index touched 8,076 points at the opening bell on Tuesday, surpassing a previous high of 8,047 reached in February 2023. We explain what is behind the rising London market. Why is the FTSE 100 rising now? UK shares have been buoyed up by expectations of two UK interest rate cuts this year, and a lack of escalation in the Middle East in the last few days. The UK economic picture has improved, with inflation slowing, the economy returning to growth after a shallow recession at the end of 2023 and hopes that real wages can rise without triggering a wage-price spiral. The FTSE 100, which was created 40 years ago, has been rising steadily in recent weeks amid hopes that the Bank of England will cut interest rates soon from their level of 5.25%, as inflation (now at 3.2%) moves towards the central bank’s 2% target. It would be the first interest rate reduction since March 2020. Having been the first big central bank to raise rates in the current cycle, the Bank is now expected to be one of the first of its peers to start cutting rates, before the US Federal Reserve, which is still battling stubbornly high inflation. Traders are now building up bets that the Fed could raise rates again, with markets pricing in a one-in-five chance of a US rate rise within the next 12 months. This has led to divergent fortunes for both countries’ currencies, causing the pound to weaken. Lower interest rates mean lower returns for investors. How does it compare internationally? The UK has been in the shadows of the US stock market for the past decade, partly because of the FTSE’s low exposure to the tech sector. That has proved a surprise boon in recent months, however, after nearly $1tn was wiped off the “Magnificent 7” tech stocks’ combined market value last week. The microchip designer Nvidia and the electronic carmaker Tesla both tumbled, netting traders who bet against them – known as short-sellers – billions of dollars. The FTSE 100 did not have a great year in 2023, when it rose 3.8%, held back by a stagnating economy and volatile political climate. Despite its recent rise, the index is still lagging behind its European peers. It is up 4% so far this year, behind the 7% increases in the German and French stock markets, and Italy’s 12% gain. Isn’t the FTSE 100 meant to be ‘Jurassic Park’? The UK stock market has lost some of its allure with a decline in listings and a string of firms opting to list on Wall Street instead, such as the British chip designer Arm last September. Shell’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, has hinted that the oil company could abandon its London primary listing, saying that if the firm’s valuation gap with its US peers does not close, “we have to look at all options. All options”. The FTSE has faced heavy criticism in recent years, thanks to its collection of older, low-growth companies. Paul Marshall, the boss of the £40bn ($55bn) hedge fund Marshall Wace, wrote in 2021 in the Financial Times that the City of London risked becoming “a sort of Jurassic Park”. Brexit and political uncertainty have also weighed on the FTSE. “That’s led to cheap valuations and a mountain of unloved stocks,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell. “Investors are finally getting the message that a good chunk of these businesses still have a lot to offer, delivering slow but steady profit growth, and they’re available for a fraction of the price of some of their overseas peers.” What’s happening to sterling and the dollar? A weaker pound has contributed to the rise in the FTSE 100, as stocks move in an inverse relationship to the currency. About three-quarters of the FTSE 100 are large international companies that earn their revenues in dollars and report their profits in sterling. This means that when the dollar strengthens, these companies become more profitable in sterling terms. Higher US interest rates make dollars more attractive to hold, and so demand for dollars has increased, driving up the greenback’s value. What does it mean for me? Those invested in UK shares will be cheering the rise in the FTSE after a long period of underperformance. Many big FTSE companies also pay decent dividends. Rolls-Royce is the best performer so far this year, after its success last year, with traders encouraged by the turnaround plan being implemented by the new chief executive, Tufan Erginbilgiç. On Tuesday, almost everything was trading higher apart from mining stocks, after Primark owner Associated British Foods’ upbeat trading and JD Sports’ expansion in the US.",

        "title": "‘Workers end up paying the price’: laborers call for safer building sites",
        "content": "Wooden planks with nails covered the site where Antonio, a construction day laborer in Houston, Texas, was helping clear fencing last December. The contractor that hired him provided no protection, he said – so when he slipped, and a nail struck him just above the ankle, it became “really swollen”. Antonio was given hydrogen peroxide, and the contractor promised to get him medical attention the next day. But after developing a fever overnight, and with his ankle still swollen, he took himself to the emergency room. Upon arrival, he was told if he had waited much longer, doctors might have needed to amputate his leg below the knee. “I spent about 16 days in the hospital,” Antonio, who requested to omit his last name for fear of retaliation, said. After two weeks, the contractor – which had not picked up the phone the day after his accident – got in touch. They wanted to know “if I was ready to work”, Antonio said. His injury was never reported to the proper authorities. He has not received compensation. The incident was not unusual. More than 450,000 workers were injured by falls, slips and trips in 2021 and 2022, according to official data, with 865 fatalities recorded in 2022 alone. Of those who died, more than 400 were construction workers, according to the Center for Construction Research and Training. Employers are required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) to protect workers from falls on the job, by providing guardrails, harnesses, scaffolding and personal safety gear when necessary, and provide training to workers. “Construction is a dangerous industry, but falls are preventable, 100%,” said Ryan Papariello, safety and health specialist at the Laborers’ Health and Safety Fund of North America. “We know how to prevent these incidents.” But in many cases where injuries and fatalities of workers occur, basic Osha protections are not being followed, or implemented at all. “Probably the most important to me is a general awareness of the job site, what’s going on around you, and the confidence to be able to stand up and say, ‘Stop, this is unsafe,’” said Anton Ruesing, executive director of the International Finishing Trades Institute. “A lot of workers don’t feel comfortable enough to say, ‘Hold on a second, that’s unsafe, and I’m not going to do that.’” Antonio, for example, claimed he and other workers were not given proper breaks or enough water on the job, and had little recourse because if they speak up, they won’t be able to get work again. “These contractors mislead you and lie about the job, they lie about the pay and end up paying less than the amount they promised,” he said. “They take advantage of us and that’s how they are lining their pockets, by abusing people like us.” While Osha regularly issues citations and penalties in cases where a worker is killed on the job and safety protocols were not followed or implemented, its fines have been criticized as being too low to deter bad behavior by employers. Legislation to modernize the federal agency in charge of protecting workers, including the expansion of its coverage to 24 states not currently covered, has stalled in Congress. “Workers die and get injured when management basically fails to provide a safe workplace,” said Jessica Martinez, co-executive director of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health. “Doing a job safely in construction and other industries requires time, money, management, attention and other resources. So when management decides not to spend that time, money and attention, then workers end up paying the price.” “We’ve come a long way, but we still have a ways to go,” said Ruesing. “The fact that deaths and fatalities are figured into a job in terms of costs and insurance, it’s still disgusting.” ••• Gabriel Strathern fell to his death while working on a roofing job in Raleigh, North Carolina. He was 29. Osha fined his employer on the job, the roof and window cleaning firm Squeaky Clean, about $17,000 for failing to provide fall protection or sufficient safety training. During separate legal proceedings, the owner of Squeaky Clean, James Crisp, was asked why he had not reported Strathern’s death to Osha. “I didn’t know that I was required to,” he said, according to a copy of a deposition obtained by the Guardian. Devin Gilgor, Strathern’s father, said: “A month before, Gabriel had fallen off a roof, but hadn’t sustained any serious injuries and when he asked about reporting the incident to Osha, his employer told him, ‘We don’t do Osha.’ “They knew this house was very dangerous, because the roof pitch was at a peak angle and he still wasn’t given any fall protection equipment.” Gilgor explained that he was the one who reported the incident to Osha the next day, and that to this day he has never received a phone call or apology from his son’s employer. The fines paid by Squeaky Clean, and other employers found in breach of the rules, are not enough, according to Gilgor. “When a death or permanent disability occurs on the job, the ability of an employer to negotiate fines should not be an option,” he said. “Not only civil but criminal charges need to be pursued. Avoiding workplace accidents should be our main focus. “Employers need to be made aware of Osha regulations. Employees need to be made aware of their rights to a safe work environment and Osha needs to come up with better ways to reach the workplace.” Squeaky Clean and an attorney representing Crisp did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",

        "title": "Grocery price rises in Great Britain slow as cost of toilet rolls, butter and milk falls",
        "content": "Grocery price inflation in Great Britain has slowed to 3.2%, the lowest since November 2021, as the cost of toilet rolls, butter and milk fell and people spent more on store promotions. The decline in the four weeks to 14 April marked the 14th monthly drop in a row, and compares with an annual rate of 4.5% this time last month, according to the retail analysts Kantar. The slowdown in grocery inflation was aided by a big increase in promotional spending, with items bought on offer making up 29% of supermarket sales – the highest level outside Christmas since June 2021. Overall take-home grocery sales rose by about 3%. Deals helped shoppers save £1.3bn over the four weeks, amounting to £46 a household. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Worldpanel by Kantar, said: “We’ve been monitoring steady annual growth in promotions over the past 11 months as retailers respond to consumers’ desire for value. This emphasis on offers, coupled with falling prices in some categories like toilet tissues, butter and milk, has helped to bring the rate of grocery inflation down for shoppers at the till.” An early Easter did not dent seasonal sales, as spending on confectionery topped £100m for the first time in the seven days up to and including Easter Sunday. McKevitt said: “Higher prices have played a role in reaching that record spend figure, but the number of chocolate eggs sold in the seven days to Easter was also 3% higher this spring than last, with 37% of consumers buying one in that week. Hot-cross buns were even more popular, enjoyed by 45% of Britons.” The growth in confectionery reflected a broader trend towards snacking in Britain. Over the past decade, there has been an increase in almost all types of snacks. Consumers ate chocolate 93m more times in the year to June 2023 than in the 12 months to June 2013. Fruit has also bumped up the list of snack choices – 314m more such items were eaten between meals in 2023 than in 2013. Ocado was again the fastest-growing grocer this month, improving sales by 12.5% in the 12 weeks to 14 April, ahead of the total online market, which grew by 6.8%. The retailer accounted for 1.9% of take-home grocery sales, up from 1.7% a year ago. Total online sales reached a share of 12% of the whole market for the first time since July 2022. Britain’s two largest grocers, Tesco and Sainsbury’s, gained market share to 27.4% and 15.3% respectively. Sainsbury’s’ sales increased by 6.8% and Tesco grew by 5.9%. Lidl achieved a record 8% share of the market, also up by 0.4 percentage points compared with a year ago, fuelled by sales growth of 9.1%. Its fellow discounter Aldi reclaimed the 10% market share it last held in September 2023, increasing sales by 2.8%. Morrisons’ slice of the market was flat at 8.7%, with spending through its tills up by 3.8%. Waitrose and Iceland also retained their market share positions at 4.5% and 2.2% respectively. Both retailers recorded sales growth of 3.7%. Asda holds 13.4% of the market, while Co-op accounts for 5.4%.",

        "title": "P&O Ferries seafarers told they will benefit from new French pay rules",
        "content": "P&amp;O Ferries seafarers have been told they will benefit from new French legislation that could double their pay, in what appears to be a significant U-turn by the controversial ferry operator. The move comes more than two years after P&amp;O enraged the UK and French governments by sacking 786 workers and then taking advantage of a legal loophole to hire replacements on pay rates of below the minimum wage. The company claimed it had been forced into the dismissals in order to stay in business, with the P&amp;O chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, telling a UK joint transport and business select committee at the time: “The business was not viable. This is the only way for us to save this business.” London and Paris responded to the sackings by announcing new legislation, with France implementing fresh regulations last month requiring ferry operators to pay their crew at least £9.95 an hour and limiting seafarers’ time onboard ships to two weeks. The French rules will come into effect after a three-month implementation period, while a similar UK law – requiring ferry operators to pay the UK minimum wage of £11.44 an hour – is expected to come into force this summer. Rival cross-Channel operators had feared P&amp;O could launch legal challenges to the legislation. However, a letter sent to workers employed by P&amp;O’s Maltese employment agency Philcrew Management last week, seen by the Guardian and ITV News, states: “The French Republic has recently adopted new regulation that applies to passenger ships operating between France and the UK, including therefore the vessels in our fleet crossing the Channel. “Under such new regulation, the maximum duration of the embarkation is up to 14 days and [an equivalent] minimum rest period ashore … Serious consequences [for ferry operators] are provided for violating such new provisions.” Last month the Guardian and ITV reported that P&amp;O agency cross-Channel workers were in some cases making about £4.87 an hour – even lower than the £5.15 an hour the company had suggested was its lowest rate. Meanwhile, P&amp;O crew members said they worked 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, for up to 17 weeks at a time. The workers said they had to remain on the ship until their contract ended. The low rates being paid to P&amp;O workers were achieved lawfully, with the company taking advantage of loopholes that exempted paying the minimum wage to maritime workers employed by an overseas agency and working on foreign-registered ships in international waters. Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, said: “P&amp;O Ferries has refused to do the right thing from the beginning of this scandal, and they’ve only been dragged under the threat of criminal sanctions and hefty fines by the French government. “They will never do the right thing until legislation is in place to protect seafarers’ rights, and that’s why it’s so important that the UK government put in place a binding seafarers charter. Otherwise, businesses that can profit from this business model will continue to undercut workers’ rights and legislation.” P&amp;O Ferries did not respond to Haigh’s comments or answer questions about its apparent U-turn and how much the changes would add to the company’s costs. A spokesperson for P&amp;O has previously said its crew is well rested, that the company pays its cross-Channel crew members at least £5.20 an hour and that it pays “at least the minimum wage required by national and international law”. It has stated: “We provide an industry-leading support package and work hard to ensure their welfare, wellbeing and mental health are properly cared for.” Philcrew Management did not respond to requests for comment.",

        "content": "Three co-founders of CVC Capital Partners, the private equity firm that bought up and then sold Formula One, have built up a combined €2.6bn (£2.2bn) fortune, according to the company’s prospectus published in the run-up to its stock market float. Donald Mackenzie, 66, holds 7% of CVC’s shares that would be worth just over €1bn if the company achieves its €15-per-share price target when it lists its shares on the Amsterdam stock market on Friday. He is planning to sell shares worth up to €150m in the initial public offering (IPO), the company said in the prospectus. Co-founder Rolly van Rappard, 64, who will serve as CVC’s chair, holds shares worth about €950m, while his fellow co-founder Steve Koltes, 68, has shares worth about €600m. The three men’s combined shares could be worth more than €2.6bn. The trio co-founded CVC when they spun it out of Citigroup in 1993, and have built it into one of the largest private equity groups in Europe. It manages more than €180bn of assets, including a stake in the Six Nations rugby tournament and Lipton Teas. It is based in low-tax Luxembourg. Mackenzie, who is Scottish but lives in the tax haven of Jersey, became the chair of the company that ran Formula One after masterminding CVC’s buyout of the motorsport in 2006. It went on to sell the business to Liberty Media for $8bn in 2016. He is said to own a 52-metre superyacht called Grace, while van Rappard owns a 56-metre superyacht called Blue II that is estimated to be worth $50m, according to Superyachtfan.com. CVC hopes the listing will value the business at up to €15bn. It has recently taken stakes in big brands such as Lipton and the Swiss watchmaker Breitling, but also in media rights for LaLiga, Spain’s top football league. It came close to a stock market listing in May 2022 and November 2023 but decided to postpone due to market uncertainty. CVC will become the latest large private equity fund to list, with its rivals Blackstone, EQT, Bridgepoint and KKR all going public in recent years. Rob Lucas, the CVC chief executive, said: “We have spent more than 40 years building the CVC network and developing a unique entrepreneurial culture centred on delivering consistent investment outperformance for our clients. “We believe an IPO of CVC provides an enduring long-term institutional structure to support further growth, we remain completely focused on the continued success of CVC, and neither I nor any of my active partners are selling shares as part of this transaction.”",

        "title": "FTSE 100 hits record closing high amid hopes of interest rates cuts – as it happened",
        "content": "We must wait until tomorrow morning, at the earliest, to see if the FTSE 100 can storm to a new intraday alltime high (beating its previous record of 8,047 points). If the pound continues to weaken, and if tensions in the Midde East continue to ease, it’s quite possible. Until then, here’s today’s main stories: Bloomberg have calculated that Shell and BP alone accounting for almost half of the 4% rise in the FTSE 100 so far this year. They add: AstraZeneca, HSBC Holdings and jet-engine maker Rolls-Royce are also among the main drivers. George Lagarias, chief economist at Mazars, says the FTSE 100 still has a way to go to catch up to its peers. “The FTSE 100 hitting it’s all time-highs on Monday is certainly a positive signal for investors who are looking to capitalise on the low valuations of good quality British equities. To be sure, the index has a long way to climb if it is to catch up to the recent performance of its developed market peers. And more will be required for the LSE to attract foreign listings.” Britain’s FTSE 250 share index, which contains medium-sized coompanies, had a decent day today too. The FTSE 250 jumped by 1.07% today, or by 208 points, to 19,599 points, led by Tyman +30%) after the UK door and window handle-maker agreed a takeover offer from a US rival. The FTSE 250 is seen as a better gauge of the UK economy than the FTSE 100, and it’s notable that it is around 20% off its alltime high, set in 2021.…. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, sums up a historic day on the London stock market: “While the FTSE 100 failed to hit a new intraday high, it did achieve a new record closing high at 8,023. The strong session, with the UK index up 1.6% on the day, is another reminder that the UK market is not dead in the water. “The all-time intraday high for the FTSE 100 is 8,047 and today it was just a handful of points away from breaking that level. Driving the market was renewed optimism that Middle East tensions are easing, leading to a buying spree among investors. Sterling weakness also benefited the army of FTSE stocks that earn in US dollars. “The Bank of England is now expected to start cutting rates before the Federal Reserve sharpens its knife and that’s led to divergent fortunes for the respective currencies. “Favourite items on the menu to fill portfolios included Marks &amp; Spencer, which was the recipient of a positive broker note from Jefferies telling clients to buy the stock, alongside Next and Sainsbury’s. All three saw their ratings lifted from ‘hold’ to ‘buy’ as part of a review of the broader retail sector. “The timing of the upgrades was savvy given how attention is shifting to the Bank of England potentially being the trailblazer with rate cuts this summer. That implies consumers could soon be feeling flush if financial pressures ease, and for many there is nothing better than a shopping spree to lift the spirits. “The key contributors to the FTSE in terms of index points were AstraZeneca, HSBC, Shell and GSK. “Across the pond, the Nasdaq got off to a wobbly start, quickly losing strength as investors braced themselves for a potentially testing week ahead as the mega-caps start to report quarterly numbers, starting with Tesla tomorrow.” The weakness of the pound today, as it sagged to a five-month low, was a major factor behind the FTSE 100’s rally to an alltime closing high. Rachel Winter, partner at Killik &amp; Co, explains: “The FTSE 100 has just hit a record closing high of 8023. This is largely due to the weakness of sterling versus the dollar. The FTSE contains a large number of big international companies that earn their revenue in dollars and report their profits in sterling. When the dollar strengthens, these companies become more profitable in sterling terms. The strength of the dollar is due to sticky inflation in the US, which means that US interest rates will remain higher for longer. Higher US interest rates make dollars more attractive to hold, and so demand for dollars has increased and their price has risen.” Newsflash: Britain’s blue-chip share index has hit a new alltime closing high. The FTSE 100 index, which tracks the one hundred largest companies listed in London, has closed at its highest ever level, at 8023.87 points, after jumping by 128 points (+1.62%) today. That’s above its previous record close of 8,014 points, set in February 2023. But, this still leaves the FTSE 100 slightly below its alltime intraday high of 8,047.06 points, also set in February last year. Most of the companies on the Footsie rallied today, with retailers among the risers. Marks &amp; Spencer gained 4.4%, Sainsbury rose by 3.9% and Tesco gained 3.4%. Today’s rally came as geopolitical tensions eased in the financial markets, with investors relieved there were no further clashes between Israel and Iran last weekend. Hopes of interest rate cuts this year also supported the market, after deputy Bank of England governor Sir Dave Ramsden said last Friday that UK inflation could be lower than expected over the next three years, near the BoE’s target of 2%. The money markets are now fully pricing a cut to UK interest rates, by August, lowering from from 5.25% to 5%, with two cuts this year expected. Drum role….. the London stock market has just entered the end-of-day closing auction, so we’ll soon know where the FTSE 100 has ended the day. Going into the auction, the index was up around 136 points at 8031 points, which would be a record closing high, but not an intraday high. Just five minutes of trading to go in London… and the FTSE 100’s on track to end at a record closing high…. Let’s not rule out a record high on the FTSE 100 today, though. The index is having a late run at the record (8,047 points), and is now up 141 points (+1.75%) back at 8037 points. That would be a record closing high (but not, quite, an intraday high, which is what really counts). Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “London’s blue-chip index has had a surge of power as heightened geopolitical tensions have eased, and investors assessed the brighter prospects for the UK economy, with interest rate cuts spied on the horizon. It’s tantalisingly close to breaching the all-time intraday high of 8,047 and it’s been trading above its record closing value of 8,014. Gold, a safe haven asset, has slipped back slightly in the absence of fresh attacks by Iran or Israel. However, the precious metal is still hovering close to record highs. Brent Crude has also fallen back slightly as the focus turns to the prospects of weakening demand in the US if high interest rates linger for longer. However, it’s not had much effect on the share prices of the big energy giants. Tensions are still simmering in the Middle East and there are ongoing concerns about the potential that they could flare up again, causing fresh disruption to supplies. The gold price has eased away from its recent record highs today, as geopolitical worries ease. Spot gold is down 2.4% at $2,338 per ounce, down around $52 per ounce today. Earlier this month it hit a record high of $2,431 per ounce, as investors nervous about inflation or the Middle East crisis bought into gold as a safe haven. George Khoury, global head of education and research at CFI, explains: The gold market experienced a strong decline today, as fears surrounding a wider conflict in the Middle East eased, reducing the need for investors to seek safe-haven assets like gold. However, geopolitical concerns could remain an important driving force for gold. Furthermore, market participants are now keenly awaiting a crucial U.S. inflation reading - the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index - due later this week. This data point is expected to provide important cues on the future trajectory of interest rates, which can significantly impact the attractiveness of non-yielding assets like gold. Ahead of this week’s important economic data releases, including the flash global PMIs and the US Advance Q1 GDP report, traders could remain cautious as stronger-than-expected data could drive gold lower. Despite the positive start to trading on Wall Street, the FTSE 100 has slipped away from the record high…. it’s now trading around 8027 points. It’s still a strong day’s trading, with the Footsie up 1.6% or 130 points so far today. The New York stock market has opened with gains on the main indices. The Dow Jones industrial average, which tracks 30 large US stocks, is up 167 points at the open at 38,153, +0.44%. The broader S&amp;P 500 index gained 0.5%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is 0.7% higher. But electric car maker Tesla continues to lose ground in the markets. It has dropped by 5% in early trading, after cutting prices late last week in an attempt to drum up sales. Tesla is due to report its financial results tomorrow, with analysts expecting its worst performance in seven years. Elon Musk has postponed a trip to India, including a planned meeting with the prime minister, Narendra Modi, so he can focus on “very heavy obligations” at the company. The odds of seeing a new alltime on the London stock market today are narrowing… with the FTSE 100 now touching 8041 points. Just six points off the record…. The FTSE 100 is inching yet closer to the alltime peak… its now up to 8037 points, +140 today, meaning it’s just 10 points shy of the record. Nearly every stock on the Footsie is up today. In the airline sector, workers who refuel aircraft at Heathrow Airport are to strike in a dispute over terms and conditions. Members of Unite employed by AFS will walk out for 72 hours from 4th May. The union said AFS, a joint venture between oil and gas companies, was planning to cut pension and sickness benefits. Heathrow Airport is working on contingencies with AFS to manage any potential disruption, saying it has “robust” measures planned, adding that passengers can book flights from Heathrow with confidence. Grocery technology business Ocado are the top riser on the FTSE 100, up 4.3%. They’re followed by fellow retailers Marks &amp; Spencer (+3.7%) and Sainsbury’s (+3.6%). Ocado rallied after the Telegraph reported last weekend that it was under pressure from shareholders to consider abandoning the London stock market for New York, where it could get a higher vauation. This is keeping the FTSE 100 within sight of its record high; its now up to 8,027 points, just 20 points off the peak. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, says: The widespread gains seen for the index have seen the retailers and supermarkets come in for particular strength, led by Ocado’s gains as shareholders push for the company to shift their listing over to the US. The relatively elevated US-valuations have been a key concern for UK businesses, with CEO’s faced with the prospect of either moving their listing or fending off interest from hungry US companies seeking to employ a M&amp;A led growth model Britain’s index of medium-sized companies, the FTSE 250, is also having a strong day. The FTSE 100’s smaller sibling is up 1.05% today at 19,594 points. That’s still a long way from the FTSE 250’s record high of 24,353 points set in September 2021. Tyman are the top riser, up 30%, after agreeing to be taken over by US building supplies company Quanex in a £788m deal (see earlier post). The pound is continuing to drop against the US dollar; it’s now down over half a cent today at $1.2317, a new five-month low. That’s helping to push up the FTSE 100, as it makes the overseas earnings of multinationals more valuable. The index is now up around 130 points or 1.6% today at 8027 points – just 20 points off the all-time high…. NatWest, Accord, Leeds Building Society and HSBC have announced rate increases today, Sky News reports. This follows the rise in swap rates – used by lenders to price mortgages – last week, after inflation rates in the UK and the US came in higher than expected in March. Wall Street is set to open higher when trading begins in New York in under two and a half hours. That could give stocks in London another lift. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all on track to rise around 0.5%, according to the futures market. The FTSE 100 has now climbed over its highest closing level. The index is trading at 8,015 points right now, slightly above its highest ever close of 8,014 points set in February 2023. The GMB union is unimpressed by Thames Water presenting its new business plan that could push up customer bills by 44% - even more than the 40% previously proposed. Gary Carter, GMB National Officer, says: “It’s not for hard-up bill payers to dig Thames out of the financial mess they’ve created. “The shareholders who trouser millions since privatisation must fork out to give the company a chance to turn things round. “You can’t expect customers to pay £627 a year to pay for the past failures of Thames Water. “Previous owners have taken the profits in huge dividends rather than putting in the investment needed.” Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is rallying higher. It’s now up 111 points or 1.4% at 8007 points, on track for its fourth daily gain in a row – which would be its best run since mid-February. As covered earlier, shares are being lifted by hopes that the Bank of England will ease interest rates by half a percentage point by the end of this year, with the first rate cut now priced in for August. The absence of further attacks between Iran and Israel last weekend has also cheered investors, as geopolitical tensions fade. “The FTSE 100 bounced back strongly on Monday amid relief that tensions in the Middle East seem to have been contained for now,” says AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould, adding: “Travel and retail stocks were among the gainers on the FTSE 100, with precious metals miner Fresnillo the only stock showing notable weakness, with gold and silver prices dipping as demand for safe havens eased. The index is now only 40 points off the alltime high set in February 2023: Newsflash: The House of Lords Financial Services Regulation Committee is calling on the City regulator to pause its plan to “name and shame” companies under investigation more frequently. The Committee are asking the Financial Conduct Authority to freeze the plan to announce its enforcement investigations into firms in advance, while it gathers evidence and scrutinises the proposal. It fears the plan could undermine the overall integrity of the market, and lead to reputations being unfairly tarnished. Committee chair Lord Forsyth of Drumlean says: “The FCA’s plan to announce the opening of new enforcement investigations could have a highly negative impact on firms subsequently cleared following a potentially lengthy investigation. Despite having done nothing wrong, those firms, and individuals associated with them, risk having their reputations tarnished. This could also unnecessarily distort the market. “’Innocent until proven guilty’ is a fundamental principle of our justice system. The committee is presently unconvinced that the FCA has justified departing from this important principle and taking an approach that is at odds with almost all other financial services regulators. The Financial Times reported last night that government insiders are concerned the FCA’s approach to regulation is harming the City of London and driving business abroad. The City money markets are brought forward their forecast for the Bank of England’s first interest rate cut to August. City investors are pricing in a more rapid easing from the BoE this morning, after its deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden predicted on Friday that UK inflation could be lower than expected over the next few years. They now expect the first cut in Bank rate, from 5.5% to 5%, in August, rather than September, with a second cut to 4.75% priced in by December. Last week, the markets briefly indicated the first cut might not come until November, after inflation fell by less than expected in March, to 3.2%. Ramsden told an audience in Washington DC that he was confident that headline inflation will fall sharply in April, to close to the 2% target, from 3.2% in March. And significantly, Ramsden also revealed that he believes the “balance of domestic risks” to the UK inflation outlook is more negative than in February, when the Bank predicted inflation would drop this year, but then rise back to 3%. Now, Ramsden says, it’s “at least as likely” that inflation stays close to the Bank’s 2% target over the next three years. The oil price has dipped to its lowest level in almost four weeks this morning, as anxiety over Middle East tensions ease. Brent crude is down 1.5% in early trading today at $85.94 per barrel, the lowest since 27th March. Last Friday, Brent jumped as high as $90.75 per barrel, before easing back after Tehran downplayed Israel’s missile attack on the Iranian city of Isfahan. Today’s fall means oil is now back to its levels just before Israel attacked an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria on 1 April, killing 11 people including two senior Iranian generals. Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo, market analyst Latam at XS.com, says hopes for a diplomatic resolution and moderation in the region have dampened concerns and contributed to short-term oil price stability. In conclusion, Iran’s measured response to the alleged Israeli attack in Isfahan has underscored the importance of diplomacy in times of high tension in the Middle East. Although financial markets initially reacted with concern, the retreat in oil prices reflects the hope of avoiding conflict escalation. However, the situation remains delicate and requires constant monitoring. Stability in the region and the security of the global oil supply largely depends on the ability of the parties involved to stay calm and seek diplomatic solutions to the challenges they face. Shares have jumped in London at the start of the new trading week, as geopolitical tensions ease. Britain’s FTSE 100 share index has gained 93 points, or 1.2%, to 7990 points in early trading, heading closer to its alltime high of 8,047 points. Shares are recovering amid relief that last weekend passed off without further attacks in the Middle East, after Israel’s missile attack against Iran last Friday. Investors could also be cheered that the US House of Representatives finally approved more than $61bn worth of military assistance to help Ukraine on Saturday. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: ‘’The FTSE 100 has spring in its step at the start of the week, amid an easing of geopolitical tensions. The pulse of positivity comes in the absence of fresh retaliatory attacks by Israel or Iran and the US flexing its funding muscle and passing a crucial aid package for Ukraine. Stocks are higher across most of Europe too, with Germany’s DAX up 0.46% and France’s CAC 0.2% higher. Losses at model maker Hornby have widened, after disruption to shipments through the Middle East delayed deliveries of stock and hit sales. Hornby reported that its underlying loss before tax weakened in the second half of its financial year (the six months to the end of March), while sales only grew by 2%. In the final quarter, from January to March, sales fell by 8% year-on-year. It blames an early Easter this year, and Red Sea delivery delays which meant some some high value containers didn’t arrive until April. Hornby’s net debt rose to £14.3m on 31 March, up from £5.5m a year before, which it says is mainly due to the trading loss and capital expenditure. That is slightly better than the £14.6m reported halfway through the financial year, though. Hornby adds that its remains “cautious” in its outlook, due to “the natural challenges facing a business in turnaround, and the uncertainty of the wider economic and socio-political factors affecting all businesses at this time.” Thames Water could raise bills to as much as £627 a year to pay to fix its leaky network, after promising to invest up to £3bn more over the next five years (see earlier post), my colleague Alex Lawson writes. More here: The share price of London-listed CBD vape company Chill Brands has slumped 23% after it announced the suspension of its chief executive in connection with an investigation into the use of inside information. The company is a minnow valued at only £16m before the announcement. It had been under pressure because of proposed ban on disposable vapes in the UK. Now the company has said that it has asked law firm Fieldfisher to investigate, and that it will work with the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. It is also looking for an interim chief executive. Chief executive Callum Sommerton has been suspended “in connection with these allegations”, the company said, adding: This suspension does not constitute disciplinary action or a disciplinary penalty and does not imply any assumption that Mr Sommerton is guilty of any misconduct or that any decision has been made. Estate agents and lenders are reporting that the housing market picked up this spring, following Rightmove’s data showed average asking prices are near their highest level. But there’s not universal agreement…. Tomer Aboody, director of property lender MT Finance, attributes this to stability in the mortgage markets: “With a pick up in sales providing further confidence in the market, we are seeing the fruits of a stable interest rate environment, combined with reduced inflation, all contributing to an increase in asking prices. “With the announcement that the government may be looking to introduce another stamp duty restructure in the autumn ahead of the general election, this will provide a further boost for the housing market, saving buyers thousands of pounds.” Marc von Grundherr, director of Benham and Reeves, says easing cost of living pressures are helping the market: “Spring has sprung in housing market terms with growing buyer demand pushing sellers to increase asking prices to near record levels. As the rate of inflation slows and market uncertainty subsides, the property market is responding, as it always does, with upward price movements. What’s more, wage growth is now outstripping both consumer inflation and house price growth, ensuring that for the first time in years, house price affordability is actually improving.” While north London estate agent Jeremy Leaf reports that some buyers are still haggling on prices… “The market continues to play catch-up as the increase in new enquiries is emboldening sellers, not only to make their properties available, but chance their arm at higher asking figures. “The prospect of more stable or even falling mortgage rates is certainly helping to improve confidence generally. “However, the uplift in supply has meant more choice so the market remains price sensitive and buyers are negotiating hard, particularly those who require little or no finance.” However, Charlie Lamdin of Bestagent argues that the asking price data is distorted by more people listing expensive properties, and that “actual house prices are mostly falling”. The London Stock Exchange’s mid-sized FTSE 250 index is due to lose one of its manufacturing members to a US takeover. Tyman, a member of the FTSE 250 that makes door and window components, will be bought by a US rival Quanex in a £788m cash and shares deal, the two companies annoucned this morning. The takeover is a 35% premium to Tyman’s share price at the close of trading on Friday. Tyman’s board recommended shareholders accept the Quanex offer. Nicky Hartery, chair of Tyman, said: In the context of a rapidly evolving North American marketplace, our board ultimately determined that this transaction is the best path to maximising value for Tyman shareholders, who will be able to realise a meaningful portion of their holding in cash at a significant premium to the prevailing share price while also participating in the future upside of the enlarged group. The 400p per share offer may be a premium to Tyman’s closing price, but it is also short of the prices reached as recently as July 2022. Yet another takeover by a US rival will do nothing to assuage concerns about the gradual whittling down of the UK’s listed companies. One concern has been that UK companies are relatively undervalued compared to US rivals. That makes it easier for US companies to get a good deal when mounting takeovers. Troubled water company Thames has this morning outlined plans to increase spending on its network to tackle leaks and sewage spills by at least £1.1bn. Thames, which is fighting to avoid temporary nationalisation, has submitted an update to its business plan for 2025-2030, under which it would spend £19.8bn to address environmental concerns over sewage dumping, guarantee high quality drinking water and ensure the security of water supplies. It had previously proposed spending £18.7bn on its network, under a plan that would lift customer bills by 40% to an average of £608 by 2030. This extra £1.1bn will not lead to even higher bills, Thames pledges, as it will rebalance “operating and capital expenditures”. BUT, it is also proposing a further £1.9bn of potential investment – if the regulator approves, this would add an extra £19 to bills, taking the average to £627. Chris Weston, CEO of Thames Water, said: “Our business plan focuses on our customers’ priorities. As part of the usual ongoing discussions relating to PR24 [Thames’s business plan], we’ve now updated it to deliver more projects that will benefit the environment. We will continue to discuss this with our regulators and stakeholders.” The Guardian reported last week that government plans were being drawn up for the renationalisation of Thames Water, under which most of its £15.6bn debt would be added to the public purse. Its parent company defaulted on a debt at the start of this month, raising the prospect that the company could face a significant restructure or even ultimately collapse. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The asking price for UK homes is creeping closer to a record high, as demand for larger, more expensive houses picks up. New data from Rightmove this morning shows that the average price of property coming to the market rose by 1.1% (+£4,207) this month to £372,324. That’s just £570 short of the record set in May 2023. But “Top of the ladder” properties saw the biggest jump in asking prices in the last month (from 10th March – 13th April 2024). They rose by 2.7%, while the price tag on smaller properties more suited to first-time buyers only rose 0.3%. Rightmove reports that the number of sales agreed so far this year is 13% higher than at this stage in 2023, as activity rebounds from last year’s much more subdued Spring. Activity picked up at the end of last month; Thursday 28th March was the busiest day for new homes coming onto the market this year, and the third busiest since August 2020. Rightmove suspects there is currently a “window of opportunity” for those considering a move to act, before a busy summer of sporting events (including the Olympics and Euro 2024) and the looming general distract movers. Rightmove’s Tim Bannister says: The top-of-the-ladder sector continues to drive pricing activity at the start of the year, with movers in this sector typically less sensitive to higher mortgage rates, and more equity rich, contributing to their ability to move. While some buyers, across all sectors, will feel that their affordability has improved compared to last year due to wage growth and stable house prices, others will be more impacted by cost-of-living challenges and stickier than expected high mortgage rates. Asking prices aren’t the same as actual selling prices, of course; Halifax reported earlier this month that house prices dipped in March for the first time this year. Estate agents have warned that sellers who overprice their properties will struggle to find buyers, and end up cutting asking prices to get a deal. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) reported this month that demand continued to “recover gradually”, after being hit by the surge in mortgage costs last year. Uncertainty over the path of UK interest rates could still weigh on the market this year, with the Bank of England currently expected to only cut rates twice by the end of 2024, to 4.75%. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, says: “Buyers and sellers have faced mixed messages in 2024 as interest rate predictions have fluctuated. While rising asking prices show seller expectations have improved, there is broader downwards pressure on prices as mortgage rates edge higher, supply increases and a wave of people roll off sub-2% fixed-rate mortgages agreed in early 2022. The result is more friction around prices, particularly when a rate cut seems to move further into the distance with every release of economic data. That said, higher supply means there should be a recognisable spring bounce in the housing market.” The agenda 9.30am BST: Nathanaël Benjamin, executive director for Financial Stability Strategy &amp; Risk at the Bank of England, speaks at a Bloomberg event 11am BST: CBI industrial trends survey of UK factry sector 1.30pm BST: The Chicago Fed National Activity Index for March 3pm BST: Eurozone consumer confdence stats 4.30pm BST: ECB president Christine Lagarde gives a lecture at Yale University",

        "title": "Thames Water’s extra £1.1bn will do little to steady the sinking ship",
        "content": "Thames Water has made a £1.1bn stab at answering the questions swirling around the troubled company, updating its five-year business plan. But it failed to address the one issue that will define its future: how it will find the funds to survive, other than trying to squeeze more money from customers. Since its spending plan was first submitted to the regulator Ofwat in October, the government has accelerated contingency plans in case Thames goes bust, its shareholders have pulled the plug on £500m of funding and industry “bruiser” Chris Weston is now its chief executive. On Monday, the plan – covering 2025 to 2030 – was updated with fresh statistics. The firm now promises to spend extra £1.1bn on top of the £18.7bn already pledged to tackle environmental issues. (The Guardian revealed last week that Thames was deliberating whether to add £1bn or £1.5bn to figure, and considering approaching debt markets). The company hasa £15.6bn debt mountain. Thames was reluctant to spell out what precisely the £1.1bn will be spent on. The main reason for upping spending appears to be compliance on government statutory requirements to protect the environment amid widespread opprobrium over Thames’s sewage dumping record. The company, which uses investor funds upfront and recovers spending from customers, said it would not need to increase bills by any more than the chunky 40% rise already demanded as it was “rebalancing” its spending allocations. (Although that number excludes inflation.) Overall, the near £20bn will be spent on various projects, from £4.7bn on improving service quality to replacing 310 miles (500km) of water mains and £640m for upgrading two sites. Other work includes efforts to improve the taste and smell of its water and reducing unplanned outages. A curious element to the update was a further £1.9bn earmarked over the five years if Thames can find the capacity in the supply chain. With every company in the sector spending heavily to atone for the sins of the past, workers from labourers and specialists are in short supply. Thames will seek permission each year to spend chunks of this cash. If it achieves the feat, bills would rise even further, by 44%, to £627 a year by 2030. Again, government requirements – including reducing emissions and protecting assets from terrorist attacks – are the driver for the spending. The company’s longstanding critics are suitably exercised. The Liberal Democrats say consumers should not have to foot the bill for its “shambolic failings”. The GMB union blames the previous owners (step forward, Macquarie) for taking “the profits in huge dividends rather than putting in the investment”. The Consumer Council for Water says the update offers “nothing to ease the fears of those already struggling to pay”. In reality, Monday’s update is a sideshow; a regulatory hoop through which a tired Thames must drag itself. Its shareholders won’t see Thames as any more investable as a result and a painful financial restructuring remains a racing certainty. Thames owners’ argument has been that Ofwat has been too stringent. The gap between the cash the company needs – both to run day to day and to revamp its knackered network of leaky Victorian assets – and the amount the regulator is allowing Thames to recover through bills is too wide, they argue. The updated plan is unlikely to move the dial. Nor is it clear if Thames has met Ofwat’s demand for a new turnaround plan to bring robust management and governance. Ofwat will give its preliminary view on all water companies’ plans on 12 June, with a final decision due in December. Its allowances for the cost of capital could prove key in how investable the industry appears to its backers. Thames has said it has enough cash to continue operating until the summer of 2025. But a crunch may occur much sooner after Ofwat’s first salvo. If, at that point, new or existing shareholders still believe they cannot make a return over the next five-year period, then a scramble to secure its future could occur. Government plans for a temporary renationalisation continue apace. Thames’s latest efforts will have done little to dissuade Whitehall officials of the urgency of those plans.",

        "content": "The UK stock market has hit a record closing high, amid optimism that the Bank of England will cut interest rates twice this year, and easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks listed in London ended trading on Monday above its previous closing peak, set in February 2023, helped by rate cut hopes and a weakening pound. The index closed at 8,023 points, having jumped by 128 points, or 1.6%, on Monday. Its previous closing high was 8,014 points. This left the index shy of its all-time intraday high, also set in February 2023, when the index hit 8,047.06 points. Investor spirits in London were lifted by expectations that the Bank of England will lower interest rates by half a percentage point this year, down to 4.75% by December from the current 16-year high of 5.25%. The City money markets brought forward the likely timing of the first rate cut to August, from September, after the Bank’s deputy governor, Sir Dave Ramsden, predicted on Friday that UK inflation could be lower than expected over the next three years, and remain close to the Bank’s 2% target. The headline rate of inflation is now 3.2%. The pound weakened to $1.23 against the US dollar on Monday, the lowest since November. A weaker pound has supported share prices in London this year, as the lower currency makes the overseas earnings of multinational companies more valuable in sterling terms. Easing tensions in the Middle East also lifted investors’ confidence, after a weekend without further attacks between Iran and Israel after the Israeli missile attack on the Iranian cities of Isfahan and Tabriz on Friday. “The FTSE 100 bounced back strongly on Monday amid relief that tensions in the Middle East seem to have been contained for now,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell. “Travel and retail stocks were among the gainers on the FTSE 100, with precious metals miner Fresnillo the only stock showing notable weakness, with gold and silver prices dipping as demand for safe havens eased.” Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the FTSE 100 had “a spring in its step” at the start of the week amid an easing of geopolitical tensions. “London’s blue-chip index has had a surge of power as heightened geopolitical tensions have eased, and investors assessed the brighter prospects for the UK economy, with interest rate cuts spied on the horizon,” Streeter said. “The pulse of positivity comes in the absence of fresh retaliatory attacks by Israel or Iran and the US flexing its funding muscle and passing a crucial aid package for Ukraine.” The FTSE 100 index has gained almost 4% so far this year amid optimism that Britain’s economy has returned to growth in 2024 after dropping into a shallow recession at the end of 2023. That leaves it lagging behind other European indices, with France’s Cac and Germany’s Dax up 6.5% so far this year.",

        "title": "Thousands of flights to and from Europe affected by suspected Russian jamming",
        "content": "Flights in and out of Britain are among thousands that have been affected by suspected Russian jamming of GPS systems. More than 2,300 Ryanair flights have reported incidents of GPS interference since last August, according to a report, as well as almost 1,400 at Wizz Air, 82 at British Airways and four from easyJet. About 46,000 aircraft in total have logged problems with GPS over the Baltic Sea in the same time period, the Sun reported, based on analysis of flight logs with the website GPSJAM.org. Most of the GPS problems reported on the website have come in eastern Europe, bordering Russia. The satellite-based GPS forms part of an aircraft’s navigation system, and interference can pose a safety risk. The UK government confirmed in March that an RAF plane carrying the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, had its GPS signal jammed while flying near the Russian Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad, while heading back to the UK from Poland. Although Downing Street said the move did not threaten the safety of the aircraft, a defence source described it as “wildly irresponsible”. The International Air Transport Association and the EU Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) held a summit in January to discuss GPS jamming and “spoofing”, or sending bogus signals, with Easa reporting a sharp rise in the number of attacks. While Easa said countering the threat was a priority, the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority played down the risk and said jamming was often associated with military activity but did not mean commercial planes were being directly targeted. Glenn Bradley, the head of flight operations at the CAA, said: “Aviation is one of the safest forms of air travel and there are several safety protocols in place to protect navigation systems on commercial aircraft. “GPS jamming does not directly impact the navigation of an aircraft, and while it is a known issue, this does not mean an aircraft has been jammed deliberately.” A Ryanair spokesperson said: “In recent years there has been a rise in intermittent GPS interference which has affected all airlines. Ryanair aircraft have multiple systems to identify aircraft location, including GPS. If any of the location systems, such as GPS, are not functioning then the crew, as part of standard operating procedures, switch to one of the alternate systems.” An easyJet spokesperson said there were “multiple navigation systems onboard commercial aircraft as well as procedures in place which mitigate against issues with GPS that can occur for various reasons”. BA was approached for comment.",

        "title": "Royal Mail owner’s chair seeks to charm investors after Czech billionaire’s bid",
        "content": "The chair of Royal Mail’s owner is to conduct a charm offensive with investors in an attempt to convince them of its strategy, in the face of a potential £3.1bn hostile takeover by a Czech billionaire. Last week, it emerged that the postal firm’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS), had received a preliminary offer from Daniel Křetínský, an energy tycoon whose company, EP Group, is its largest shareholder. On Monday, IDS said its chair, the former British Airways boss Keith Williams, and its chief executive, Martin Seidenberg, would meet top investors this week. Williams said at the meetings bosses would “make clear why the possible offer from EP Group significantly undervalues IDS and is highly opportunistic”. Seidenberg is attempting to turn around the fortunes of the loss-making Royal Mail and continue to expand the group’s international parcels arm, GLS. It had been assumed that Křetínský wanted to carve out the profitable GLS and sell the business off, but he has denied that this is his plan. Křetínský, known as the “Czech Sphinx” for his low profile and inscrutable approach, is reportedly considering making an improved offer for IDS and has until 15 May to make a formal bid. The company’s management will hope to convince investors to share the view of Redwheel, its third-largest shareholder, which holds 6.65% of the shares. The manager of its investment told the Sunday Times it did not believe it was in the interests of shareholders, employees or customers for Royal Mail to be “broken up or sold off”. Redwheel piled pressure on the industry regulator, Ofcom, to allow reform of the universal service obligation (USO), which requires the 508-year-old Royal Mail to distribute nationwide for one price, six days a week. In an attempt to address the collapse in letter volumes over the past two decades, the watchdog laid out potential industry reforms this year, including allowing Royal Mail to cut the number of delivery days to five or even three a week. Rishi Sunak has said the government will oppose any cuts to the six-day service. Williams’ comments came as IDS submitted its detailed response to the potential overhaul. In a summary of its response, published this month, it asked the industry regulator to let it reduce deliveries of second-class letters to two or three days a week. The plan involves cutting almost 1,000 jobs and saving £300m a year by reducing daily delivery routes by 7,000-9,000. The company promised to retain a six-day-a-week service for first-class letters and seven days for parcels. The detailed plan included adding new reliability targets for first and second-class services and introducing tracking on parcels delivered under the USO. Williams said: “Today we have published the full detail behind our proposal for universal service reform. The proposal is based on detailed modelling and customer testing and does not require legislation. “The lack of universal service reform by government and Ofcom over the past four years has held back Royal Mail’s transformation and urgent action is needed. Reform is in the regulator’s hands and we urge Ofcom to accelerate their review.” IDS will publish its annual results on 23 May. Its shares rose more than 1% on Monday to 276p, still well below the 320p a share that EP Group has offered. Royal Mail was privatised in 2013 and split from the Post Office in the process. Křetínský, who also holds stakes in Sainsbury’s and West Ham United, bought into the company in 2020, benefiting from a pandemic-fuelled bump in its fortunes, and later ramped up his stake to 27.5%. In 2022, the government told Royal Mail it would study an increase in Křetínský’s stake under the National Security and Investment Act. However, that investigation was called off later in the year. Any future bid could still be examined by regulators. A spokesperson for Ofcom said: “We believe it’s important there’s a national debate, so everyone can have their say before we make any recommendations or proposals to secure its long-term future. “Under any scenario, Royal Mail must modernise its network, become more efficient and improve its service levels.”",

        "title": "FTSE 250 company Tyman snapped up by US rival in £788m deal",
        "content": "The London Stock Exchange’s mid-sized FTSE 250 index is due to lose a 186-year-old manufacturing company to a US takeover – the latest in a series of purchases by foreign buyers in recent years. Tyman, a FTSE 250 member that makes door and window components, will be bought by its US rival Quanex in a £788m cash and shares deal, the two companies announced on Monday. Yet another takeover by a US business will do nothing to assuage concerns about the gradual whittling down of the UK’s listed companies – small and large. One concern has been that UK firms are relatively undervalued compared with their American counterparts. That makes it easier for US companies to get a good deal when mounting takeovers. Other London-listed companies snapped up by US rivals include the FTSE 250 telecoms company Spirent, which is to be bought out for £1.2bn by the electronics testing company Keysight, and the FTSE 100 cardboard box maker DS Smith, which has agreed a £5.8bn deal with Tennessee-based International Paper. The struggling Hipgnosis Songs Fund is the subject of a bid battle between two US investors, while the self-storage group Lok’nStore was bought this month by Belgium’s Shurgard for £378m. Russ Mould, the investment director at the investment platform AJ Bell, said: “While individually this deal may not make much of a ripple, when you consider the sheer volume of firms being snapped up by overseas buyers, the UK market is experiencing death by a thousand cuts.” Tyman traces the oldest part of its business – the Era brand making door locks – back to 1838. It added the Schlegel door seals brand in 1885, and gradually added a series of companies making locks, handles and seals over the course of more than a century. However, the Tyman name is relatively new: it was chosen from the Old English word for “to turn” after the venerable manufacturing business was bought out by an investor, Lupus Capital, which then ran into trouble during the financial crisis of 2008. Monday’s takeover deal is at a 35% premium to Tyman’s share price at the close of trading on Friday. Tyman’s board recommended shareholders accept the Quanex offer. The 400p a share offer may be a premium to Tyman’s closing price but it is also short of the prices reached as recently as July 2022. Analysts at Peel Hunt, an investment bank, said it was “not a knockout offer” and suggested some investors could hold out for more. Nicky Hartery, the chair of Tyman, said: “In the context of a rapidly evolving North American marketplace, our board ultimately determined that this transaction is the best path to maximising value for Tyman shareholders, who will be able to realise a meaningful portion of their holding in cash at a significant premium to the prevailing share price while also participating in the future upside of the enlarged group.”",

        "title": "Thames Water could raise bills to £627 a year to help fix leaks",
        "content": "Thames Water could raise bills to as much as £627 a year to pay to fix its leaky network, after promising to invest up to £3bn more over the next five years. The embattled water supplier said on Monday that it had updated its spending plans for 2025 to 2030 after discussions with the industry regulator, Ofwat, and bills could rise as much as 44% under its most ambitious spending plans. The proposals to raise bills even further immediately drew anger from politicians and consumer groups, who argued that households struggling with the cost of living crisis should not have to pay for underinvestment in Thames’s creaking infrastructure. In October Thames submitted its business plan, known as a PR24, to Ofwat, pledging to spend £18.7bn over the period and raise bills by 40% to £610, or by 56% including inflation. The company has now said it will spend a further £1.1bn – totalling £19.8bn – to address environmental concerns over sewage dumping in the sector. Thames said it could spend £1.9bn on top of this – totalling £21.7bn over the period – depending on the availability of workers in its supply chain, which it would agree on an annual basis with Ofwat. If this occurred, bills for Thames’s 16 million customers would reach £627 by 2030, a 44% increase, excluding inflation. Thames did not specify exactly what the £1.1bn would be spent on. Industry sources said the bulk of the money would probably be spent ensuring the company could meet new statutory requirements to protect the environment set out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Thames is under intense scrutiny amid fears over its financial stability and questions over whether its shareholders are willing to pay upfront for its investments, before they are recovered from consumers through bills. The government is preparing plans in case the debt-laden company collapses, including renationalisation. The Guardian revealed last week that Whitehall contingency plans for a renationalisation could include adding the bulk of its £15.6bn debt to the public purse, with some lenders to its core operating company potentially losing up to 40% of their money. Thames said on Monday it had been able to up its spending without increasing bills on top of the original forecasts “due to a rebalancing of operating and capital expenditures”. The Thames Water chief executive, Chris Weston, said: “Our business plan focuses on our customers’ priorities. As part of the usual ongoing discussions relating to PR24, we’ve now updated it to deliver more projects that will benefit the environment. We will continue to discuss this with our regulators and stakeholders.” Shareholders said last month they were not willing to put in a promised £500m while a standoff between Thames and Ofwat continued. It is understood that Monday’s update has not changed the view of shareholders. Last month they claimed that Ofwat had “not been prepared to provide the necessary regulatory support” for Thames’s business plan. The Guardian revealed last week that Thames was considering issuing more debt to help fund its plans, adding to its £15.6bn debt pile. Mike Keil, the chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said: “On the surface the proposal for more investment from Thames Water is a positive step for its customers that have endured some of the worst customer service in the sector. “We should not lose sight of the fact that only 16% of its customers thought the company’s proposed bill rises in its five-year plan were affordable. This announcement appears to offer nothing to ease the fears of those already struggling to pay.” The Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney, said: “It would be an absolute disgrace if customers are forced to foot the bill for Thames Water’s shambolic failings. Ofwat cannot allow these bill hikes to go ahead.” Ofwat is due to give its provisional verdict on Thames’s business plan, and those of its peers, on 12 June and publish final decisions in December. In the submission to Ofwat, the company said it was discussing its “green economy recovery” plan (GER) with the regulator. The ailing programme, drawn up in the pandemic, was supposed to allow Thames to add £72m to bills to fund a smart meter rollout in the Thames Valley. The company said extreme weather in 2022 had hurt the “achievability” of hitting its targets, and discussions with Ofwat would “determine if we can proceed with the GER programme”.",

        "title": "Tesco accused of undercutting local shops via its wholesale business",
        "content": "Village shopkeepers say Tesco is consistently undercutting them by selling products for less in its stores than via its wholesale business Booker, stoking concerns about the power of the UK’s biggest supermarket chain. Tesco, which has 27% of the UK grocery market, bought the cash-and-carry group in 2017 for £3.7bn, promising that the deal would benefit shoppers and independent retailers. But independent shopkeepers who are clients of Booker claim that out of a list of 50 items stocked by the UK’s biggest wholesaler – compiled from retailer invoices and online order screenshots – about a quarter are cheaper on Tesco’s shelves. That includes five items on offer via the supermarket’s Clubcard Prices loyalty discount scheme. Examples include: a bottle of Innocent orange juice, which had a wholesale price of £2.25 in Booker but could be bought for £2 in Tesco by Clubcard holders; Rubicon sparkling mango juice, which had a wholesale price of 39p a can in Booker versus 37p in Tesco or 33p for Clubcard holders; seedless grapes for a wholesale price of £3.98 a kg in Booker compared with £3.60 in its parent group’s supermarket; and an iceberg lettuce that had a wholesale price of 95p, against 79p in Tesco. Many other items were sold with prices printed on their labels that ensured that they would be sold for more in the independent shops than in Tesco’s stores. While it is not unusual for small shops to charge more than supermarkets because of the higher relative costs of running an independent outlet, shop owners said the focus on price-marked products reduced choice for them at Booker. One retailer said: “When Tesco have things on offer, or at Tesco Clubcard price, they are hugely cheaper than we pay. Easter eggs are a very good example of this, as are things like big tubs of [chocolates] at Christmas time – the recommended retail price from Bookers is often double what you would pay in a Tesco store.” Another said: “When Tesco bought Booker in 2017, I’m sure there were comments saying that Tesco would use its combined buying power to benefit Booker customers. This certainly doesn’t seem to have happened. Pricing is pretty similar.” A third retailer said: “Every year it’s got worse since the Tesco takeover. Tesco have cheaper prices and more stock than Booker branches.” A further independent retailer said Tesco was “selling items that are cheaper on Tesco Clubcard than they are at Booker”, such as tubs of chocolates at Christmas. “It often seems that when items are out of stock at Booker, when you go to Tesco, they have stands of them at special offer.” Another retailer listed further examples of products that cost her more in Booker than in her local Tesco, including Robertson’s Golden Shred marmalade for £2.14 against £1.80 in Tesco, Heinz baked beans at £1.16 against £1 for Tesco Clubcard holders, and Ambrosia Devon Custard for £1.22 against £1 in the supermarket. She said Tesco was “taking their influence on independents even further and no doubt will again be left unchallenged”. A Booker spokesperson said: “We work very hard to offer our retail customers the best choice, price and service. Our price position versus the wholesale market is extremely competitive, and in the last year we have welcomed 354 net new retail partners, with retail customer satisfaction up 6% to 82%. “The balance we try to strike is making sure we have the keenest prices, the best availability and the right range, allowing our retailers to grow their businesses and gain sales on leading market trends. We continue to invest in our retail business to serve our retailers better.” Booker is understood to benchmark its prices against other wholesalers, which it aims to undercut, and the Tesco supermarket has no input in setting prices. Last month the Guardian reported complaints from village stores that accused Tesco of using its cash-and-carry arm to “squeeze” them out of business by restricting supplies and deliveries of groceries. Independent retailers, many of which also run local post offices in remote rural locations, have said that a series of changes recently introduced by Booker were adding to pressures at a time when some villages had been left with just one small shop or none at all. They claim Booker has reduced the range of items available by up to 30% at some sites, withdrawn customer favourites including Yorkshire Tea and Colman’s mustard, and reduced the availability and reliability of deliveries. One rival wholesale competitor said it was seeing an influx of independent retailers who had become disgruntled by their treatment by Booker. “Headline prices are very competitive, but the cost of service – charges for deliveries, the level of [discounts for buying large volumes] – [is getting worse],” they said. The UK’s competition watchdog did not comment on whether it was prepared to step in to examine the grocery wholesale market. However, the Competition and Markets Authority is taking a strong interest in grocery inflation and is already examining whether loyalty card discount schemes – including Tesco’s Clubcard system – are having a detrimental effect on the grocery market.",

        "content": "Instead of throwing stained, ripped and misshapen clothing in the bin, Britons are being asked to stick the dregs of their wardrobe in the post in a trial aimed at tackling the “staggering” quantity of textiles sent to landfill or incinerated each year. A third of consumers do not know what to do with tops, dresses and trousers that can no longer be worn, figures show, with a similar number admitting to putting such items in their household waste bin. Now unwearable clothes from any label can be returned in a prepaid postal donation bag left with a courier as part of the experimental tie-up between Marks &amp; Spencer and Oxfam, which runs alongside its existing scheme for wearable items. Katharine Beacham, M&amp;S’s head of materials, sustainability and packaging, said the scheme made it possible for someone to clear out all their unloved clothing in one go. “Whether it is wearable or unwearable, we want it all,” she said. M&amp;S and the charity have for a number of years been working together on the “shwopping” initiative, in which customers drop off old clothing in exchange for loyalty card perks. However, the postal scheme, which is being paid for out of a new £1m accelerator fund linked to the retailer’s ethical project Plan A, is part of a wider push to find ways to reduce textile waste. Research suggests the UK’s wardrobes contain 1.6bn items of unworn clothing. The bags can be ordered on the Oxfam website, and individuals are asked to enclose unwearable items in a separate sack. With a fifth of consumers telling M&amp;S they did not know how to discriminate on wearability, the anti-waste charity Wrap stresses that “wearable” clothing is clean, dry, in good condition and ready to be worn. “Unwearable” items are damaged in some way, for instance torn, stained, faded, or stretched. Consumers can also use the service to donate preloved soft furnishings such as bed linen, towels, cushions, tablecloths and tea towels. However, the M&amp;S in-store “shwopping” scheme continues to be for wearable, hand-me-down quality clothing only. Individuals are asked not to include soiled or contaminated clothing as it cannot be recycled. Still wearable donations will be sold through Oxfam’s stores and website, while the “unwearables” will be responsibly recycled by a UK Fashion and Textile Association (UKFT) project. It is working on a blueprint for an advanced textile sorting and pre-processing (ATSP) centre that would be capable of turning clothing unsuitable for resale into new garments, resulting in a completely circular system. Adam Mansell, the chief executive of UKFT, said urgent action was needed to tackle the “staggering amount” of textile waste that ended up in landfill or incinerated each year. “We’re aiming to encourage people to separate their items so that in future, worn-out clothing can make its way to an automated sorting facility and then be recycled into new textiles and garments here in the UK,” he said.",

        "title": "Sharp rise in Aim delistings casts doubt over City of London’s future",
        "content": "The number of companies delisting from London’s junior stock market has risen sharply in the last year, adding to concerns about the future of the City’s financial sector. In the past 12 months the number of companies on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) has fallen by 70 to 738 at the end of March, according to London Stock Exchange Group data. That is a drop of 9%, and is significantly more than the drop of 25 companies the year before. The London Stock Exchange Group runs Aim, which gives smaller companies the option to raise funds on the stock market without having to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements for listing on the main market. However, the market’s status as a place for companies to grow rapidly has come under scrutiny in recent years, with the number of companies falling from almost 1,700 in 2007. Two small biotech companies, Redx and C4X Discovery, said this month they would delist because they believe they can raise more money as private companies. Scirocco Energy, a green energy investor, said it would leave the market because of high costs to comply with listing requirements. Other companies have exited because of takeovers, such as the retailer Hotel Chocolat and the asset manager Gresham House. The increase in delisting comes at a time when a number of big companies have said they are considering moving from the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Wael Sawan, the chief executive of Shell, caused alarm among investors this month by saying that the oil company was undervalued compared with peers in the US. The grocery delivery company Ocado is also under pressure from unnamed investors to shift its listing from London to New York, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The focus on the LSE’s fortunes comes in the wake of a series of lost business. The chip designer Arm – one of the few world-leading tech companies to have grown in the UK – floated shares on New York’s Nasdaq exchange in September last year despite intense lobbying by the UK government. The building materials company CRH last year shifted its main stock market listing to the US, following in the footsteps of the plumbing and heating supplier Ferguson. The Anglo-German tourism company Tui is also considering shifting its main listing away from London, this time in favour of Frankfurt. Departures from the stock market are expected as companies fail or are bought up. However, an increase in delistings could cause problems if they are not replaced, and only one company has joined Aim in 2024, after 10 joined in 2023. A shrinking market would be less attractive to potential investors in companies. Marcus Stuttard, the head of Aim and UK primary markets at the London Stock Exchange Group, said: “Aim continues to be a pre-eminent global growth market and the most active in Europe. That position is not taken for granted and the comprehensive reform agenda currently under way will build on the existing strengths of the UK’s capital markets including Aim.” Colin Wright, the chair of UHY Hacker Young, argued that some companies may have been put off keeping an Aim listing because of new reporting requirements, including on environmental, social and governance issues. Extra costs can be difficult for the smallest growth companies hoping to list. “An Aim listing is meant to be relatively low cost and light touch in terms of regulation,” he said. “The challenge Aim now faces is to strike the balance between continuing to enforce high regulatory standards and creating a compliance culture that is flexible enough that it motivates businesses to remain listed.”",

        "content": "A permanent shift to higher interest rates could add billions of pounds to the UK’s renewable energy transition, a leading thinktank has warned. Borrowing costs have soared since the easing of pandemic lockdowns and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as the world’s leading central banks raised interest rates to tackle inflation – pushing up the costs of investment in infrastructure across advanced economies including for green power generation schemes. The Resolution Foundation said £29bn a year could therefore be added to household energy bills in 2050 in a scenario where interest rates persist at current elevated levels, relative to a situation where borrowing costs return to pre-pandemic levels. However, it said the green transition would still save consumers billions of pounds compared with current sky-high energy costs, and slowing down the pace of transition was not an option. The thinktank said a fourfold increase in investment in the UK’s power sector was required to provide the crucial next step in decarbonising the British economy, and a plan was needed to fund this investment in case interest rates stayed at current high levels. Its report comes amid a pushback against green policies by rightwing politicians who argue the costs of hitting net zero are too high. Labour earlier this year slashed its green investment plans amid concerns over higher borrowing costs and a campaign by the Conservatives to weaponise the affordability of its £28bn price tag. However, the Resolution Foundation said the green transition remained vital despite the higher costs of investment. Decarbonising the power sector is key to tackling global heating, it said, and would also help to reduce Britain’s dependence on volatile fossil fuel supplies, which risked exposing households to global energy shocks of the kind witnessed after the Russian invasion. “Responding by pausing or slowing the pace of power sector decarbonisation is not an option,” the report said. The government is committed to reaching net zero by 2050, with targets to decarbonise the power sector by 2035, and Labour promising to reach this goal five years earlier. The report, Electric Dreams, outlined two scenarios for future costs by 2050: a “high-cost” one with global interest rates remaining at current levels, and a “low-cost” alternative where borrowing costs fall back to pre-Covid levels. Compared with energy bills in 2023 – which are at a historically high cost – it said decarbonising the power sector would still save £14bn a year for households by 2050. However, larger savings of up to £47bn a year would be possible if interest rates returned to the levels seen in 2019. However, in comparison with 2019 levels – before the spike in wholesale energy markets – it said household bills would be £11bn a year higher by 2050 in the high-cost scenario. If interest rates fell back to levels comparable with 2019, households would save £18bn a year – a difference of £29bn between the two scenarios. The report called for a focus on keeping prices low when providing new investment, including pushing for the development of onshore wind – which can be cheaper than other renewable alternatives. It said some projects could be publicly funded, such as modernising the energy grid, because paying for investment via taxation – rather than through energy bills – could help to spread the costs more fairly across rich and poor households. It also called for the government to introduce a social tariff for lower-income households, which could help to protect poorer households who are high energy users in particular. Jonathan Marshall, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said policymakers could not count on interest rates falling back to pre-pandemic levels in future. “If interest rates stay high, energy costs will rise rather than fall in the years ahead,” he said. “So now is the time for planning on how we deliver the energy investment surge while protecting lower income households, with a greater focus on price reduction in contracts, price protection for vulnerable households, and rethinking the role of the state as an investor.”",

        "title": "Thames Water-linked firm paid £14m in dividends despite concerns over group",
        "content": "A development company that sells off land no longer needed by Thames Water has paid out a £14m dividend despite warnings that it could become engulfed by the water group’s financial woes. Accounts filed at Companies House show Kennet Properties paid out a £14.5m dividend in the year to 31 March 2023 despite the difficulties faced by the wider group, which is facing going into administration. The water group, which has an £18bn debt burden, is fighting for survival amid a standoff with the industry watchdog, Ofwat, and the government. The Guardian revealed on Thursday that ministers were considering a nationalisation plan that would add most of its £15.6bn debt to the public purse. Thames, which has faced a public outcry over sewage dumping, needs to invest in its leaky infrastructure but hopes to raise consumer bills significantly to pay for it. Kennet takes on land no longer needed by Britain’s biggest water company before developing it and selling it on, typically for housing or commercial premises. It also received income for the use of sewer networks by third parties for fibre-optic cabling. Within Thames Water’s complex corporate structure, Kennet sits outside the ringfenced operating company, which is regulated by Ofwat. Its immediate parent is Thames Water Limited, and it is ultimately controlled by the group’s struggling parent, Kemble Water. Kemble warned this month that it would not be able to pay back a £190m loan due at the end of April, after shareholders said last month that Thames was “uninvestable” due to Ofwat’s stringent approach. Kemble later missed an interest payment and it is feared that the company could collapse. Thames has said this would not affect its 16 million customers. Both Thames Water and a group of lenders to Kemble have hired their own law firms as they prepare for a potential battle over a restructuring and any resulting losses for investors, the Daily Telegraph reported on Saturday. In the accounts, Kennet noted that if Kemble defaults, debt holders may “enact their right to enforce their pledge over the shares” in its parent, “resulting in a potential change in ownership of the company”. Jonathan Mogg, a Kennet director, said: “In the event of a change of ownership, the directors are unaware of the future intentions of the new owners. These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. “However, with regard to the cashflow forecast, and after considering its current cash balance and other assets … the directors have a reasonable expectation that Kennet will continue operating for at least 12 months.” Mogg said that Kennet had sought legal advice and that it was not reliant on other companies in the group to continue trading. Auditors at PwC – which has issued warnings about the future of Kemble – signed off the accounts. Kennet said it had £1.2m in cash and that, in a worst-case scenario, it could use this cash, sell parcels of land for development at auction or not renew an agreement, introduced last year and due to end in June, whereby a third party company collects income for the use of the sewer network. The accounts, filed more than 12 months after the end of Kennet’s financial year, showed that the company made a £1.15m pre-tax profit for the year to 31 March 2023, up from £374,000 a year earlier. Revenues rose to £1.6m in 2023 – up from £1m in 2022 – comprised of £735,000 from property sales and £858,000 from sewer network income. The Guardian revealed last year that Ofwat was investigating a separate internal dividend payment of £37.5m, made by Thames Water’s operating company to Kemble last year. Kemble relies on payments from group companies to service its debts, and Thames has not paid out a dividend to its external shareholders since 2017. Sources close to Kemble said the Kennet dividend had ultimately been paid to another group company, the floating solar project developer Trinzic Energy. Kennet said that it expected to continue focusing on selling off land for residential and commercial use and also “explore commercial options” for the use of sewer networks by third parties for further fibre-optic cabling. Kemble and Thames Water declined to comment.",

        "title": "Most difficult global outlook since 1930s heralds end of US-led world order | Larry Elliott",
        "content": "The 2020s are almost halfway over and are on course to be the most difficult decade for the global economy since the 1930s. Every finance minister and central bank governor at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington last week knows that, even if they were not prepared to admit it publicly. The IMF likes to look on the bright side. It revised up slightly its forecast for global growth and now thinks scarring from the coronavirus pandemic and the cost of living crisis will be less severe than it originally feared. Interest rates have risen without triggering the recessions that were predicted. A soft landing has been finessed. The performance of some countries – the US and India to take two examples – has been strong. This analysis is only true up to a point. There has been plenty of scarring in the poorest and weakest countries, and in the developed world the US is the outlier, with performance markedly worse in Europe. Medium-term growth prospects remain poor. The big cloud hanging over the gatherings of the IMF and the World Bank was the possibility that Iran’s missile attack on Israel would lead to a full-blown conflict and have the same deleterious impact on the global economy as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. For now, those fears have not materialised. Israel duly retaliated with missile strikes of its own but Tehran and Tel Aviv seem keen to avoid all-out war. Oil prices rose but not by much. There has been no repeat of 1973, when the Yom Kippur war led to a more than fourfold increase in the cost of crude, amplifying already strong inflationary pressures in the west. The global economy could do without a repeat either of 2022 or 1973 because the battle against inflation is not going quite as smoothly as it seemed to be a couple of months back. Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, has responded to higher than expected price pressures by hinting there would be a delay in US interest rates coming down. A few months back there was talk on Wall Street of six or seven cuts in US interest rates this year. Now it is conceivable there will be none at all. Meanwhile, the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, said the profile of UK inflation was unbalanced, with big falls in household energy bills offset by service sector inflation of 6%. Threadneedle Street sees service sector inflation as a good guide to cost pressures being generated by the domestic economy. It will want to see further easing of that pressure before cutting rates from their current level of 5.25%. So, it’s obvious why the IMF is monitoring events in the Middle East carefully and with some trepidation. The global economy has only just come out of intensive care and badly needs a period of calm in order to recover. It could do without the damage that oil prices soaring to well over $100 (£81) would provide in the event that the Middle East takes a turn for the worse. As it happens, there was more focus in Washington last week on the war in Ukraine than there was on what might happen in the Middle East. The US Congress agreed to a new aid package for Kyiv, while the G7 is looking at ways of using the interest on seized Russian assets to support Ukraine. The reality is that Russia’s economy has stood up far better to sanctions than was predicted two years ago. The IMF has revised up its growth forecast for Russia this year and next. In part that is because of the increase in industrial production needed for the war, but it is also because Russia has found plenty of customers for its energy exports. The war has highlighted and widened the gulf between the wealthy countries of the global north and the big emerging countries of the global south. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said support for Ukraine remained “steady and firm” but that was not really the case. Kyiv is backed by the G7 countries but not by many big emerging economies such as South Africa. The G7 has made a stand in Ukraine but not over equally brutal – but less well-covered – wars in the developing world. When the G7 asks for a show of solidarity to oppose Russian aggression, they ask where the solidarity was during the pandemic, when rich countries took the lion’s share of the vaccines. They want to know why G7 countries have cut their aid budgets and why a debt crisis has been allowed to fester. They have a point on all counts. In truth, not a lot happened in Washington last week. There was the usual flurry of reports but not much else. Beneath the surface, however, something much more important is going on, and that is the breakup of the US-dominated form of globalisation. The model involved western companies outsourcing manufacturing to China and other low-cost destinations, and for a while it delivered cheap goods, which kept inflation low and made life easy for central banks. Those days are now over. The US and Europe want to protect jobs by limiting imports of Chinese goods and subsidising their own manufacturing sectors. Only last week, Joe Biden called for a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel in a move designed to appeal to blue-collar workers in swing states. This is not the first time this has happened. The pre-first world war era of globalisation fell apart as a result of war, a pandemic, inflation and protectionism. Little by little, history is repeating itself.",

        "content": "One of the top investors in Royal Mail’s owner has said it is vulnerable to “corporate predators”, arguing that a recent takeover bid by a Czech billionaire significantly undervalues the company. Redwheel called for regulators to water down the UK postal service’s legal obligations after Daniel Křetínský’s failed takeover attempt of its parent company International Distributions Services (IDS). It emerged last week that the IDS board had unanimously rejected a £3.1bn bid by Křetínský’s EP Group earlier this month, calling it “opportunistic”. Křetínský is considering making an improved offer for IDS, according to reports, and has until 15 May to make a fresh bid under UK takeover rules. Royal Mail has been under pressure for years as the volume of letters continues to decline. The UK regulator, Ofcom, is considering options for the future of the service, including letting it cut the number of days it must deliver letters under its universal service obligations (USO). The USO was well known to the investors who bought shares in Royal Mail when it was privatised in 2013. However, many of the investors now argue that the legal requirement to deliver post across the country at a fixed price every day bar Sunday is unsustainable. Rishi Sunak has said the government will oppose any cuts to the six-day service but Royal Mail has asked Ofcom to allow it to reduce second-class letter deliveries to two or three days a week, cutting almost 1,000 jobs and saving £300m a year. Redwheel is the third-largest shareholder in IDS, behind Křetínský’s investment vehicle Vesa and Schroders. Ian Lance, a co-head of Redwheel’s value and income team, said in a statement first reported by the Sunday Times that it believed Royal Mail was “vulnerable to corporate predators” because of enforced costs caused by its legal obligations. “Letter volumes have declined from 20bn at their peak in 2004-5 to 7bn in the last financial year and are likely to continue to fall,” Lance said. “The USO means Royal Mail must maintain a high fixed-cost network without the revenue to sustain it. “We would urge that change to the USO needs to be meaningful, provide long-term relief from the material and unreasonable cost burden and be implemented rapidly.” Křetínský’s wealth came from his investments in coal power stations, and is known as the “Czech Sphinx” of his low profile and inscrutable approach. However, he has gained increasing prominence by buying stakes in Le Monde newspaper, Sainsbury’s supermarket and the French counterpart Casino, and then Royal Mail. He also has a stake in West Ham football club. EP Group was approached for comment.",

        "title": "World Bank official calls for shake-up of G20 debt relief scheme",
        "content": "The mechanism for providing debt relief to the world’s poorest countries is failing to produce results and requires a major rethink, a senior official at the World Bank has said. Indermit Gill, the bank’s chief economist, said that after four years the G20’s common framework – designed to speed up and simplify debt restructuring – had not provided a single dollar of new money. More than half the 75 countries deemed poor enough to be eligible for concessional finance from the World Bank are either in distress or close to it, and Gill said cripplingly high repayments were entrenching poverty. Interviewed by the Guardian at the bank’s spring meetings in Washington, Gill said: “We have to recognise the problems. The common framework won’t deliver what leaders say it will. They are saying: ‘This horse is not dead yet, so let’s just keep whipping it.’” He said a key weakness of the common framework was that private bondholders – an increasingly important group of creditors – were only brought in at the end of debt negotiations. He said lessons should be learned from the blueprint drawn up in the 1980s by the then US treasury secretary, Nicholas Brady, to deal with a previous debt crisis. The Brady plan provided a systematic approach to debt relief, ensured private creditors were part of the process from the start, and involved creditors accepting losses in return for assurances about the ability of debtor countries’ capacity to repay. So far, only a handful of countries – including Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana and Zambia – have applied for debt relief through the common framework, and Gill was withering in his criticism of the flagship initiative created in 2020 by the G20 group of leading developed and developing countries. “The common framework is not working. If the money from debt relief was coming in dribs and drabs, I would say OK, but there hasn’t been a single dollar of debt relief from the common framework.” Gill said another weakness of the common framework was that its secretariat was the Paris Club – a group of 20-plus creditor countries mostly in the developed west. China – which has become a major creditor – is not a member and has refused to be forced into accepting terms agreed by the Paris Club. “You can’t have the Paris Club playing in the casino with Chinese money,” Gill said. Failure to come up with a workable debt framework was putting back development by years, the bank’s chief economist added. “Countries are deterred from going through the common framework because they won’t get access to financial markets and they won’t get debt relief.” Although the IMF said last week that the global economy was on course for a “soft landing”, Gill said he did not accept the argument that the world had “dodged a bullet”. A few countries – the US, China, India and Indonesia – were doing well but other G7 countries were struggling, he said. “For low-income countries, things are terrible.” Gill said the problems of heavy indebtedness would not go away, and expressed scepticism that burdens would ease as interest rates came down in the US. “Tightening cycles last years, not months. These countries will continue to face very high debt-servicing costs.” He said debt payments were forcing low-income countries to cut back on spending on health, education and investment. “That’s not sustainable according to me.” The IMF takes a more positive view of the common framework, and thinks debt problems would be even worse had it not been set up. Its Africa director, Abebe Selassie, said at a press briefing last week that debt restructuring was a painful and lengthy process. “Without the common framework we wouldn’t have made the progress we have in helping Zambia and Ghana towards debt sustainability.”",

        "content": "The troubled owner of music back catalogues ranging from Beyoncé to Neil Young has said it would accept a takeover offer from Blackstone, after the private equity investor revealed it was considering outbidding a rival rights owner’s deal. Hipgnosis Songs Fund (HSF) launched a strategic review after a turbulent period on the London Stock Exchange, and now faces the prospect of a takeover contest after saying on Sunday it would back Blackstone’s approach over last week’s agreement with Concord Music. The US rights investor, which owns or administers about 1m musical works for artists ranging from Phil Collins to Cyndi Lauper, had agreed a $1.4bn (£1.1bn) takeover deal on Thursday. However, on Saturday, Blackstone said it was considering a counteroffer worth $1.5bn. Hipgnosis was founded in 2018 by Merck Mercuriadis, the former manager of acts including Elton John, Iron Maiden, Guns N’ Roses and Beyoncé. Hipgnosis spent millions buying the streaming rights of a succession of famous musicians. The sales provided the artists with an immediate payout on their hits rather than waiting for the streaming revenues over the years. Hipgnosis’s business model relied on using the future streaming revenues to pay a steady income to shareholders. However, it was derailed by rising interest rates and changes to the valuation of its songs, leading to turmoil and shareholder rebellion, with its investors voting in October against continuing the struggling fund in its then form. HSF said on Sunday said it had “indicated to Blackstone” that the proposal was at “a value that it would be minded to recommend to its shareholders should Blackstone announce a firm intention to make an offer”. However, the company said there was no certainty that Blackstone would confirm its proposed bid. Until a firm offer comes on to the table, Hipgnosis said it continued to recommend the Concord deal to shareholders. Saturday’s proposal is not the first time that Blackstone has tried to take ownership of Hipgnosis assets. In September, Hipgnosis agreed to sell part of its catalogue to a partnership between Blackstone and Mercuriadis, only for shareholders to vote down the deal and force HSF into the strategic review. The situation is further complicated by the fraught relationship between HSF and Hipgnosis Songs Management (HSM), a company that was set up as the manager and investment adviser to HSF but which was removed by shareholders. Blackstone owns a stake in HSM. Blackstone said HSM had an option to buy the Hipgnosis assets for six months after the end of the investment adviser agreement. On Saturday, Blackstone threatened legal action if Hipgnosis proceeded with the Concord deal and prevented HSM from buying the songs. Blackstone said it and HSM remained “confident in the enforceability of the option”, and that it would “vigorously defend HSM’s rights pursuant to the option if required to do so”. Concord Music was approached for comment.",

        "content": "Consumer prices ticked up again in March, rising to anywhere from 3.2% to 3.8% year-over-year, depending on the rate you’re tracking. Of course, that’s way down from what it was back in 2022. But don’t tell that to any of my clients – or people running businesses in just about every industry across the country. For them, prices are not only rising but are significantly – significantly! – higher than they were when Joe Biden took office. Want some examples? If you’re in the manufacturing business, you’re paying 11% more for plastics and resins, 24% more for industrial gases, 23% higher prices for machinery and equipment, 35% additional cash for the oil and grease that lubricates those machines, and 18% more for industrial chemicals (which get used in just about everything) since 2021. Overall, your total costs of manufacturing are 26% higher than they were just three years ago. In the construction business the good news is that lumber prices have actually fallen 25% since 2021. But that’s been more than offset by a rise in iron and steel (27%), cement and concrete (42%), and staples, nails, spikes and tacks (21%). Overall, construction materials costs have increased about 30% since the last inauguration. My clients in the food manufacturing and service industries are also feeling the pain. Food manufacturing costs have risen 24% since 2021, the cost of fertilizer is up 34% and animal feeds are up 10%. Now do you understand why restaurant owners are struggling to stay in business and have resorted to adding surcharges for credit card and other fees? Once you make any of your products, you’ll be paying 8% more for domestic freight and a whopping 49% more to ship or receive stuff overseas. Packaging all your products with paperboard boxes and other components will also cost you 38% more than it did three years ago. Since 2021, hourly wages are up 16% and health and property insurance rates are up 8% to 10%. And interest costs have quadrupled, with most of my clients paying two to three points over the 8.5% prime rate. This didn’t happen overnight. It’s taken a few years. For businesses around the country, today’s inflation isn’t the problem. The dramatic rise in just about every core material and overhead cost that it takes to make and deliver products and services? Yeah, that’s the real problem. None of this is news to anyone running a business. I share this information with associations and business groups representing industries from all over and the audience just nods their heads in solemn agreement (before heading to the bar). All you have to do is look at the most recent survey from the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which places small business optimism at an 11-year low, to realize how deep this problem goes. So what can businesses do about this? Of course they raise prices (although my smartest clients are doing this discriminately by looking closely at customer profitability and targeting price increases where they can). Businesses are also investing more in technology and capital improvements, although many are being hindered by the much higher costs of capital. Other tactics you’ve probably seen: shrinkflation, where businesses charge the same for less (what? only two meatballs instead of three with my spaghetti?), tougher negotiations, pushing back on added goodies (I haven’t seen a chocolate on my hotel pillow since well before Covid) and a pullback on hiring, with job openings now at a pre-Covid level. Inflation is still a major problem. Consumers are getting pinched with higher prices and stagnant incomes. Meanwhile, small businesses – which employ half of the country’s workers – are dealing with significantly higher costs. All of this has happened since Biden took office. Is this his fault? History will decide. Regardless, it explains why the president’s approval ratings are so low. And it doesn’t bode well for him this election year.",

        "content": "The water industry regulator has spent £26.7m on business consultants in the past five years, including several companies that have simultaneously worked for private water firms, the Observer can reveal. The findings prompted environmental campaigner Feargal Sharkey to call for Ofwat to be abolished as fellow campaigners said there appeared to be no dividing line between “those who are meant to enforce the law and those who routinely break it”. The Observer analysed invoices paid to Ofwat’s private sector suppliers from 2019 to the first three months of 2024, collated by procurement specialists Tussell. The firm that received by far the most income from Ofwat over that period was PwC – which netted more than £11.5m, almost half the total. PwC audits the accounts of Thames Water, which submitted plans last week to raise bills by 56% over the next five years, as well as providing services to the wider sector. In a document sent to potential industry clients in 2013, the firm said its “leading role in professional and standard-setting organisations puts us in an ideal position to advise on regulatory, operating effectiveness and other developments”. Several of the other consultancy companies used by Ofwat advertise their services working for the water industry on their websites. In March it was revealed that raw sewage was discharged into waterways for 3.6m hours in 2023 by England’s privatised water firms, more than double the figure in 2022. At the core of the issue has been claims that water companies have invested too little in infrastructure while paying huge dividends to shareholders. The water industry has paid shareholders £78bn in dividends in the just over three decades since it was privatised, while amassing £64bn of debt, despite being debt-free when sold to the private sector. “What we’re looking at right now is nothing more than the physical manifestation of three decades of political neglect, regulatory failure and corporate greed,” said Sharkey. “Ofwat needs to be abolished, and it needs to happen today,” he added. “The whole of the regulatory system of the water industry needs dismantling and utter reform, as do those companies that have milked us for nearly £80bn worth of cash, leaving over £60bn of debt behind them. “The truth is we need to point the finger at the regulator, who simply wasn’t up to it, wasn’t capable and has to go.” Surfers Against Sewage chief executive, Giles Bristow said: “The regulators have already been exposed for schmoozing water industry fat cats at exclusive members clubs and now this - is there anything that divides those who are meant to enforce the law and those who routinely break it? “For people across the country, who are rightly furious about the sewage being dumped into our rivers and seas, this is a bad look at a bad time for a supposedly expert independent body. “It’s time for Ofwat to get their house in order and put clear water between themselves and our scandal-ravaged water industry, because, right now, the picture looks very murky indeed.” An Ofwat spokesperson said PwC was its “main delivery partner” during its price review process – where Ofwat outlines the maximum water companies can charge to users and service standards for the industry. The spokesperson said the firm delivered “additional technical expertise in areas such as financial modelling, economics and engineering”. They added that a “rigorous conflict procedure” ensured that “any potential conflicts of interest were identified and managed appropriately”. A spokesperson for PwC said the firm adheres “strictly to all regulatory, professional, ethical and independence standards”, and has no “decision-making responsibility” in its services to Ofwat.",

        "title": "End times for the UK’s final coal-fired power station",
        "content": "From the northernmost reaches of the River Soar in Nottinghamshire, the towers of Britain’s last coal-fired power station emerge from the flat countryside like concrete monuments to another time. For more than half a century Ratcliffe-on-Soar has burned millions of tonnes of coal to generate the electricity needed to power the British economy. But one by one Britain’s coal power stations have closed, leaving Ratcliffe the sole survivor. In less than six months it, too, will finally power down for good, extinguishing the last embers of the once-mighty coal industry. With its last winter behind it, the sprawling site, which covers the same acreage as the City of London, is quiet save for the hum of a single turbine and the crackle of electricity power lines overhead. It once employed up to 3,000 people, but now a total of about 350 engineers are working there, in shifts, as Ratcliffe ekes out its final months, unsure of how many hours the site has left to run before it closes around the end of September. “Last Saturday night was my last night shift,” says Ian Jackson, a shift leader at the site. “I’ve worked night shifts for the past 30 years. In that time, I’ve become a father and a grandfather. My family has only ever known me as a shift worker.” Jackson was on duty in January this year, when Ratcliffe was called upon to fire up all four of its generating units and supply extra power as an icy Arctic blast chilled the country. It was almost definitely the last time the plant will run at full capacity. Jackson was also there earlier this month, when the first of these units was put into “preservation”, awaiting the plant’s final shutdown. “It was the quietest I’ve ever seen the team,” he says. “You could see people reflecting on the moment. There were quite a few lifers there, but it was emotional for all of us. What it will be like for us when it does close, I can’t imagine.” ‘The end of the first Industrial Revolution’ When Ratcliffe was opened in 1968 by the Central Electricity Generating Board, the very first series of Dad’s Army was about to be broadcast, the Beatles were topping the charts and coal power was in its heyday. Coal-fired stations mushroomed through Britain’s mining heartlands in the late 1960s and 1970s to provide baseload power for Britain’s electricity network. The 2,000-megawatt Ratcliffe broke up the skyline for drivers on the new M1 motorway, and provided power to heat and light 2m homes. It was built in an area rich in coal, where collieries employing tens of thousands of miners dotted the landscape. By the early 1980s, Ratcliffe was burning 65% of south Nottinghamshire’s coal output. The new power stations were built at speed. At the time, their scale and engineering complexity were unprecedented, and their impact on the climate unforeseen. When Ratcliffe generates its last megawatts this year, it will represent the final dismantling of Britain’s coal heritage and end almost 150 years of coal-powered economic growth. “It’s the end of the first Industrial Revolution, really,” says engineering manager Nigel Bates. He first stepped on to the Ratcliffe site more than 40 years ago, as a 16-year-old mechanical apprentice with a handful of O-levels. “Coal started it all, and soon we’re going to end it,” he says. For many, the closure of Britain’s last coal plant cannot come soon enough. Coal power is considered an environmental disaster, threatening the globe with climate catastrophe. Experts believe the world needs to close coal power plants at almost five times the present rate, and to stop building new ones, to meet Paris climate agreement goals. Britain has sought to lead the way internationally: in 2016 ministers set out a plan to ban coal power from the UK by 2025. And they brought the deadline forward by a year in 2021 as the government prepared to host the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow. “The time is right, realistically,” Bates says. “We need to do our bit for the planet and this place is well past its sell-by date. It was built to run for 25-30 years. And 57 years later, we’re still here.” Coal-fired power plants generated four-fifths of the UK’s power for decades until the North Sea boom saw a dash for gas-fired plants through the 1990s. Over the past decade, coal power has been relegated to the margins of Britain’s power system by costly carbon taxes and the rise of cheap renewables. Some plants, such as Drax in North Yorkshire, adapted to replace coal with wood pellets. But most were forced to close, calling time on an industry created in 1882, when the Edison Electric Light Station in Holborn, London, became the world’s first plant to generate electricity for public use. “For a time, coal plants like Ratcliffe made up the backbone of the energy system,” says Peter O’Grady, Ratcliffe’s site manager. “Latterly, I guess, we have been the scaffolding that the energy system has leaned on to enable renewables to play a bigger part.” Coal was responsible for just 1% of the power generated in the UK last year, and was called on to increase its output only as a last resort (contributing 3.4% during this winter’s cold spell). “Whether coal has provided 80% of Britain’s power or nearly zero, we’ve been here to help keep the lights on,” O’Grady says. ‘They don’t make them like this any more’ On a cool spring day, Ratcliffe’s turbine hall continues to hum. Sean Atton strides along its steel grids, passing a turbine that spins at 3,000 times a minute. He returned to work at the site last year, after a stint at another of Britain’s big power plants, to lead a skeleton team of engineers tasked with decommissioning the plant over a period of about two years. “They don’t make them like this any more,” he says, from the top of the plant’s 60-metre boiler house. To the west, Ratcliffe’s eight giant concrete cooling towers crowd the skyline. It has been estimated that at Britain’s coal-generating peak, there were as many as 250 cooling towers up and down the country. Today, only 50 remain, with between five and 10 demolished each year. By the end of this decade, Ratcliffe’s towers will be gone too. East of the boiler house, Ratcliffe’s near-empty coal yard stands as a reminder, if one were needed, that the site’s operational life is running low, too. The yard has taken more than 140,000 deliveries of coal since the late 1960s – originally from the collieries that mined Britain’s rich seams of coal. At its peak in the early 1980s, Ratcliffe would burn as much as 6.5m tonnes of coal in a single year. Over the past winter it needed less than 960,000 tonnes of coal, and that was imported from South Africa and Australia. For Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the closing of Ratcliffe marks the end of an industrial decline which has its roots four decades ago in the miners’ strikes of 1984-85. At the time, Ratcliffe was close to the centre of the bitter internal battle that brought the NUM to its knees. Some Nottinghamshire miners opposed the union bosses and the way strikes were called, and this led to the formation of the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers in 1985, as Margaret Thatcher’s government brought the industry to heel. “It was a very strange time,” recalls Richard Montgomery, who has worked as a mechanical engineer at Ratcliffe for the past 43 years. “We had all been brought up in an era of unions, so we felt this loyalty to the union but we also felt strongly that we needed to keep the lights on. It was very difficult to cross the picket lines as a young man back then.” In the intervening 40 years, the pits have closed and communities have been left to founder. The NUM’s membership has tumbled from 170,000 in 1981 to just 82 today, echoing the collapse in mining and power station jobs. British mining had been in decline for many years before Thatcher’s decision to shutter its older collieries. But the economic scars of the abrupt closures reverberate in today’s climate agenda through the calls for a “just transition” to protect communities built on fossil fuels. Kitchen fears that while Britain may be greener, it has lost something important in the process. “Since the miner’s strike, Britain has talked about opening up to do business with the world,” he says. “But we’ve been opened up to being exploited by the world. That’s what capitalism does. “We have lost jobs to other countries, as well as our energy security and the ability to control our own costs. The coal industry never made great profits, you know. It was about the national good. I’m not a dinosaur who wants to exist in the dark ages. We do need to address climate change. But let’s do it without the blinkers on.” ‘To me, it’s home’ For Ratcliffe’s remaining staff, the abiding memory of the site will be of a community forged by a sense of duty instilled under the days of state ownership. “We have been bound by a common purpose – keeping the lights on,” says Montgomery. “We do feel that responsibility, and it has kept us together through it all. If it’s 3am and we’re struggling to keep the lights on, we’ll all be there in our overalls. It’s ingrained into you: you keep the lights on at whatever cost.” Bates recalls how during the “beast from the east” storm, which plunged Britain into Arctic temperatures for about a week in 2018, workers would set off for the site in the early hours of the morning to be sure they made it in for their shifts. “What makes a person do that when it would be the easiest thing in the world to say, ‘I can’t be there. It’s snowing’? I think it’s instilled as part of this sense of service that isn’t usual in today’s society.” About half Ratcliffe’s current workforce will remain on the site until 2025 to decommission it before the demolition begins. It will be a complicated process: the plant is tucked into a triangle formed by the main railway line to London and the A453 linking Nottingham to the M1. It’s an inconvenient location for a controlled implosion of eight giant concrete towers. In the coming months, Ratcliffe is expected to set out plans for its green legacy. Its owner, the German energy giant Uniper, has already set out plans to produce green hydrogen at the site by the turn of the decade. According to Ruth Edwards, the Conservative MP for nearby Rushcliffe, it is a transformation that will bring jobs and investment to the whole east Midlands region. “The closure of Ratcliffe-on-Soar, the last coal-fired power station in the UK, is a big moment. Its closure is a time to recognise the huge contribution the power station has made and to celebrate the progress the UK has made in decarbonising its energy supply,” she says. “The future of the site as a green energy hub is incredibly exciting.” But many who have grown up with the towers as a fixture on the Nottinghamshire skyline have more mixed feelings. “I’m gutted, to be honest,” says Claire Taylor, manager at the Victoria pub in Beeston, a few miles from the Ratcliffe site. “I’m going to miss those towers when they’re gone. So many of us will. To me, they look like home.”",

        "title": "Medical device companies pay millions to NHS while pushing products, says study",
        "content": "Medical device companies are paying millions of pounds to hospitals in the UK to fund staff places, as well as training and awareness campaigns, while pushing sales of their products, including implants, heart valves and diagnostic equipment, a new report reveals. An analysis of disclosures by medical device companies found that between 2017 and 2019 they reported €425m (£367m at today’s rates) in payments to healthcare organisations in Europe, according to the study in the journal Health Policy and Technology. The businesses reported paying more than €37m to hospitals and other healthcare bodies in the UK over the three-year period. The disclosures include payments to some of the biggest hospital trusts in England. James Larkin, one of the authors of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, said the filings did not include consultancy fees for medical staff and many companies did not register their payments. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “There is a huge number of payments that are not being disclosed. The descriptions for payments which are disclosed are very vague and it is not completely clear what they are for.” There are concerns that payments from pharmaceutical and medical companies to health organisations can influence clinical decisions to use certain drugs and products. The Observer revealed last year that payments to UK health organisations and professionals reached a record £200m in 2022. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) has published a database called Disclosure UK since 2016 under which drugs companies disclose payments to healthcare organisations and individuals. It does not include payments by medical device companies. The new report analysed the disclosure database recording payments made by members of MedTech Europe, the European trade association representing the medical technology industries, from diagnosis to cure. The disclosures, logged on the transparentmedtech.eu database, cover educational grants, fellowships and public awareness campaigns. The pharmaceutical multinational Johnson &amp; Johnson disclosed the highest value of payments, with €184m to 27 countries. US company Abbott Laboratories paid €44m. The report stated: “These payments provide medical device companies with an opportunity to influence a range of [organisations] such as hospitals, universities, and professional training bodies, all of which significantly influence healthcare practice.” It said the potential conflicts of interest highlighted the need for a publicly mandated disclosure database. In the UK, Johnson &amp; Johnson, which manufactures products including hip implants and surgical robotics, has made “educational” payments to several hospital trusts, including Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust, Barts Health NHS trust and South Tees hospitals NHS foundation trust. The US company Edwards Lifesciences, which makes heart valves, has made payments to at least five NHS hospital trusts. They include a 2022 grant of £67,650 to fund a “nurse educator” at King’s College hospital NHS foundation trust to support the delivery of a valve implantation programme. A review published by Julia Cumberlege in July 2020, entitled First Do No Harm, which examined how the health system in England responds to reports from patients about side effects from treatments, flagged up concerns over payments from manufacturers to doctors and healthcare organisations. Lady Cumberlege’s report said there were public concerns that such payments could influence medical practice and proposed a mandatory register. The government had a consultation last year on the possible introduction of regulations mandating the disclosure of industry payments to the healthcare sector. Jonathan Evans, director of communications at the Association of British HealthTech Industries (ABHI), the UK’s leading industry body for health technology, said the relationship between medical device companies and healthcare professionals was crucial to the advancement of safety and patient outcomes. He said: “This is necessary to support training, education and product development that can advance the best possible patient care.” Evans added that under the ABHI code of practice, all transactions between a company and a healthcare professional were reported to the NHS employer. Johnson &amp; Johnson said it was committed to transparency and supported the mandatory disclosure of educational grants. Abbott Laboratories and Edwards Lifesciences have been contacted for comment. Hospital trusts said they had strict policies to manage conflict of interests and income received from working with medical device firms. Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust said: “We are one of the largest, most research active trusts in the country and work with medical device companies to develop better treatments that improve the quality of care for our patients.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Transparency is vital to the healthcare system and doctors are already required to declare their conflicts of interest. Last autumn we consulted on proposals around the disclosure of industry payments to the healthcare sector. We are considering the responses to the consultation and a response will be published in due course.”",

        "title": "A heedless dash for net zero will waste cash and, later, votes | Phillip Inman",
        "content": "In the energetic pursuit of net zero, billions of pounds could be squandered needlessly. That’s the lesson from countries as diverse as Italy, the US and UK, where the rush to subsidise green projects suggests vast sums are at risk. Worse, they could be lining the pockets of multinational businesses and City financiers. In the UK, 14 years of austerity has left the public sector struggling to make coherent, strategic decisions. When a decision is finally made, it is a panic measure that quickly unravels. The fallout could be that voters become disenchanted with green tech, especially if the dash for net zero leads to higher taxes and higher borrowing while early adopters unwittingly pay for costly mistakes. Some economists argue the UK can double its investment plans to reach net zero. Even should the financial markets agree and the UK avoids a Truss-like panic, this proposal doesn’t look at whether the public sector’s can carry through changes at breakneck speed without making costly mistakes. In the run-up to the election, some on the left and in green groups will defend any waste and fraud as collateral damage. On the right, the waste and fraud will be used as an excuse to abandon all moves to net zero. Neither approach is right. The focus needs to be on the boring, nitty-gritty issues of coordination and planning. Hundreds of UK councils have set 2030 as a target for more than halving emissions or even going completely net zero, mostly without the powers to achieve it. As is common across the private sector, they rely on consultants to advise on ways to achieve the target as the time left to decarbonise runs short. Labour was in a rush before Keir Starmer U-turned on his headline green pledges and scaled back the party’s investment programme, including a plan to insulate 19m homes to a more manageable 5m. Would extra money have allowed Labour to achieve that original target? The Tories had money in place, but when the Green Homes Grant was cancelled, homeowners arguably had a lucky escape from a half-baked scheme. Contractors were expected to provide an army of inspectors within a few months of the scheme getting the green light. Even now, councils are struggling to train inspectors, and the construction industry is rife with rumours of building firms putting pressure on them “to certify beyond their level of competence”. If Labour wants to revive this programme or start something similar, it needs a strategy that allows time for proper training. Anything else risks a backlash that could make Starmer a one-term prime minister. Many EU countries are handling things just as badly, it appears. Italy’s Superbonus 110% – a scheme similar to the UK’s Green Homes Grant – has subsidised the same sectors as the EU’s €750bn Covid recovery fund directly supported. According to the Italian government, the total amount committed to house renovations under various schemes since 2020 reached a colossal €219bn by the end of February 2024 – equivalent to 10.5% of Italy’s gross domestic product in 2023. Lorenzo Codogno, a former chief economist at Rome’s finance ministry who has since founded consulting business LC Macro Advisors, says Italy’s GDP growth has improved, but falls well short of what would be suggested by this massive spending spree. He says construction costs spiralled as building firms, unable to meet demand, jacked up prices, sometimes fraudulently, while green funds overlapped with existing schemes and crowded out other types of activity. In the US, Joe Biden’s green subsidies are coming under similar scrutiny, with fears of potential waste and fraud. The watchdog that oversees the US Environmental Protection Agency warned last year that boosting the EPA’s budget by about $100bn through new legislation would see some of it frittered on hastily-put-together projects or siphoned off illegally. The need for speed is understandable when the climate emergency is flashing red. And it is clear that (rich) countries which cause most emissions need to ramp up their efforts to cut carbon. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has shown with economic modelling that the Inflation Reduction Act, which devotes $369bn in subsidies through grants, loans and tax credits to public and private entities, has benefits that “far exceed the costs”. Yet those who maintain that projects should be ready in months, that new skills can be acquired within weeks and that decisions need only a few days’ consideration risk inevitable voter resistance when the tales of money being squandered emerge, as they will.",

        "title": "Even a ‘rate shock’ for British mortgage borrowers may not help the banks",
        "content": "Mortgage borrowers who had been holding out for more affordable rates had their hopes dashed last week, as disappointing economic data raised the likelihood of borrowing costs staying higher for longer. A drop in the annual rate of inflation to 3.2% in March fell only just short of City expectations for a drop to 3.1%, but that was enough to prompt investors to trim their bets on an imminent cut to interest rates. Financial markets, which had until recently been pricing in a first interest rate cut by the Bank of England in June, are now forecasting that the first reduction may not come until September or November. That could prove too late for many of the 1.6 million mortgage borrowers who, according to the industry association UK Finance, are due to roll off cheaper fixed-rate mortgages and on to higher rates this year. “They will face a rate shock,” said Charles Roe, UK Finance’s director of mortgages. Households whose monthly payments were priced against sub-1% interest rates just a few years ago will be facing higher payments linked to the current 5.25% base rate. And that will leave many borrowers with a choice: fix now, or take a gamble on a floating rate in hopes of the Bank of England taking action by the end of the year. On the bright side, Roe says, most reversion rates – on to which borrowers will move if they decide against signing on to a new fixed term – are much lower than the near-10% rates being set for some new mortgages this year. Furthermore, lenders will have made sure borrowers could afford higher repayments. But the bad news is that even if policymakers cut rates this year, this is unlikely to make a significant dent in near-term borrowing costs. Chris Sykes, technical director at mortgage broker Private Finance, said most lenders were already pricing in, and passing on, the drop in base rates expected over the next two to five years. “It may reduce rates slightly after the first drop, as the prospect of a drop becomes a reality, but doesn’t mean it will be large,” Sykes said. “Hopefully, in 18 months’ to two years’ time, we are in a slightly lower-rate environment. But predictions are lots of mortgages will still be in the 4% [range] as ‘the new normal’.” Higher interest rates have tended to be good news for lenders, which are able to charge more for loans and mortgages, and so increase their revenues. But the benefits of that trend have started to wane. “The combination of competition, an apparent end to interest rate increases from the Bank of England, and political and public pressure, may mean the peak is already behind us for ‘net interest’ margins,” said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. “That will take a toll on profit,” Hewson said, setting the scene for a relatively disappointing set of first-quarter results due this week from the UK’s four largest banks. The country’s largest mortgage lender, Lloyds, will kick off earnings week on Wednesday, and is expected to reveal a 26% drop in pre-tax profits to £1.7bn for the three months to March. That reflects analysts’ expectations for a drop in net interest income, as well as a 15% rise in impairment charges to protect itself against a possible rise in defaults. Investors will also want updates on the Financial Conduct Authority’s investigation into whether consumers have been charged inflated prices for car loans. Lloyds, which has the largest car loan division of the four, has already put aside £450m – far short of the £2bn that analysts believe it could be on the hook for. Barclays will follow on Thursday with a forecast 15% drop in pre-tax profits to £2.2bn, despite what could be a strong performance from its investment bank. “Investors will be hoping Barclays follows suit from its US peers, who have, by and large, reported improved performance from their investment banking divisions,” said Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Goldman Sachs reported a 28% rise in first-quarter profits earlier this month. NatWest, meanwhile, is expected to report a 30% drop in pre-tax profits on Friday, to £1.3bn. That could ultimately dampen returns for the government, as it plans to sell a portion of its 28.9% stake in the bank to retail investors this summer. HSBC will round off earnings week on 30 April. While average analyst forecasts have yet to be released, investors are already steeled for a $1bn (£800m) hit to pre-tax earnings linked to the sale of HSBC’s business in Argentina, where it has been knocked by hyperinflation and volatile currency moves in recent years. “Investors will be hoping there are no more surprise writedowns on the cards,” Britzman said.",

        "content": "Iceland has dropped the outdated “That’s why mums go to Iceland” slogan to reflect the fact that other people also do grocery shopping. The frozen foods retailer has tweaked its strapline to the more neutral “That’s why we go to Iceland” in an advertising push with the TV personality Josie Gibson as its new ambassador. “I think the new tagline is great because Iceland is not just for mums. Even though mums love it, Iceland is for everybody,” said the presenter, who won Big Brother in 2010. Iceland first used the mums line in 1970, with the slogan “Mums love it”, before moving on to “Mum’s gone to Iceland” in the late 1980s. In 2004, with pop star Kerry Katona fronting its ad campaigns, the strapline was updated to the now classic “That’s why mums go to Iceland”. Iceland’s executive chair, Richard Walker, said: “Iceland’s always been number one with mums and our new campaign celebrates our growing customer base, from across all aspects of the great British public.” Walker said Gibson, who is a mother herself, was “the perfect person to encapsulate the friendly welcome” customers receive at Iceland. It is not the first time the retailer has moved away from the “mum” angle in its strapline. For Peter Andre’s Iceland ads in 2014, the slogan was retooled to: “That’s why Peter goes to Iceland”. The latest celebrity ambassador represents a change in tactics after Walker’s announcement last year that amid growing losses, it had dropped its Christmas ad in order to invest in “supporting customers during the cost of living crisis”. The company has expanded its range of £1 value meals. The retailer has recently aimed to broaden its appeal to UK shoppers beyond the frozen foods aisles, launching its own household goods range among a variety of new own-label products. Iceland has also recently become the first supermarket to create a panel to represent its customers in the run-up to the general election. The panel of seven UK customers will write a manifesto, to be shared with political parties, after a survey of up to 6,000 regular customers about their concerns. The latest ad campaign will run over 12 months, during primetime TV slots starting from Saturday, including Gogglebox, In for a Penny, Britain’s Got Talent and Made in Chelsea.",

        "title": "Unilever to scale back environmental and social pledges",
        "content": "Unilever is to scale back its environmental and social aims, provoking critics to say its board should “hang their heads in shame”. The consumer goods company behind brands ranging from Dove beauty products to Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice-cream was seen as perhaps the foremost proponent of corporate ethics – particularly under the tenure of its Dutch former boss Paul Polman. On Friday, the London-based firm’s current chief executive appeared to signal a strategic U-turn for the company, which is valued at £94bn on the London Stock Exchange. In an interview with Bloomberg, Hein Schumacher confirmed plans to water down the company’s ethical pledges on a range of issues including plastic usage and pay. The shift comes amid a wider trend of pressure from shareholders in corporations ranging from banks to oil companies to cut costs and focus more on stock market performance than green projects. Unilever, one of the largest users of plastic packaging in the world, had previously promised to halve its use of virgin plastics by 2025. Instead, it will now aim for a reduction of a third by 2026, Bloomberg reported. The less ambitious target equates to about 100,000 tonnes more fresh plastic every year. The company is also abandoning a pledge to pay direct suppliers a living wage by 2030, instead proposing fair pay for suppliers accounting for half its annual spend on goods and services by 2026. It is also dropping a promise to spend €2bn (£1.7bn) a year with diverse businesses by 2025 and a commitment that 5% of its workforce will be made up of people with disabilities by the same year. Schumacher said people’s focus on environmental and social issues was “cyclical”. “When you have a huge drought for a number of months but everything else is going fine, the attention is on climate. These days it’s about wars and rightly so, that’s at the forefront. “I’m not going to shout that we’re saving the world, but I want to make sure that in everything that we do, that it is indeed better,” he added. He insisted that the company could still “make a difference” in the four key areas of climate, plastics, nature and people’s livelihoods. Nina Schrank, the head of plastics at Greenpeace UK, said Unilever bosses “should hang their heads in shame”. “Hein Schumacher and his board are well aware of the ruinous impact of their plastic pollution,” she said. “The tsunami of plastic they produce each year meant their existing targets were already not fit for purpose. We needed much more. And so rather than doubling down, they’re quietly dressing up their backpedalling and low ambition as worthy pragmatism.” Unilever’s dilution of its ethical stance follows a period of worsening performance in which the company’s shares have fallen by 8% since Schumacher took over in July 2023. Under Polman – and his successor Alan Jope – Unilever became increasingly involved in ethical initiatives. It promised to invest €1bn over 10 years in green projects and provided funding from its cleaning brand Domestos for a Unicef project to improve access to toilets in India. The firm last month released plans to cut 7,500 jobs globally and spin off its ice-cream division as part of an overhaul aimed at saving about €800m over the next three years.",

        "title": "Jeremy Hunt’s tax cut plans to face IMF scrutiny next month",
        "content": "Jeremy Hunt’s plans for a fresh tranche of pre-election tax cuts will be put under the microscope when the International Monetary Fund conducts its in-depth look at the UK economy next month. IMF officials said the team sent to London to conduct its annual health check would be looking closely at whether tax increases or spending cuts would be needed after the general election. Asked whether tax cuts before the vote would be followed by tax increases or spending cuts in the next parliament, the fund said this would feature in its article 4 consultations with the UK. It issued a general warning earlier this week against pre-election tax cuts that might damage the public finances. The Treasury is already drawing up plans for an autumn statement before polling day and there has been speculation the chancellor will use the opportunity to cut taxes for a third time in less than a year. Hunt reduced national insurance contributions by two percentage points in both last November’s autumn statement and the March budget. Helge Berger, the deputy head of the IMF’s European division, said the Washington-based organisation was following events in the UK “closely” and that the UK government’s fiscal policy would feature strongly in the article 4 study. “I wouldn’t speculate about the shape of tax cuts in the future”, Berger said. “The broader point is that there is an effort under way to provide fiscal consolidation, which is appropriate. “There are significant pressures on the budget coming from the spending side, including health and infrastructure.” Berger said the government should look at ways that would allow it to respond to these pressures. “It needs to look for revenue measures and spending measures going forward,” he said. The IMF will also be studying recent developments in the UK labour market – including the reasons for rising inactivity – in the article 4 review. After Rishi Sunak’s announcement of a clampdown on “sicknote Britain”, Berger said the IMF recognised how important labour supply had been to the UK economy. “In the last two years most of the momentum has come from an expanding population, including from migration. So the increase in inactivity is a concern for growth.” Berger said there would be weaker productivity if people were ill and had to work. “One area to think about is the quality of health care. Another is the way disability is supported,” he said. Official figures released this week showed the number of people inactive because of illness or disability has risen to a record 2.83 million. The UK is the only member of the G7 group of leading developed nations where the share of working-age people outside the workforce remains higher than before the pandemic.",

        "title": " UK airline emissions on track to reach record high in 2024",
        "content": "Emissions from UK flights are rapidly returning to pre-pandemic levels, with CO2 pollution from aviation on track to reach a record high this year. The increase means the sector may breach a key plank of the government’s Jet Zero strategy, which pledged to not surpass 2019 figures on the way to reaching net zero emissions from aviation by 2050. Several airlines are already emitting more than ever before, according to analysis from the campaign group Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E) based on UK and EU carbon reporting and other flight data. It estimates that Ryanair emitted 13.5% more CO2 in 2023 than it did in 2019, with easyJet up by 4.8% and Jet2.com up by 26.3%. British Airways was still by far the UK’s most polluting airline, although its emissions remain 18% below 2019 levels. Last year, 940,000 flights departed from UK airports, emitting a total of 32 mn tonnes of CO2, 89% of 2019 levels, according to T&amp;E. It said there had been remarkable levels of growth in comparison to 2022 alone, with long-haul flight emissions 28% higher, and that the data suggested aviation emissions could reach a record high in 2024. BA, Ryanair and easyJet have announced continued planned expansion of between 7% and 9% for 2024. Although the newer planes with lower fuel consumption ordered by airlines such as Ryanair mean they have boasted of lower emissions for each passenger, the rapid growth in traffic means their overall pollution figures are growing inexorably. As well as warning that the UK government’s Jet Zero roadmap towards more sustainable aviation risks going off course well before 2050, T&amp;E urged policymakers to reconsider how airlines are taxed given the limitations of the emissions trading scheme (ETS). The UK’s ETS only covers flights wholly within the UK, the European Economic Area and Switzerland. That means that long-haul flights in and out of the UK – accounting for the majority of emissions – escape without charge while domestic or European flights pay for each tonne of CO2. British Airways, whose emissions grew an estimated 25% in 2023, pays less under the ETS than easyJet or Ryanair, despite producing almost three times as much CO2 because of its long-haul network. Virgin Atlantic, which only flies to destinations outside Europe, paid nothing at all in ETS. Wizz Air paid £34.23 for each tonne of CO2 emitted, according to T&amp;E. BA would have paid another £350m annually under an ETS system that included long-haul flights, T&amp;E added. Ryanair itself has called for an overhaul of the system, demanding the extension of the UK and EU ETS to all flights. However, reform of the scheme to include long-haul flights has proved difficult in the past, with the US and China threatening to derail previous EU attempts to find a fairer global solution. Future additional emissions from all flights will be liable for offsets under the Corsia system agreed by the UN body, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), before the pandemic – but it is not mandatory worldwide until 2027 and campaigners fear the impact will be negligible due to the likely cost to airlines. T&amp;E has called for a kerosene tax. Matt Finch, the UK policy manager at T&amp;E, said: “Some airlines had their most polluting year ever in 2023, and there is a good chance that many more will get that badge of dishonour in 2024. “The UK government is apparently committed to charging polluters to help pay the clean-up costs they cause, but it is wilfully ignoring charging airlines, despite their growing climate impact. That’s the directly opposite approach they’re taking to the nation’s drivers at the petrol pump.” The Department for Transport was approached for comment. A BA spokesperson said: “As this report recognises, [our] emission levels are below where they were in 2019. We are proud of the 10% reduction in our carbon intensity we’ve delivered since 2019 and are working hard towards our target of net zero by 2050.”",

        "title": "Pound drops as Bank of England deputy governor sees lower inflation ahead – as it happened",
        "content": "A late PS: The pound has dropped below $1.24 for the first time since last November. Sterling is down almost half a cent tonight at $1.2391, after BoE deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden said he thought inflation could be lower over the next few years than the Bank had previously forecast. Time to wrap up; here’s today’s main stories so far: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/19/finnish-startup-food-air-solar-power-solein Oil is ending the day flat, another sign that investors are more relaxed about Middle East events. This leaves Brent crude unchanged at $87.10 per barrel. I mentioned this morning that European stock markets weren’t really plunging on the back of Israel’s attack on Iran. And to underline that, stocks in London have just closed higher. The FTSE 100 index has ended the day 18 points higher at 7895, up 0.25%. Packaging company Mondi led the risers, up 9%, after abandoning its hopes of taking over DS Smith. The picture across Europe is mixed, though, with Germany’s DAX down around 0.5% today, Spain’s IBEX off 0.3%, and France’s CAC flat. Sir Dave Ramsden concluded his speech in Washington (online here) by saying he would take a “watchful and responsive” approach to setting interest rates: He says: The MPC will have to consider collectively the degree of restrictiveness of policy at each upcoming meeting to ensure inflation returns sustainably to the 2% target. I will continue to take a watchful and responsive approach to my policy decisions as I have tried to do throughout this period of unprecedented structural shocks. Watchful, in terms of assessing the evidence as it accumulates and responsive in terms of the stance of monetary policy warranted by the evidence. Some Bank critics have said it is being too slow to respond to the economic slowdown by leaving interest rates on hold since last summer, having been too slow to raise them as inflation began to rise in 2021. In his speech, Sir Dave Ramsden shows how recent falls in headline inflation have dampened inflation expectations. That leads to a drop in pay growth, which leads to a slowdown in services inflation (as firms have smaller wage increases to pass on), he explains. A Bank of England deputy governor has predicted that UK inflation will fall back close to the official target in April, for the first time since the summer of 2021. Sir Dave Ramsden has told an event in the US that he is confident that price pressures will ease further, after CPI inflation fell to 3.2% earlier this week. And significantly, he also suggested he was less confident that inflation would rise towards the end of this year, as the Bank has previously predicted. Speaking at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, in Washington DC, Ramsden argues that the UK looks like less of an outlier in terms of recent inflation performance and more of a laggard. March’s fall in the CPI index means inflation is falling more slowly in the UK than in the US, and Ramsden predicts that April’s data – due in mid-May – will show a fall close to eurozone levels (where inflation was just 2.4% in March). Ramsden cautions that the risks from events in the Middle East “remain to the upside”, but predicts that the cut to the UK’s energy price cap this month will help push inflation down. He says: Given we know the level of the Ofgem price cap for April and also taking account of the freezing of fuel duties in the March Budget, then other things equal we can be confident headline CPI inflation will fall sharply in April, to close to the 2% target. Ramsden was one of eight policymakers who voted to leave interest rates on hold in March, with one voting for a cut. The MPC will meet again in early May, and Ramsden says today that he believes there’s more chance that inflation stays near the 2% target over the next three years – rather than back towards 3% by the end of this year, as the Bank had predicted. Ramsden says: Over the last few months I have become more confident in the evidence that risks to persistence in domestic inflation pressures are receding, helped by improved inflation dynamics. As we set out in our March 2024 minutes there is a range of views among the MPC on these risks. For me the balance of domestic risks to the outlook for UK inflation, relative to the February MPR forecasts, is now tilted to the downside, with a scenario where inflation stays close to the 2% target over the whole forecast period at least as likely. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool is concerned by the rather relaxed response of financial markets to the Iran-Israel conflict. He tells us: It looks like financial markets are buying into the argument that either Iran or Israel can ...“put into a computer program” their military operations and that these operations will run “smoothly”. Both Iran and Israel are playing with fire. Past experience, as I note in a recent LSE Business blog, shows that oil prices and inflation do increase in response to rising geopolitical risk and, at the same time, UK growth will take a “hit”. I am rather sceptical that “this time is different”. A senior lawyer for the Post Office fought a high court case brought by post office operators “tooth and claw” because the state-owned body knew criminal appeals would follow if it lost the lawsuit, a public inquiry heard today. Rodric Williams, a senior lawyer with the Post Office, was giving evidence for the second day to a public inquiry which is looking into how hundreds of post office operators were pursued and prosecuted for more than a decade over alleged financial shortfalls in their branch accounts, which it has since emerged were caused by bugs in the Post Office’s Horizon IT system. Williams who is the head of legal (dispute resolution and brand) at the Post Office was asked about the aggressive litigation strategy which Post Office took in fighting a high court lawsuit brought by post office operators including Alan Bates, whose fight for justice was dramatised by ITV earlier this year. The high court case paved the way for the convicted victims to be exonerated. Edward Henry KC, a barrister acting for post office victims, put to Williams that Post Office had fought the high court lawsuit “tooth and claw” because they knew if they lost the case “ a cascade of criminal appeals would follow.” Williams replied: “I don’t recall turning my mind to that at the time.” Henry also accused Williams of being in possession of all the information that was eventually deployed to overturn the conviction of post office operator Seema Misra, one of the best known victims of the scandal. In 2010 Misra was sentenced to 15 months in prison for theft and locked up on her son’s 10th birthday while eight weeks pregnant. She was placed on suicide watch after collapsing in court. Her conviction was amongst those overturned by the court of appeal in 2021. The inquiry heard that Williams knew by 2013 and certainly by 2016 that expert evidence used in her trial was flawed and her criminal conviction was unsafe. Henry said: “Mrs Misra’s conviction was eventually quashed in April 2021, ten and half years after she’d been wrongly convicted. You personally were aware of information sufficient to quash her conviction by July 2013 weren’t you?” Williams replied: “I had information - whether it was sufficient to quash.. That I do not know.” The inquiry continues. The US stock markeet hs opened flattish, as anxiety over the Middle East eases. The S&amp;P 500 share index has dipped just 2 points, or 0.05%, to 5,008, while the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 0.2%. The tech-focused Nasdaq has lost 0.3%, as shares in streaming service Netflix slide 7% after it issued a mixed trading outlook last night. Interesting developments in the UK supermarket scene today. Bloomberg are reporting that US private equity firm TDR Capital is closing in on a deal to buy billionaire Zuber Issa’s 22.5% stake in Asda. The deal, if completed, would increase TDR’s stake in Asda and tighten its grip on the indebted supermarket chain. Bloomberg reports: The agreement for Issa’s 22.5% stake would give TDR majority control and could be announced in coming weeks, the people said, asking not to be named with negotiations in flux. They declined to specify the terms being discussed. TDR’s holding in Asda would rise to about two-thirds, while the transaction would further the dismantling of the relationship between brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa. Zuber Issa, his brother Mohsin, and TDR bough a majority stake in Asda in 2021. The Blackburn-based Issa brothers had previously become billionaires by building up a petrol station empire. It emerged in February that Zuber was looking to sell his stake, after the breakdown of Mohsin’s marriage was said to have “sent shockwaves” through the family. Rising real wages could help the UK retail sector recover in 2024, argues Barbara Teixeira Araujo, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. Following this morning’s weaker-than-expected retail sales report, Teixeira Araujo says: “While U.K. retail sales were flat in March, it is not all doom and gloom. Sales rose in the first quarter at the strongest pace since the post-pandemic rebound in mid-2021, and will contribute around 0.1 percentage points to first-quarter GDP growth. Our view is that the retail sector bottomed out in the second half of 2023, and we expect rising real wages to support sales in the high street this year. April’s cut to National Insurance contributions, combined with the increases in the state pension, welfare benefits and with the rise in the National Living Wage will further support take-home pay, making 2024 the year when retailer’s fortunes will likely turn.” Global stock markets are inching higher after hitting a two-month low earlier today. The MSCI All Country index dropped to its lowest since February as reports of an attack on Iran came in, but has since recovered a little as Tehran played down the incident. Amazon could be forced to recognise a trade union for the first time in the UK after members of the GMB at the internet retailer’s Coventry warehouse were granted permission to hold a legally binding ballot. The Central Arbitration Committee (CAC), the independent statutory body that adjudicates on collective bargaining rights, has ruled that a vote should be held at the site to test support for union recognition. A win would give the GMB the right to discuss terms and conditions such as pay, hours and holidays with Amazon. Elsewhere in the City, the battle to own packaging firm DS Smith seems to have wrapped up. British paper and packaging group Mondi has announced it has decided it will not make an offer to buy rival DS Smith. Mondi folded after DS Smith agreed to be taken over by International Paper of the US in a £5.8bn all-share deal, earlier this week. Back in March, Mondi had pounced on DS Smith and agreed an all-share deal worth £5.14bn; that agreement, though, has been gatecrashed by International Paper. Mondi says today: Following a period of due diligence, and after carefully considering the value the combination with DS Smith would deliver to Mondi’s shareholders, the Mondi Board has decided that the transaction would not be in the best interests of its shareholders. Accordingly, Mondi does not intend to make an offer for DS Smith. Shares in DS Smith have tumbled by 10%, as traders abandon hopes of a bidding war. Mondi’s shares have jumped 9%. Oil has now lost all its earlier gains, as Iran indicates it is not planning an immediate response against Israel. A senior Iranian official has told Reuters that Iran has no plan for immediate retaliation against Israel, explaining: “The foreign source of the incident has not been confirmed. We have not received any external attack, and the discussion leans more towards infiltration than attack.” Brent crude has now sunk back to $86.57 per barrel, around 0.5% lower than its closing price yesterday, as traders try to assess how these latest developments will impact the Middle East political landscape. “The situation remains fluid”, explains Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management: Iranian state-controlled media appears to be downplaying the attacks, offering reassurances that nuclear facilities remain unaffected., making it potentially challenging for Iran’s government to justify any retaliation if the narrative in Isfahan continues to be reported as a tempest in a teapot. Airline stocks are off their earlier lows, too, but still down for the current session…. After approaching a record high early ths morning, gold has now slipped back as Tehran plays down today’s attack. Bullion is just 0.1% higher at $2,381 per ounce, having traded as high at $2,417/ounce at one stage. In the building sector, construction group Geoffrey Osborne is calling in the administrators. A notice announcing the company’s intention to appoint adminstrators was filed with the High Court shortly before 4pm yesterday, Construction News reports. This follows “an extensive effort” to secure new investment, Geoffrey Osborne explains, following difficult years in which the construction sector was hit by the pandemic, rising costs, and the surge in mortgage rates. The company says: Osborne has faced significant headwinds common to the entire construction [industry] over the past two years, fuelled by high inflation, the lingering impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit, and a slowdown in public sector procurement. Despite these challenges, Osborne has maintained strong relationships with suppliers, contractors and staff, while delivering for customers. UK mortgage rates have crept a little higher, after we learned on Wednesday that inflation fell by less than expected last month. The financial markets are now pricing in slightly less than two interest rate cuts this year, meaning investors aren’t fully convinced that the Bank of England will have cut Bank rate to 4.75% by December from 5.25% today. Data firm Moneyfacts reports that average mortgages rates are a little higher this morning: The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.83%. This is up from an average rate of 5.81% on the previous working day. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.40%. This is up from an average rate of 5.39% on the previous working day. Britain’s FTSE 100 index is also being pushed lower by retail stocks. JD Sports (-2.3%) and Marks &amp; Spencer (-2.1%) are in the top Footsie fallers, amid disappointment that sales volumes were lower than expected in March. UK retailers’ failure to grow sales volumes last month (see earlier post) shows price rises are deterring consumption, says Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management: UK March retail sales were weaker than consensus expectations. Consumers still seem intent on punishing attempts at profit-led inflation— price increases are deterring consumption. UK retail sales data does not directly capture the pivot to spending on having fun as services are not included, but stronger clothing sales hint at this trend. Falling airline shares are dragging European stock markets to their lowest level in a month this morning. The main airlines are mainly lower this morning, hit by the higher oil price (which pushes up fuel costs) and fears of travel disruption if the Middle East conflict escalates. Here’s the situation presently: IAG (owner of British Airways): -2.8% Ryanair: -1.6% EasyJet: -2.1% Wizz Air: -2.1% Deutsche Lufthansa: -0.6% Air France: -2.4% Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says geopolitics are taking centre stage in the markets again: Nearly a week to the day when Iran sent drones and missiles into Israel, Israel has retaliated and sent a missile into Iran. The initial reports caused a large uptick in the oil price. Brent crude jumped nearly $4 per barrel on the news above $90 per barrel, but it has since retreated as the details about the extent of the attack emerge. The missiles struck targets in Western Iran, and no nuclear sites have been damaged. Air space around Iran had been closed, but reports say it is now back open. Thus, we can assume this will not be a barrage of attacks and instead a one punch retaliation for Iran’s move last Saturday. As Jeremey Bowen of the BBC put it, the clandestine war between the two foes is now out in the open. So far, the attacks have been restrained, which is causing some relief to markets. However, the risk premium across asset prices is likely to rise as the future remains unclear. Will Iran and Israel leave each other alone now that they have had their tit-for-tat reprisals? Or does this continue, with well-planned ‘attacks’ that are designed to cause the least amount of civilian damage and are more a show of what could be possible? While this is obviously preferable to an all-out war, it is a risky strategy. One mistake that causes casualties or hits an unexpected target could trigger an escalation in reprisals and a deeper, more dangerous situation in the Middle East. This is why volatility is likely to stick around, especially as it comes at a delicate time for financial markets as they recalibrate expectations for interest rate cuts. Although European stock markets certainly aren’t in a full-blooded plunge, yet anyway, the main indices are all in the red – following losses across Asia overnight (see 7.21am). The European Stoxx 600 is at a one-month low, as investors fret about events in the Middle East. Here’s the situation in early trading: FTSE 100: -36 points or -0.46% at 7842 points Germany’s DAX: -152 points or -0.9% at 17,681 points France’s CAC: -45 points or -0.6% at 7,976 points Italy’s FTSE MIB: -345 points or -1% at 33,533 points Wall Street is heading for losses when it opens in four hours, too, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.5% in pre-market trading. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says: “Asian markets bore the brunt of the breaking news of a retaliatory attack on Iran by Israel, also sending Dow futures sharply lower and resulting in further spikes in gold and oil prices. US markets will not have the opportunity to react directly to the developments until later, but the escalation will put pressure on the main indices, which were already lining up for a weekly drop. The Dow Jones managed a wafer-thin gain on Thursday, whereas the Nasdaq and S&amp;P500 continued on a downward trend which is eroding the heady gains made over recent months. In the year to date, the Dow has now added just 0.2%, the Nasdaq 3.9% and the S&amp;P500 5% as interest rate concerns continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Gas prices have jumped this morning, with the UK month-ahead contract up 1.9% to 82.7p per therm. Shares are dipping in Europe as traders digest events in the Middle East overnight. In London, the FTSE 100 blue-chip share index is down 38 points or 0.5% at 7838 points. IAG, the parent company of British Airways, is the top faller, down almost 4%, followed by easyJet (-2.5%). Engineering firm Rolls-Royce, which makes and services jet engines, are down 1.7%. European markets are also lower, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 down 0.6%. Although sales volumes (the amount of stuff people bought) were flat in March, the first quarter of 2024 has been a brighter time for retailers than the last quarter of 2023. Sales volumes increased by 1.9% in the three months to March 2024 when compared with the previous three months, the ONS reports. That brings the retail recession to an end, declares Capital Economics this morning. Alex Kerr, their assistant economist, explains: Despite the softer-than-expected data, retail sales still added almost 0.1 percentage points to real GDP growth in Q1. Moreover, the prospect of interest rate cuts and the boost to real household incomes, from falling inflation and the 2p cut to national insurance in April, suggest the recovery in consumer spending will continue throughout this year. Automotive fuel sales volumes rose to their highest level since May 2022 in March, today’s retail sales report shows. Retailers told the ONS this rise was linked to increased footfall on their forecourts. March’s retail sales stagnation is “disappointing”, says Nicholas Hyett, Investment Manager at Wealth Club, commented: “Retailers had a gloomier March than many expected, and overall sales remain 1.2% below their pre-covid peak. Department stores remain an area of particular weakness, not good news for John Lewis which announced it would not be paying its regular staff bonus for the second year in a row during the month. However, high street shops more broadly have actually performed better, it’s food retail and online shopping that have held back growth. The disappointing numbers will fuel speculation that the Bank of England will consider interest rate cuts this summer, though are not poor enough to necessitate a move. Retail sales across Britain stalled in March, as the cost of living squeeze continues to hit spending, new data shows. The Office for National Statistics has just reported that British retail sales volumes stagnated in March, following modest growth of just 0.1% in February (revised up from stagnation). That’s weaker than expected; economists polled by Reuters had expected sales growth of 0.3% in March. While spending on motor fuel and non-food goods rose, there was a drop in spending at department stores, on food, and online. On an annual basis, sales volumes rose 0.8% over the year to March 2024, weaker than the 1% expected. That leaves them 1.2% below their pre-Covid-19 level in February 2020. ONS senior statistician Heather Bovill says: “Retail sales registered no growth in March. Hardware stores, furniture shops, petrol stations and clothing stores all reported a rise in sales. However, these gains were offset by falling food sales and in department stores where retailers say higher prices hit trading. “Looking at the longer-term picture, across the latest three months retail sales increased after a poor Christmas.” Last night, ratings agency S&amp;P Global lowered Israel’s credit rating, before the reports of explosions in Iran. S&amp;P cut Israel’s long-term ratings to A-plus from AA-minus, citing Heightened Geopolitical Risk, and left its outlook on negative. S&amp;P says: “We forecast that Israel’s general government deficit will widen to 8% of GDP in 2024, mostly as a result of increased defense spending” S&amp;P Global predicts that a wider regional conflict will be avoided, but that the Israel-Hamas war and the confrontation with Hezbollah appear set to continue throughout 2024. Asia-Pacific stock markets are a sea of red today, after Israel carried out military operations against Iran. Japan’s Nikkei share index has shed 2.3%, or 883 points, to 37,196, away from the record high set last month. China’s CSI 300 is off 0.8%, and South Korea’s KOSPI is down 1.9%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Reports of powerful explosions in Iran overnight have pushed up the oil price, as investors fear escalation in the Middle East crisis. Brent crude surged back over $90 amid reports of explosions near the Iranian city of Isfahan, with US officials confirming that Israel has carried out military operations against Iran. Oil jumped on fears that the conflict had entered a new phase, while stocks fell. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, says: Reports of an Israeli aerial bombardment targeting a key nuclear facility in central Isfahan have sparked a significant shift out of risk assets and into safe-haven investments. Metal and soft commodity prices – such as wheat, soybeans and corn - also rose, on fears of shipping disruption and higher energy input costs. Higher oil and food prices, and shipping costs, would add to inflation, undermining efforts to bring the cost of living crisis under control. But… markets are calming down somewhat, with Brent crude now easing back to $89/barrel (up 2% today) as Iran appears to play down the incident. A senior commander of Iran’s Army Siavosh Mihandoust has said that no damage was caused in the overnight attack, according to state TV, adding that the noise heard overnight in Isfahan was due to air defence systems targeting a “suspicious object”. Diplomat Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations, says this is important, and that the key is to break the dangerous cycle of escalation.

Some lenders to its core operating company could lose up to 40% of their money under the plans, which which is at an advanced stage.

        "title": "Eating light: Finnish startup begins making food ‘from air and solar power’",
        "content": "Nothing appears remarkable about a dish of fresh ravioli made with solein. It looks and tastes the same as normal pasta. But the origins of the proteins which give it its full-bodied flavour are extraordinary: they come from Europe’s first factory dedicated to making human food from electricity and air. The factory’s owner, Solar Foods, has started production at a site in Vantaa, near the Finnish capital of Helsinki, that will be able to produce 160 tonnes of food a year. It follows several years of experimenting at lab scale. Solar Foods has already gained novel food approval for solein in Singapore, and is seeking to introduce its products in the US this autumn, followed by the EU by the end of 2025 – and the UK too, if the regulator can get through the deluge of cannabis-related products. The factory’s output may be small in terms of the global food industry, but Pasi Vainikka, the Solar Foods co-founder and chief executive, hopes that proving its technology works will be a crucial step in revolutionising what humans eat. Food and agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of all planet-heating carbon emissions. Its share of pollution is likely to grow as other industries shift to using green electricity, and ever-expanding middle-classes demand more meat for their tables. Up to now the focus for some climate campaigners has been to try to persuade people to eat less meat and more plants. Non-farmed proteins such as solein might make that approach more appealing. Solein comes in the form of a yellowish powder made up of single-cell organisms, similar to yeast used in baking or beer-making. The company is hoping for those proteins to be used in meat alternatives, cheese and milkshakes, and as an egg replacement ingredient in noodles, pasta and mayonnaise. The ravioli it served up this week was made with solein replacing egg, with a solein version of cream cheese. The Finnish confectioner Fazer has already sold chocolate bars in Singapore with added solein (which is also a handy source of iron for vegans). A Singaporean restaurant last year created a solein chocolate gelato, replacing dairy milk. Vainikka was researching renewable energy systems at a Finnish research institute in 2014 when he met his co-founder, Juha-Pekka Pitkänen, a bioprocesses scientist. Pitkänen told him of soil-dwelling microbes that release the energy they need to live from oxidising hydrogen (rather than the glucose used by humans, for instance). Together they built a 200-litre fermenter in a garage near Helsinki, to prove the technology could be used for food, but then went into the wild “finding new potatoes to grow”. All Vainikka will say on solein’s origins is that they found it somewhere “close to shore” in the Baltic Sea. Almost all food consumed by humans at the moment ultimately comes from plants, which use energy from the sun for photosynthesis. That process converts carbon dioxide and water into the molecules they need to grow. Solar Foods instead uses the same renewable electricity from the sun to split water apart. It then feeds the hydrogen and oxygen to the microbes in a brewing vessel, plus carbon dioxide captured from the air from the company’s office ventilation system. The claim that the proteins are made out of thin air is “never more than 95% true”, says Vainnika: 5% of the mixture in the brewing vessel is a solution containing other minerals needed by cells, such as iron, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus. The microbes are then pasteurised (killing them), then dried in a centrifuge and with hot air. That leaves a powder that can be used in food. The process could also use CO2 from, for instance, burning fuels – although the molecule would end up back in the atmosphere once humans eat the solein and breathe out the carbon again. The real climate benefits from solein come from cutting the vast tracts of land used – and abused through deforestation on an epic scale – for animal feed and pasture. Instead, renewed forests could trap carbon. Efficient US farmers get 3.3 tonnes of soya beans from each harvest of a hectare, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. By contrast, Solar Foods’ pilot factory takes up a fifth of a hectare to produce 160 tonnes a year. “As we can relieve pressures on agricultural land, they can rewild and return to being climate sinks,” Vainikka says. Other companies are pursuing the same dream. Dozens are using microbes to create animal feed, although they often require sugars or fossil fuel feedstocks. One US rival, Air Protein, has opened a factory in California using similar “hydrogenotrophs” – hydrogen eaters. It has the backing of the food multinational Archer-Daniels-Midland, the British bank Barclays and GV (formerly Google Ventures). The Dutch company Deep Branch, which is making fish food, claims its Proton protein will be 60% less carbon-intensive than conventional proteins. Deep Branch is looking at taking the CO2 produced by the UK biomass power generator Drax. The companies have produced their test products. Now they face the challenge of proving their technology works at scale. Vainikka says that is the key problem for cultured meat, or lab-grown meat. The market value of newly listed companies such as Beyond Meat soared during the coronavirus pandemic bubble, only to come crashing down as sales slumped. The opening of Solar Foods’ first factory will be crucial in persuading investors that the company will not suffer the same fate. With meat protein, which is much more expensive than plants or cellular agriculture, there is simply no competition on price for each kilo. But Solar Foods and rivals could face other problems. Conservative politicians particularly in the US and Italy have identified lab-grown food as a threat to their ranching and farming cultures. Vainikka argues that these fears are misplaced. He wants “coexistence of new and old”, with artisanal, high-quality farms remaining alongside cell farming that can deliver cheap, bulk foods. He argues it is “the opportunity of the century for the meat industry” to focus on quality rather than churning out as much cheap (and heavily subsidised) meat as possible. And plant agriculture will also remain, he argues. “The future is not powder: the main body of food will still come through plants,” he says. The occasional “salami with the cultural heritage, that can remain. The meat in your lasagne during lunch will be done by cellular agriculture.”",

        "title": "Fee hikes will price us out of canals, say houseboaters in England and Wales",
        "content": "Finding an affordable place to live on land is hard enough. Now, those who call canals and rivers home face being priced out of the water after plans came into effect to start increasing licence fees by up to 75%. Houseboats have long been the reserve of those living alternative lifestyles, but in recent years young people and families have flocked to them as rents across the country, especially in London, have soared. “In London, people just can’t afford to live in houses any more,” said Max Granger, 30, who has lived on a narrowboat by Victoria Park for two years. “There is a lot more young families and people on boats than you would think. Some made the move because they were interested in boats, others because of high rents.” The Canal &amp; River Trust (CRT) is introducing a surcharge for “continuous cruisers” of up to 75% above the standard fee over the next five years for the largest boats. These are people who can temporarily moor along canals and rivers as long as they move every two weeks. All boat licence fees will increase above inflation year on year, with surcharges for continuous cruisers and wider boats. Granger said the increase would not massively affect him, but for others it will be devastating. Andrea, 41, a psychotherapist, has lived on boats for 10 years. She is a single parent to a seven-year-old son. “It’s his home, he loves it. It’s what he’s known his whole life,” she said. About two and a half years ago, she had a stroke. “I was still able to have a roof over my head because I lived on a boat,” she said. In the years since, she has had to work part-time due to post-stroke fatigue, which has hit her income. On its website, the CRT recommends continuous cruising licences for those with no geographical ties, excluding those with children attending school. Andrea said the CRT had told her to permanently moor her boat, the cost of which can creep into the thousands of pounds every month. A continuous cruising licence costs on average under £200 a month. “I can’t afford a home mooring because there aren’t any affordable ones available,” she said. She said it was “terrifying” to think about what she would do when the rising fees came into effect. “Am I someone who could afford to live in accommodation as a single parent? No. I can’t imagine being able to rent somewhere for me and my child. Not with prices in London.” Toby Osmond, an actor, bought a boat five years ago after receiving an inheritance payment. At first, his yearly costs came in at under £1,000. “Now a six-month licence costs about a grand,” he said. “The CRT keeps changing the goalpost, it’s like having a cowboy landlord!” He previously lived in house shares and, most recently, in an east London warehouse. The CRT is responsible for maintaining rivers and canals in England and Wales. “They haven’t done the requisite maintenance,” said Osmond. “We get rid of trees floating in the river. Earlier today I was fishing out plastic.” Those who live along canals and rivers also act as a watchful eye for people passing by, especially at night. “We’ve stopped crime. About 20 to 30 years ago, when there were less boats here, you wouldn’t think of stepping foot on a towpath. Now, because there’s people here, it’s a lot safer,” he said. Osmond said that those working in the arts who are yet to find their feet will be losing another form of housing that enables them to be in the country’s cultural capitals. As for his own plans, he is retraining to work in construction to keep up with the costs. “I’m hoping I can keep on acting, and compared to other people I know I’m doing pretty well, but it’s just becoming untenable,” he said. The CRT said: “As the cost of looking after the canal network spirals, we must raise money from all sources. Boats are central to the network and we try to keep their contribution affordable – the average licence costs around £850 a year. “We are, however, asking those with wider boats and those who use the network most to pay slightly more. We will do all we can to support those struggling wherever possible and have a welfare support team who can help boaters who are facing financial difficulties or other challenges.” • The headline and text of this article were amended on 19 April 2024.

        "title": "‘We’re by no means out of the woods yet’: workers face uncertainty over Alstom train plant",
        "content": "“It’s strange at the moment: everywhere’s so quiet. It’s not good.” Mick Waldram has worked at Alstom’s sprawling train manufacturing plant on Litchurch Lane in Derby for 20 years, like his parents before him, and has watched in recent months as its six production lines have been gradually mothballed. “I’ve been here 20 years and my brother’s been here 20 years as well,” Waldram says. “My mum was the managing director’s secretary, she was here 38 years, and my dad was a projects engineer who was here 36 years. We want to stay here. Me and my brother are not looking at leaving, we want to stay here if possible, do another 20 years.” Talks with the transport secretary, Mark Harper, on Tuesday raised hopes that a new order for 10 trains on London’s crowded Elizabeth line would safeguard the future of manufacturing at this historic site, which started work in the 1840s. But after months of gnawing uncertainty for the 1,300 manufacturing staff whose jobs are at risk, and with kit standing idle and suppliers shuttered, no one is taking anything for granted. “I don’t think we’re there yet: if you read the wording from the government, there’s caveats in there, there’s get out of jail cards,” says Darren Spencer, a production manager at the site and a rep for the Unite union. “We’re by no means out of the woods yet.” Harper said he had reached an “agreement in principle” with Alstom on the 10 trains, subject to value for money for the taxpayer, adding that he was confident “a solution is now in sight”. He and the trains minister, Huw Merriman, have stressed the complexity of the issue. But the Labour MP and shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, says it could have been resolved long ago. “Mark Harper has spent months claiming a deal to save jobs at Alstom was out of his hands. It is shameful that he has had to be dragged kicking and screaming under pressure from Labour, the industry and Unite, just to come back to the table,” Haigh said. She added: “Ministers need to end this cycle of chaos on our railways and develop a consistent rail procurement strategy to give certainty to manufacturers.” Unite has worked in an unusually close double act with senior management at Alstom, in an attempt to convince the government that while future projections for the rail industry are upbeat, Litchurch Lane faces a potentially unbridgeable gap in its order schedule. Staff and managers feared that could lead to hundreds of jobs and decades of expertise being lost – and new contracts being fulfilled overseas. The cost of the downturn in orders is already evident onsite, where hundreds of workers gathered to mark the last train rolling off the production line late last month. Some have already taken voluntary redundancy, with more due to leave in the coming weeks. One contractor based at Litchurch Lane, Paintbox, went into administration last year when its work painting new carriages dried up – although some of its staff have been taken on by Alstom. Motherson, which did the wiring on the trains, pulled out of the site. Another Alstom supplier, Solo Rail Solutions, in Birmingham, which made the doors, appointed administrators earlier this month. With rail woven deeply into Derby’s local economy as well as its heritage, the campaign to close the gap in Alstom’s order book has attracted the support of scores of local businesses – with the slogan displayed on a giant banner at Derby County’s Pride Park ground during last weekend’s match. Football fan Luke Brame, who completed his apprenticeship at the site and has worked there for nine years, says he feels proud of his handiwork as he travels around to watch matches. “I quite like working here because I go on trains a lot for football. It’s quite cool when you go on one and you think: ‘I built this one,’” he says. “I’m waiting to see what the future is really. I haven’t gone for voluntary redundancy because I don’t know what else I want to do, and I want to carry on the legacy that the older people have left me.” While his day job is usually welding, for the moment there is nothing for him to weld. If the order for the 10 Elizabeth line trains is confirmed – extending an existing contract – Alstom plans to restart production in Derby on a slimmed-down basis, with three or four production lines brought back into action, until work is due to start on 54 trains for HS2, in a year or so. That contract is a joint venture with Hitachi, which is also warning about potential job losses at its Newton Aycliffe factory in County Durham, without help from the government to bring forward orders. Harper met representatives from the factory this week, and the Department for Transport insists that – as with Alstom – they are seeking a solution. The French multinational Alstom inherited the vast Derby site – the biggest in the world outside China – when it bought the Canadian company Bombardier’s train business in 2021, as the industry emerged from the financial earthquake of the Covid pandemic. Work servicing and refurbishing much of the UK’s passenger rail fleet continues here, as does engineering and design, which were never at risk; but manufacturing has been halted for now. Campaigners who have fought for the future of the site welcomed Harper’s announcement this week – but lamented the months of brinkmanship and bureaucracy it took to get here. “This is an unnecessary journey that we’ve just been on,” says John Forkin, the managing director of Marketing Derby, the city’s inward investment agency, which corralled hundreds of local businesses to throw their weight behind Litchurch Lane. They wrote to Harper earlier this week, calling on him to “save our trains: do the deal”. “We will still be seeking meetings with ministers about the future of trains,” Forkin says, citing the fate of up to 15,000 jobs in the local supply chain, many at small companies. “We’ve got to stop this boom and bust. We should be able to plan it a lot better. We have to stop doing this.” Back at Litchurch Lane, the cloud of uncertainty lingers. Chloe Turnbull works in “methods engineering”, shuttling between the desk-based engineers and the hands-on production workers she trained with. “If there’s any issues that come up during the production of the trains, I’m here to get your engineering drawings and stuff like that.” “This is my fourth year now. I did my apprenticeship for the first three years. I went down the whole production line from start to finish,” she says. “The more I can be learning now the better, and obviously the thought of not having anything any more, and going to find something else is so stressful. So I’m very stressed and upset, because I enjoy it.”",

        "title": "Retail sales in Great Britain flatline as households continue to feel squeeze",
        "content": "Retail sales in Great Britain unexpectedly stalled in March as consumers cut back on spending because of the cost of living, according to new data. British retail sales volumes stagnated at 0% in March after an increase of 0.1% in February, according to the Office for National Statistics. The figures were worse than the 0.3% sales growth expected by economists polled by Reuters as a contraction in food sales and department stores offset higher sales elsewhere. “Retail sales registered no growth in March. Hardware stores, furniture shops, petrol stations and clothing stores all reported a rise in sales,” said Heather Bovill, an ONS senior statistician. “However, these gains were offset by falling food sales and in department stores where retailers say higher prices hit trading. Looking at the longer-term picture, across the latest three months retail sales increased after a poor Christmas.” On an annual basis, sales volumes rose 0.8% over the year to March 2024, weaker than the 1% expected. The gloomy figures underline the dilemma for the Bank of England over when to start cutting interest rates, as it grapples with the twin threat of weak growth and higher than expected inflation in March. Earlier this week, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said he expected a sharp fall in inflation, which now stands at 3.2%, next month. Figures this week also showed the jobs market had cooled as the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%. Decisions on interest rates would be influenced by service sector inflation, earnings growth and the state of the labour market, Bailey said. Alex Kerr, an assistant economist at Capital Economics, said the outlook for 2024 was brighter because of the prospect of interest rate cuts and a boost to consumers from falling inflation and the 2p cut to national insurance in April. “However, today’s release may mean that the Bank of England is less worried about the possibility of a US-style resurgence in GDP growth and stalling in disinflation,” he added. Lisa Hooker, the PwC leader of industry for consumer markets, said: “What is clear is that the first quarter of the year has been disappointing for many retailers. Lower inflation and the first 2% cut to national insurance, which was felt in January’s pay packets, have yet to translate into a sustained recovery in spending.” She also said she was “optimistic that the picture will improve from April onwards”, particularly if inflation hits the Bank of England’s 2% target, as many economists predict.",

        "title": "UK supermarkets accused of misleading labelling on origins of food products",
        "content": "“Misleading” and “inconsistent” labels make it hard for shoppers to know where their food comes from, the consumer champion Which? has said, as it found supermarket chains were selling products with “meaningless” statements on their packaging. Retailers must supply the “country of origin” for specific foods including fresh fruit and vegetables, unprocessed meats, fish, wine and olive oil but the rules do not generally apply to processed meat or frozen or processed fruit and vegetables. However, Which? researchers on store visits found that, even when the country of origin was required, it was sometimes missing in store, as was the case with loose cauliflowers, courgettes and onions at Sainsbury’s and peppers, melons and mangoes at Asda. Two-thirds of people surveyed by Which? said they thought it was important to know where fresh fruit and vegetables came from. Half of respondents said it was also important to know the origin of processed and tinned meat. Which? also highlighted inconsistencies. A whole own-label pineapple in Tesco carried the country of origin, while a packet of pineapple chunks in the next aisle did not. This is within the rules but not particularly helpful for shoppers, the consumer group said. In other cases, Which? complained that labels were misleading or, worse still, meaningless. Aldi’s Crestwood bacon and cheese wraps were an example of the former as they showed union jacks and the claim “Made in Britain” on the front of the packet but on the back of the products revealed they contained EU pork. A pack of gammon joints at Iceland was labelled as “EU and non-EU origin” – a statement that was described as “meaningless”. Analysts counter that this type of label is intended to inform customers that the product contained a blend of an ingredients from different countries, including UK sources. Ele Clark, the retail editor at Which?, said that, even when the rules were being followed, consumers were not getting all the information they wanted. “Supermarkets should particularly focus on labelling loose fruit and vegetables more clearly, but manufacturers and retailers should also consider providing origin information on more processed meat products so shoppers are armed with the information they need to make informed choices,” she added. Which? said it planned to share its findings with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which this year announced a consultation on food labelling to improve transparency so consumers can “make informed decisions”. Separately, post-Brexit government plans will require all meat and dairy products sold in the UK to be labelled “not for EU” from October, which food producers say could add £250m a year to their costs. Sainsbury’s and Asda said they had stringent processes in place to ensure country of origin is clearly displayed at the shelf edge and on products themselves where applicable. Aldi said it worked hard to ensure that all its labelling complied with the rules. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, an assistant director of food at the lobby group the British Retail Consortium, said retailers attempted to ensure they “followed all legal guidelines where country of origin labelling was required. Furthermore, they go above and beyond to voluntarily provide this information in many circumstances where it is not a legal requirement.”",

        "content": "So ends a stock market experiment that is unlikely to be repeated in a hurry: Hipgnosis Songs Fund, the music royalties company with songs by the likes of Beyoncé, Blondie and Chic, is to be sold to a US fund for less than its starting price in 2018 of 100p. The immediate point is that 93p a share, or £1.1bn, is a lot better than shareholders were looking at in recent months. The price went as low as 60p during the company’s bust-up with its own investment adviser, a suspension of dividends (unforgivable for a fund designed to turn royalties into income) and a writedown in the value of assets after a tortuous debate about valuation methodologies. Those shareholders voted last year against “continuation”, in the lingo of investment trusts, which amounted to an order to the board to find a new strategy and establish some hard value. Robert Naylor came in as chair last November and has found a credible buyer in the form of Concord Chorus, a fund ultimately backed by state pension money in Michigan; the same US fund last year bought Round Hill Music, the only other UK-listed royalty fund. For Hipgnosis investors, 93p doesn’t represent Good Times, to pick on one song in the portfolio, but nor is it a reason to (Le) Freak out. It’s a smidgeon above the revised asset value; on the other hand, the asset value may increase by a notch or two by the time the deal completes. There is also an entertaining subplot whereby the fund is inviting its investment adviser – a firm majority-owned by Blackstone but with Hipgnosis pioneer Merck Mercuriadis on lead vocals – to go quietly by terminating its management contract, to allow an extra $25m (£20m) to flow to shareholders. We’ll wait to see how that request is received given the past toxicity of the relationship. But the longer-term point demonstrated by Hipgnosis’s entertaining life as a FTSE 250 stock is that this type of “alternative” asset is ill-suited to public markets. As soon as interest rates started to rise, the share price wobbled. Then came the kerfuffle over valuation techniques in an illiquid market for back catalogues, plus the tensions with Blackstone and Mercuriadis. And it all happened within the context of an industry-wide lack of transparency over the price at which catalogues are bought and sold. In the circumstances, Naylor is surely spot on when he says the fund would have to undergo “substantial financial and governance changes” to improve its share price materially under its own steam, and that the alternatives “carry significant risks, uncertainties and limitations”. You bet: in an investment trust sector where discounts to published asset values are already the norm, you don’t want to add complications on top. Selling up at 93p is reasonable. Shareholders with a combined stake of 29% have already backed the decision. The shame is that the basic idea had appeal: a broad and constantly refreshed portfolio of music rights should be able to provide a stable source of income. But pension money, with its multi-decade investment horizons, looks a more natural owner, away from public markets. Hipgnosis was just too noisy.",

        "content": "Nestlé has fought off investor proposals that would have forced the world’s largest consumer goods company to cut back on high levels of salt, sugar and fats in its food and drinks. The Swiss-headquartered multinational won the backing of 88% of shareholder votes at its annual meeting on Thursday, while 11% backed the resolution. Nestlé had urged investors to reject the proposal, arguing a move away from “indulgent products” could harm its “strategic freedom”. Five institutional investors with $1.68tn (£1.35tn) in assets under management, including Legal &amp; General Investment Management, said they were concerned about the reputational risks to the company, as well as the health effects associated with an overreliance on indulgent foods. The shareholders – led by the campaign group ShareAction – pointed to research by the University of Oxford and the youth activist charity BiteBack. The non-governmental organisation recently found that about 70% of Nestlé’s sales in the UK were of foods high in fat, salt and sugar. Simon Rawson, the deputy chief executive of ShareAction, said: “While the vote we achieved today may be less than we wanted, the direction of travel is clear. Investors and consumers are recognising the importance of addressing the business risks and public health impacts of an industry that is heavily reliant on the sales of unhealthy food. They have growing expectations not only from Nestlé but from all food manufacturers.” Nestlé, which is listed in Zurich and owns brands including KitKat and Yorkie chocolate bars and Quality Street sweets, said its own figures showed that 60% of sales, excluding pet food, came from “more nutritious or specialised nutrition products”, and only 21% of its portfolio was focused on indulgent foods. In video message to shareholders, its chair, Paul Bulcke, said Nestlé had always been committed to helping consumers make informed choices as part of a balanced diet. “Of course, this also includes enjoying moments of indulgence, good chocolate for example, from time to time and in a responsible way,” he said. “A small group of shareholders led by the NGO ShareAction wants us to disengage from indulgent products. This is wrong. It will restrict Nestlé’s strategic freedom and limit management’s ability to make decisions or responsible decisions. The shareholders’ proposal is not in our best interest, not for our consumers, and not for you.” In September, Nestlé put forward a nutrition target to sell “more nutritious” products by 2030. ShareAction said it fell far short of investor expectations. ShareAction said the nutritious sales target was simply in line with Nestlé’s overall growth forecasts and made no commitment on the sale of unhealthy products, which could increase at a similar rate. As a result, it would not shift Nestlé’s reliance on sales of unhealthy products. The target also includes products such as coffee that have no nutritional value, it added.",

        "title": "Thames Water nationalisation plan could move bulk of £15bn debt to state",
        "content": "Thames Water could be renationalised, with the bulk of its £15.6bn debt added to the public purse, under radical plans being considered by the government, the Guardian can reveal. The blueprint, codenamed Project Timber, is being drawn up in Whitehall and would turn Britain’s biggest water company into a publicly owned arm’s-length body. Some lenders to its core operating company could lose up to 40% of their money under the plans. The contingency planning, which is at an advanced stage, reflects the deep concern in Whitehall about the state of a company that has become a symbol of the failure of privatisation in public utilities. It had no debt when it was taken out of public ownership in 1989. One of the UK’s biggest nationalisations in more than a decade would pull Thames’ vast liabilities into the government’s debt figures. A new arm’s-length public corporation would be formed to hold the water monopoly, modelled on the company that built the £18.8bn Crossrail project. The company serves 16 million customers in the London and Thames valley regions, but its finances have been left threadbare after previous shareholders siphoned out billions of pounds of dividends and it was hit with hefty fines for pollution and leaks. Its parent company, Kemble, recently defaulted on its debt and Thames has said it has enough money in its operating company to last for 15 months. Renationalisation would be deeply damaging for the government during an election year, reversing the privatisation carried out by Margaret Thatcher’s administration. Still, with Thames’ crisis likely to run beyond the expected autumn election, it may be a new Labour government that is faced with the challenge of salvaging the water monopoly. The blueprint is being led by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Treasury. The plans for a special administration of Thames are based on the assumption that Kemble is wiped out and its lenders, who are owed about £3bn, are not recompensed from the public purse. Some bondholders for the operating company – which sits within a regulatory ringfence – may also see the value of their loans cut by as much as 35%-40%, according to figures that underpin the potential nationalisation and have been seen by the Guardian. In April, the Guardian revealed Thames’ plans to further tap bond markets, even amid acute concerns among existing bondholders about the write downs they may be forced to make on their existing loans to the company’s operating arm. However, the lenders likely to bear the most pain under renationalisation would be the smaller share of creditors to Thames, known as category B bondholders, who hold about £1.6bn of Thames’ operating company debt. The vast majority of category A bondholders, who are owed about £13bn, would face a smaller “haircut” of about 5%-10% under a central scenario, although this could rise to 25% in a more extreme scenario. These figures are slightly more severe than some industry estimates from bondholders seen by the Guardian; in these B bondholders would lose about 30% of their money in a worst-case scenario and category A lenders would be forced to take 5% haircuts. Shareholders in Thames, which include the funds giants USS and Omers, would have their entire investment in Thames wiped out under the renationalisation plans. However, forcing lenders to bear financial pain would be highly controversial, given Thames’ creditors include some of the world’s biggest asset managers, which lent to the company on the assumption that their investment carried the same gold-plated risk rating as government debt. Whitehall and the regulator, Ofwat, were still optimistic that a nationalisation may be avoided, sources said. While public corporations are known as arm’s-length bodies, the move would ultimately allow the government far greater control and scrutiny of Thames’ day-to-day operations, sources said, speeding up its reform and return to the private sector. The company could be broken up into a “London Water” company to serve the capital and a “Thames Valley” firm to look after the rest. Still, the level of control assumed by the government will be a key factor in determining how the Office for National Statistics (ONS) judges it should be accounted for within the national debt. Thames has about £19bn of assets, ranging from 20,000 miles of water pipes to reservoirs and sewage treatment works, as well as its £15.6bn debt pile. Whether or not liabilities land on the government’s balance sheet often depends on the level of control it exerts over it. In 2014 the £30bn debt at the track and station owner, Network Rail, was added to the public purse after it was reclassified as a public body by the ONS. However, in 2017 housing associations’ £66bn debt was reclassified as private after the then communities secretary, Sajid Javid, relinquished “just enough” control. Sources at Ofwat are confident Thames’ operating company will be an attractive prospect for private sector investors once its parent company is wiped out, and a new plan for its finances and governance is secured. If the company can convince Ofwat with its new turnaround plan and business plan, due within days, it might yet be able to hike consumers’ bills by nearly 40%. Ofwat is due to rule on that business plan at its 23 May board meeting. It is understood Thames could also face some leniency on fines for its failure to meet performance targets if it is renationalised, given the problems of fining a state-owned body. Ofwat has the ability to censure Thames in three ways: via fines which put the money straight into the public purse, by rebates to consumers, or by securing undertakings. With much of its assets buried underground, Thames and the regulator have struggled to get to grips with the true state of its ageing infrastructure. Thames has increased its claims in recent years about the poor condition of its underlying assets as its financial struggles have become plain. Ofwat, meanwhile, has sought to gather its own intelligence on the state of Thames’ assets, and believes the company’s challenges are similar to those of other water operators who are not making the same financial claims regarding their business plans. A Defra spokesperson said: “As a responsible government, we prepare for a range of scenarios across our regulated industries – including water – as the public would expect.” A spokesperson for Thames Water referred the Guardian to its 28 March statement and said the talks with Ofwat and other stakeholders were ongoing. “Thames Water intends to pursue all options to secure the required equity investment from new or existing shareholders,” the statement said. A spokesperson for Ofwat declined to comment.",

        "title": "Russia’s war in Ukraine remains barrier to growth, says IMF chief",
        "content": "Russia’s war with Ukraine is stoking geopolitical tensions and damaging the recovery prospects of the global economy, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned. Kristalina Georgieva urged an end to the two-year conflict, saying it was both a human tragedy and a barrier to growth. As G7 finance ministers said they were looking at ways of using the almost $300bn (£240bn) of seized Russian assets to help Ukraine, the IMF managing director said support for Kyiv remained “steady and firm”. Georgieva said Ukraine would need $42bn of financial support this year. The G7 group of leading developed countries said it would “continue working on all possible avenues by which immobilised Russian sovereign assets could be made use of to support Ukraine, consistent with international law and our respective legal systems”. The communique released after the meeting in Washington also hinted at tougher sanctions against Iran following last weekend’s missile and drone attack on Israel. “We will ensure close coordination of any future measure to diminish Iran’s ability to acquire, produce, or transfer weapons to support its destabilising regional activities,” the G7 said. Most of the seized Russian assets are being held in Europe, and the European Central Bank is concerned that outright seizure would result in tit-for-tat retaliation from Moscow and may contravene international law. One idea being pursued is to pull forward the interest payments on frozen Russian assets – estimated at between €3bn to €5bn (£2.6bn to £4.3bn) a year – so that they can be used as collateral for loans or bonds to support Ukraine. The UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the G7 had reluctantly concluded that the war in Ukraine was not going to end any time soon and would require a longer term commitment. Georgieva said the sooner the conflicts in Ukraine and in Gaza ended the better it would be for the global economy. “The war in Ukraine is a tragedy for its people. Having men, women and children killed and wounded is a daily occurrence. We need to end this war for their sake and for the sake of the world economy,” she said. Six months of fighting between Israel and Hamas had meant Gaza’s economy had been “wiped out”, Georgieva said. “Eighty per cent of it is gone. The West Bank has also been impacted.” Speaking at a press conference at the IMF’s spring meeting, Georgieva said: “The world has grappled with multiple shocks – the pandemic, a cost of living crisis, war and conflict, and climate disasters. The twenties has already been a turbulent decade.” Countries had acted to mitigate the impact of the shocks of the past four years, but it was now time to rebuild buffers, the IMF chief said. “Fiscal restraint is becoming more important. Countries must rebuild their fiscal resilience to be ready for the next shock.” The IMF’s world economic outlook released this week showed the US economy was on course to grow more than three times as rapidly as the eurozone this year – 2.7% increase in gross domestic product against 0.8%. Georgieva said there were three factors that explained the disparity. First, the US was better at harnessing innovation so that new ideas could be turned into successful businesses. There was still “work to be done” to unleash innovation in Europe, Georgieva said, citing the costs of patents in Europe compared with in the US. Second, migration. While the record number of people coming into the US across its southern borders has become a big political issue, Georgieva said its economy was benefitting from “abundant” labour coming into the country. “It creates a domestic political problem, and not everyone who crosses the border adds positively to the economy,” she said. “But that labour supply also gives to the US another comparative advantage; wages are not pushing up, because there is no strong pressure because of a lack of labour on wage growth.” Third, was that the US had benefitted from more favourable energy prices than Europe, where natural gas prices soared after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Georgieva said.",

        "title": "IMF’s Georgieva says border migration is helping US outperform Europe; UK car insurance prices finally falling – as it happened",
        "content": "Time to wrap up… here’s today’s main stories so far: The price of cocoa has hit a new record high today, pushed up by escalating worries over shrinking supplies due to crop failures in west Africa. The London cocoa price hit £9,477 per ton today, as industry data showed a drop in production. “Grindings” — beans processed by the industry to eventually be turned into chocolate — fell by 2.5% in the first three months of the year. That could show that weaker production is resulting in fewer beans reaching the market. Coffee also hit new highs, with the robusta coffee price climbing to a record $4,292 per ton. Gareth Redmond-King, head of international programme at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) says: “The cost of our morning coffee is soaring as climate change hits crops in Brazil and Vietnam. The UK imported a billion pounds worth of coffee in 2023; just over half in raw coffee beans, and the rest as roasted coffee. “But 97% of all coffee globally is grown in countries vulnerable to climate impacts. More than half the coffee beans we imported last year came from Brazil and Vietnam - worth £198m and £87m respectively. Between them they also supply half the beans imported by EU nations to make roasted coffee we also import. Back in Washington, the IMF is warning Asia’s central banks not to follow the US Federal reserve too closely. The Fund’s advice is that Asian central banks should focus on domestic inflation and avoid tying their policy decisions too closely to anticipated moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Otherwise, it fears, central banks could undermine price stability in their own countries by following the Fed too closely. The IMF’s staff analysis showed that U.S. interest rates have a “strong and immediate” impact on Asian financial conditions and exchange rates, Krishna Srinivasan, director of the lender’s Asia and Pacific department, said today. Srinivasan explained: “Expectations about Fed easing have fluctuated in recent months, driven by factors that are unrelated to Asian price stability needs. “We recommend Asian central banks to focus on domestic inflation, and avoid making their policy decisions overly dependent on anticipated moves by the Federal Reserve. Predictions that the Fed will not cut interest rates as soon, or as sharply, as expected have pushed up the US dollar against Asia-Pacific currencies such as the yen (which has hit a 30-year low) and the won. New jobless claims data today has shown that the US labour market remains in good shape. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits was unchanged at 212,000, last week, which is a historically low level. That suggests the increase in migration identified by Kristalina Georgieva today is not leading to an increase in unemployment. Georgieva also says that the Middle East conflict has led to a growth downgrade for the region. Gaza’s economy has been wiped out, she warns, while the West Bank has been severely impacted. Ukraine needs $42bn of budget support this year as it continues to resist Russia’s invasion, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva says. Georgieva also told reporters in Washington that global support for Ukraine remains firm, and that the war needs to end; it is both a human tragedy and a drag on global growth prospects, she says. Kristalina Georgieva also warned that the twenties has already been a turbulent decade, in which the global economy was hit by multiple shocks— including the Covid-19 pandemic, a cost-of-living crisis, war and conflict, and climate disasters. International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva also called for China to boost domestic demand for goods and services, including health care. This, she told reporters in Washington, would help bolster its growth prospects. Georgieva today’s news conference that China needed to give consumers more confidence and more things to buy and get the social safety nets to work more effectively. She said the world’s second largest economy also needed to resolve problems in its property sector, which would help restore consumer confidence. Over in Washington, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva has said that the high levels of migration across the US border is helping America’s economy to outpace Europe. Asked why the US economy has performed better than Europe, at the Fund’s annnual meeting in Washington today, Georgieva cited three factors that distinguish the US. First, the force of innovation – in the US it’s easier to turn innovative ideas into business development and then scaled up into successful businesses. There’s still “work to be done” to unleash innovation in Europe, she says, citing the costs of patents in Europe vs the US. The second factor, Georgieva says, is the influx of workers into the US, which makes it easier for firms to find staff and puts downward pressure on wages. [That spike in migration to unprecedented levels at the southern border is a major political issue, and likely to dominate the presidential election this autumn]. Georgieva explains: Second, the US is benefitting from abundant labour coming across the border. It creates a domestic political problem, and not everyone who crosses the border adds positively to the economy. But that labour supply also gives to the US another comparative advantage; wages are not pushing up, because there is no strong pressure because of a lack of labor on wage growth. The third factor in the US’s favour is that it has benefitted from more favourable energy prices than Europe, where natural gas prices soared after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Georgieva also reveals that the issue of productivity dominates her thinking; she says: I wake up in the middle the night and think, how we can help our members lift their productivity? Steve Dukes, CEO at Confused.com, says: “While the cost of car insurance may have dropped at the beginning of this year, customers are still paying historically high prices for their car insurance. Premiums are still more expensive year-on-year, so as an industry, there’s still an important role to play in helping customers to understand where they could be saving money.” Today’s report also highlights that the deployment of vehicles with advanced technology will put upward pressure on premiums (as high-tech cars are more expensive to fix). Today’s report shows that the South West of England continues to be the cheapest region for car insurance, with average premiums now costing £606. But Inner London was the most expensive region with average prices at £1501, even though car insurance premiums here fell by £106 in the last three months. The surge in UK car insurance premiums may finally be fading, bringing some relief to squeezed motorists. Data published by Confused.com and insurance broker WTW shows that comprehensive car insurance premiums fell fallen by 5% (£54) during the last three months, with UK motorists now paying £941 on average. Although that’s a quarterly fall, it’s still an awful lot more than a year ago. In Q1 2023, the average premium was £657, meaning they’re still 43% higher than a year ago! Tim Rourke, UK head of P&amp;C pricing, product, claims and underwriting at WTW, says: “After a series of record highs in 2023 took car insurance premiums into uncharted territory, the latest pricing data suggests the relentless rise in prices may finally be turning a corner.” We reported last month that UK car insurance premiums jumped by 34% in 2023, as motor insurers more than passed on the rising cost of claims. Morgan Stanley has pushed back their forecast for the first Bank of England interest rate cut to June, from May, following yesterday’s inflation report. They expect the BoE to cutting in June (as opposed to May previously) and to deliver 75 basis points of cuts this year (three quarter-point cuts, in June, August, November). They also argue that March’s inflation report, showing the CPI index fell to 3.2% from 3.4% in February, doesn’t change “the fundamental picture” that price pressures are subsiding. They add: Given Governor Bailey’s comments at the IMF following the pay and inflation data, we think that the core of the MPC likely agrees with our initial take – these data should not fundamentally alter one’s stance on the economic outlook. Fresh questions over BP’s low carbon ambitions have emerged today with a major shakeup of the oil company’s executive team, including the resignation of its gas and renewables boss. BP’s head of natural gas and low carbon energy, Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, will step down after just over two years after she joined the company to spearhead the green agenda set out by BP’s former boss Bernard Looney. The new CEO, Murray Auchincloss, said she will be replaced by BP “lifer” William Lin who joined the company almost three decades ago and currently serves as head of the company’s regions, corporates &amp; solutions division. At the same time BP’s head of innovation and technology, Leigh-Ann Russell, will also leave to take up an external job opportunity, the company said. Auchincloss set out his plans for a smaller leadership team as he aims to simplify BP’s management structure in a cost-cutting drive which will reportedly include cutting over a tenth of the workforce in its electric vehicle charging business and pulling out of several markets. He said earlier this year that BP’s destination was unchanged but that it would get there as a much simpler and more pragmatic company, and at the pace that society demands. Giacomo Romeo, an analyst at Jefferies, said that the shakeup confirmed its view that we could see more changes around BP’s strategy for low carbon businesses as the company seeks a more “pragmatic approach” to the energy transition. In a memo to staff, Dotzenrath said: “After a rewarding career of over 30 years in energy, I am at a point where I need to devote more time to my family.” “I firmly believe we have the right asset footprint and pipeline, partnerships, financial strength and most importantly the right team to deliver.” Germany’s central bank is hopeful that Europe’s largest member will avoid falling into recession, after a pick-up in activity at the start of this year. The Bundesbank has predicted this morning that the German economy probably expanded in the first quarter, thanks to an unexpected boost from industry and construction. The Bundesbank had previously predicted that GDP would shrink in the first three months of 2024, which would have put Germany into a technical recession (two quarterly contractions in a row), after it shrank in Q4 2023. But today, the Bundesbank declares that Germany’s economic situation has brightened somewhat, meaning there may have been a slight increase in growth in Q1 2024. It warns, though, that the outlook remains poor, saying: “There is still no evidence of sustained improvement for the German economy. Demand for industrial products from Germany and abroad remains weak and continues to decline.” UK companies trimmed their job adverts last week. The total number of online job adverts on 12 April 2024 decreased by 2% when compared with the previous week, the Office for National Statistics reports today. That left the total 19% lower than a year ago. The oil price has eased to its lowest level since the start of April. Brent crude is down 0.7% today at $86.66 per barrel, adding to a heavy drop yesterday. Last Friday, Brent traded as high as $92 per barrel, as investors braced for Iran to take military action against Israel. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, says the slump in oil prices is helping to lift sentiment in the markets today, adding: The risk of an escalation between Israel and Iran appears to be easing with each passing day, while yesterday’s fourth consecutive weekly gain for US crude inventories has signalled an oversupply despite a recent decline in US output. Yesterday’s smaller-than-expected fall in the UK’s inflation rate hasn’t had any immediate impact on the mortgage market. Moneyfacts have reported that average borrowing rates are unchanged this morning, saying: The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.81%. This is unchanged from the previous working day. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.39%. This is unchanged from the previous working day. The money markets this morning are pricing in a high chance that there are two cuts to UK interest rates this year, bringing Bank rate down to 4.75% in December from 5.25% today. Home furnishings group Dunelm has dampened the mood in the City a little today, by warning that consumer spending “remains under pressure”. Dunelm reported a 3% rise in total sales in the first quarter of this year, driven by increased volumes, even though both the homewares and furniture markets remained “challenging”. It added Trading conditions have continued to be volatile with March in particular seeing softer levels of demand. Dunelm shares are down almost 3% this morning, even though the company reported an increase in its profit margins as costs fall. The embattled British music royalties investment fund Hipgnosis, which owns the rights to songs by artists from Beyoncé to Neil Young, has agreed to a $1.4bn (£1.1bn) takeover by a music and theatrical rights rival after months of turmoil over the company’s structure and leadership. The Concord Chorus deal, which offers Hipgnosis shareholders a 32% premium to Thursday’s share price at $1.16 a share, could put an end to uncertainty over the FTSE 250 firm’s future. The London-listed company, which offers investors the chance to make money from the royalties of tracks by artists such as Shakira, Barry Manilow, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Blondie, had launched a strategic review last year to assess its business options, including a potential sale, after a revolt by shareholders over a planned catalogue sell-off and its business plans. More here. The Financial Times’ Lex column argues today that it could make sense to put Thames Water into a special administration. Lex writes: A swift demise is better than a slow one. That would certainly be true for Thames Water. A period of temporary public stewardship is generally framed as a worst-case scenario in discussions about the future of Britain’s biggest privatised water utility. But putting Thames Water into a special administration regime — and quickly — would have its benefits. To be clear, a scenario where Thames is run temporarily by a special administrator on behalf of the UK government remains, at present, hypothetical. Lex warns that if Thames can’t raise new equity, it would have to slash costs, meaning its already-poor service levels would deteriorate further. Alternatively, a special administration might limit fallout for other utilities and provide a chance to tackle its unwieldy structure, they say. This might not be popular with Thames’s bondholders, Lex adds, as they could be forced to take a haircut, but investors in other water companies might approve, as it could stop the crisis spreading. More here: Thames Water could benefit from a spell of public ownership A special administration could be triggered by the secretary of state or Ofwat. Oxford professor Dieter Helm has argued it would be wise to “grasp the opportunity” provided by a special administration, and push through “a fundamental re-set” of Thames. In an excellent analysis last month, Professor Helm wrote that Thames Water’s complex ownership should be straightened out, and it should be completely separated from parent company Kemble. He also suggests the company is simply too large, and could be split into “London Water”; and “Greater Thames Water”, and that the sewerage and water operations “can and should” be separated into different businesses, which would improve management focus. Last month, the Liberal Democrats called for Thames Water should be put into special administration by the government and reformed as a public benefit company. Prof Helm says the government is reluctant to press the special administration button in the Thames Water case comes from a fear of upsetting foreign investors. He explained: The UK has got itself into a position of relying on the kindness of strangers to allow its citizens to live beyond their means, and for almost all financing of investment across the economy. There are two reasons for this exposed state of affairs: net saving (after capital depreciation) has been negative for over a decade; and the current account of the balance of payments is in serious deficit, with imports exceeding exports. UK investment is largely foreign investment; and the trade deficit requires a capital inflow to offset the current-account deficit. In the property sector, London estate agent Foxtons’ has reported a strong start to the year. Sales revenue grew by 17% in the first quarter of 2024, to £9.5m, as the agency took a larger share of the market. CEO Guy Gittins explains: We entered the second quarter with the highest value under-offer Sales pipeline since the 2016 Brexit vote, giving us optimism for the rest of the year. Lettings revenue rose by 5% in the quarter to £24.0m. Foxtons reports that rental prices have “stabilised” as supply and demand of tenancies has normalised. Water campaigner Feargal Sharkey is urging environment secretary Steve Barclay to ‘do your job’ and put Thames Water out of its misery….. Budget airline easyJet has narrowed its losses, despite losing revenue from cancelling flights to Israel and Jordon last winter. EasyJet reported this morning that its losses for the six months to the end of March have fallen by over £50m, to between £340m and £360m. The airline says it grew capacity where demand was strongest. It also benefitted from the early timing of Easter this year, which led to more demand for flights in March. Shares in easyJet have jumped 4% in early trading, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Johan Lundgren, CEO of easyJet, argues the airline is well set up operationally for this summer season, saying: The importance that consumers place on travel coupled with easyJet’s trusted brand has driven good demand for our flights and holidays. Our growth and focus on productivity have reduced winter losses by more than £50 million. “We have further enhanced our network with the launch of new bases in Alicante and Birmingham providing greater choice for consumers across Europe EasyJet also lost around £40m due to the conflict in the Middle East, after it paused flights to Israel and nearby Jordan for safety reasons after the 7th October attacks. It faces further lost business in the months ahead, after suspending flights to Tel Aviv for the next six months earlier this week. Sales of electric cars across the European Union tumbled by over 11% last month, new figures show, in the latest sign that demand for battery-powered vehicles is ebbing in favour of hybrid cars. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) reported this morning that new car registrations fell for the first time this year in March, dropping by 5.2% to around one million units. The timing of the Easter holidays negatively impacted sales, ACEA says, including in the EU’s four largest countries – Germany (‑6.2%), Spain (-4.7%), Italy (-3.7%), and France (-1.5%). Battery-electric car registrations declined by 11.3% to 134,397 units, meaning its market share shrank from 13.9% a year ago to 13% today. In contrast, hybrid-electric car registrations rose by 12.6%. There was also a drop in sales of internal combustion engine-powered cars; petrol sales decreased by 10.2%, while diesel registrations shrank by 18.5%. In the energy sector, Iran is exporting more oil than at any time for the past six years, new data shows. Data company Vortexa has reported that Tehran sold an average of 1.56mn barrels a day during the first three months of the year, almost all of it to China. That’s its highest level since the third quarter of 2018. This is giving Iran’s economy a $35bn-a-year boost, the Financial Times reports this morning, at a time when Western governments are drawing up fresh sanctions following Iran’s drone and missile attack against Israel last weekend. Iran’s oil sector is already under sanctions, but it was still the world’s second largest source of supply growth in 2023. Earlier this week US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said the Biden administration was poised to take “additional sanctions action against Iran in the coming days”, adding that there may be “more to do” on Tehran’s oil trade. Vortexa’s data shows how this could be a challenge. As Fernando Ferreira, head of geopolitical risk service at the Rapidan Energy Group in the US, put it to the FT: “The Iranians have mastered the art of sanctions circumvention. “If the Biden administration is really going to have an impact, it has to shift the focus to China.” More here…. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Thames Water must sort out its own financial problems, chancellor Jeremy Hunt has declared, as the future of the trouble water company hangs in the balance. Speaking in Washington last night, Hunt told reporters that the government would never insure investors against poor decisions. During a visit to Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, the chancellor said: “It would be completely wrong for Thames Water customers to pick up the tab for bad decisions by Thames Water’s owners and managers.” Hunt’s comments come as Thames Water prepares to tap the debt markets in an attempt to fund a rescue plan and repair its finances. Its board is expected to meet today to rubber-stamp a revised five-year spending plan, which could be released tomorrow; it would then approach lenders to fund the proposals in the coming days. The Guardian reported last weekend that Thames Water – which has debts of £14bn - has just six weeks to convince its regulator that it has a viable survival plan for its business. Although it could have enough cash to survive for about 15 months, insiders and investors fear that it must move quickly to strike a deal with its watchdog to stave off insolvency. Its parent company, Kemble Water Finance, missed an interest payment earlier this month, after its investors abandoned plans to provide £500m of emergency funding in a row with the water regulator. Thames has been pushing Ofwat to let it raise bills by 40%. Hunt said the government was prepared for “all possible outcomes”, but also denied that the UK’s reputation as a destination for international investment would suffer if Thames Water fell into administration. The chancellor argues that markets need to work properly, saying: “Of course we want to attract investment into the UK but we do that on the basis of laws and making sure we have transparent regulation and people are able to get very good returns.” The agenda 7am BST: EU car sales for March 10am BST: Eurozone construction output for February 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless data",

        "title": "EasyJet cuts winter losses despite cancelled flights due to Israel-Gaza war",
        "content": "EasyJet has cut its winter losses by at least £50m and said it is confident of a record summer, despite higher fuel costs and a £40m loss from the war in the Middle East. The airline said it expects pre-tax losses of between £340m and £360m for the traditionally loss-making six months to the end of March, in a trading update before its half-year results. EasyJet said demand for flights had rebounded after a six-week “softening” in searches and bookings from the start of the Israel-Gaza war in October. The carrier said the net loss from cancelled flights to Israel and Jordan was about £40m, from refunds and lost revenue. EasyJet has now extended until October the suspension of Tel Aviv flights announced this week after Iran’s drone attack. The airline said it expected little direct financial impact from its decision in the coming months. The region, including Egypt, accounts for a far smaller fraction of easyJet’s operations in summer, down to 0.3% from about 4% in the winter months. The airline’s first-half profits were boosted by an early Easter, falling in March this year, offsetting a £140m rise in its fuel bill compared with 2023. It said it had been partly protected from rising oil prices in 2024 with 70% of fuel hedged below the current price. The easyJet chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said: “Bookings continue to build well and we’re confident of building a record summer performance.” The airline has not given formal guidance for full-year profits, with only about 30% of peak season so far sold, but, according to Lundgren, analyst consensus is “£100m better this summer compared to last year’s record summer, so that gives some idea”. The group’s holiday arm, easyJet Holidays, has grown by 35% year on year and is 70% booked for summer. Lundgren said easyJet would be one of the fastest-growing airlines in Europe this year, with new bases in Alicante and Birmingham contributing to 94 new routes, while overall seat capacity would increase by another 8% year on year, with deliveries of 16 additional Airbus aircraft in 2024. He said reduction of winter losses was “a pillar” of the airline’s strategy, adding: “This is a step in that direction … I think we have surprised the market, given the fact there are two wars going on, where we are with the cost of living challenge and high fuel prices, that we can reduce them, and we want to do more.” Shares in easyJet rose almost 3% in early trading on Thursday.",

        "title": "UK music investor Hipgnosis agrees £1.1bn takeover by Concord Chorus",
        "content": "The embattled British music royalties investment fund Hipgnosis, which owns the rights to songs by artists from Beyoncé to Neil Young, has agreed to a $1.4bn (£1.1bn) takeover by a music and theatrical rights rival after months of turmoil over the company’s structure and leadership. The Concord Chorus deal, which offers Hipgnosis shareholders a 32% premium to Thursday’s share price at $1.16 a share, could put an end to uncertainty over the FTSE 250 firm’s future. The London-listed company, which offers investors the chance to make money from the royalties of tracks by artists such as Shakira, Barry Manilow, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Blondie, had launched a strategic review last year to assess its business options, including a potential sale, after a revolt by shareholders over a planned catalogue sell-off and its business plans. However, investors responded positively to Concord’s offer, sending shares in the once-high-flying FTSE 250 business up 30% to 92p in early trading. It marks the latest acquisition for Concord, which successfully bought another rival – Round Hill Royalty Fund – last year. The firm’s website says it owns or administers about 1m copyrighted musical works for artists ranging from Phil Collins and Cyndi Lauper to M.I.A and Leonard Bernstein. Robert Naylor, the chair of Hipgnosis, said: “The acquisition represents an attractive opportunity for our shareholders to immediately realise their holding at a premium, mitigating the risks we see ahead to achieving a material improvement in the share price. “At the same time, the board is confident that Concord, one of the world’s leading independent music companies, is the right owner to take on the Hipgnosis catalogue and manage it in the interests of composers and performers.” However, plans to de-list Hipgnosis from the UK stock market are likely to spark further anxiety across the City and Whitehall, where leaders are concerned that London is losing out to rival exchanges abroad and to firms taking UK-listed companies private. Hipgnosis was founded in 2018 by Merck Mercuriadis, a former manager of acts including Elton John, Iron Maiden, Guns N’ Roses and Beyoncé, who is now an adviser to the business. It went on to spend billions of pounds buying catalogues in an effort to cash in on what it believed were assets undervalued in the streaming era. That catalogue meant Hipgnosis could earn royalties every time one of the tens of thousands of songs to which it owns the rights was played. But its future was thrown into question in October, when shareholders voted against continuing the business as an investment trust. Investors also ousted the Hipgnosis chair, Andrew Sutch, and voted against a $440m sale of the company’s music catalogues to a partnership between its investment adviser and funds advised by Blackstone. It left the company with no option but to rebuild its board and propose alternative business plans, or face potentially being wound up within six months, leaving the firm with a looming April deadline. Hipgnosis faced a fresh blow in March, after an independent review cut the value of its music portfolio by 26%. It also suspended shareholder payouts and said it would use any free cash to pay down its debts. The company had already been forced to sell about 20,000 unspecified “non-core” songs for $23.1m in December to try cover its debt payments, marking a 14% discount on their valuation in September. Commenting on the takeover offer, which will have to be approved by Hipgnosis shareholders, the Concord chief executive, Bob Valentine, said: “We believe we are offering a fair price for Hipgnosis’s catalogues and music assets, giving its shareholders the opportunity to realise their investment at a significant premium to the prevailing share price in cash.”",

        "title": "Australia’s unemployment rate rises to 3.8% in March as employers shed more than 6,000 jobs",
        "content": "Australia’s economy shed 6,600 jobs last month as employers responded to weak demand by trimming staff numbers. The unemployment rate in March was 3.8%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced on Thursday, rising from February’s 3.7%. A total of 27,900 full-time jobs were added in March, but the economy shed 34,500 part-time roles. The net 6,600 job loss compared with a gain of 10,000 positions economists had tipped. This tally has been volatile in recent months, including a surprising 116,500 leap in employment in February. The participation rate dropped 0.1 percentage points to 66.6%, while total hours worked edged 1m higher to 1.93bn. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “The labour market remained relatively tight in March, with an employment-to-population ratio and participation rate still close to their record highs in November 2023,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS. “While they have both fallen by 0.4 percentage points since then, they continue to be much higher than their pre-pandemic levels.” Both the Reserve Bank of Australia and Treasury had predicted the unemployment rate would rise modestly as the effect of 13 official interest rate rises is squeezing demand in the economy. The organisations expect the jobless rate to reach about 4.3% by June. Australia’s labour market has been strong since the rebound from the Covid pandemic. Unemployment touched 3.4% in November 2022, the lowest since the 1970s. Prior to the release of the labour force figures, investors were betting there was only a minimal chance the RBA would use its next board meeting on 6-7 May to cut the cash rate. Expectations for the timing of the first rate reduction has lately pushed out into next year, with a 25 basis-point cut now only fully priced in by March. Markets barely budged on the news, indicating there were few surprises. The dollar was hovering above the 64.3 US-cent mark, with stocks holding on to most of their gains of just under 0.5% for the day. Among the states, most of the big markets saw the jobless rate tick higher last month. In New South Wales the unemployment rate rose to 3.8% from 3.6% in February, while both Queensland’s and Victoria’s rose to 4.1% from 3.9%. South Australia’s jobless rate jumped to 3.9% from a nation-leading 3.2% in February, while Tasmania clocked the best improvement. Its March unemployment rate was 3.8%, down from 4.5%. The ACT returned to the top of the pile. Its jobless rate sank to 2.9% from 4.2% in February. The national seasonally adjusted underemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage points to 6.5%, the ABS said. While that rate has picked up 0.2 percentage points since March a year ago, it remained 2.3 percentage points lower than the pre-pandemic level of March 2020. The underutilisation rate, which combines the unemployment and underemployment rates, remained at 10.3%. The ABS said the tally was half a percentage point higher than March 2023 and 3.6 percentage points lower than three years earlier. Warren Hogan, chief economist at Judo Bank, said the March figures consolidated the previous month’s big jobs gain. “The economy is picking up again after the consumer-led slowdown last year,” Hogan said, adding that “we look like we are wandering off the narrow path” set by the RBA. “[That’s] great news for economic activity and employment but not so great for interest rates,” he said. KPMG economist Michael Malakellis said the labour data won’t “ease the RBA’s ongoing concerns about excess demand in the economy and labour market”. “The unemployment rate remains low and the labour market is displaying resilience,” he said. The RBA’s monthly bulletin, also released on Thursday, included a paper from its own economists that examined whether the economy was near “full employment”. “We cannot directly observe the level of full employment, but we know it varies over time due to structural changes in the labour market,” they said. At least on a range of historical measures, the current labour market remains tight. Still, “simply looking at the current level of indicators relative to history can be misleading and there may also be developments that models do not fully capture”, they cautioned.",
